    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to the day of the accident. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm driving home from work. The radio's on, playing some R&B. I remember feeling good, you know? I had a productive day at the office.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching an intersection. The light's green, so I'm not slowing down. Then... then I see this flash of red from the corner of my eye. It's... it's coming so fast.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I... I can't breathe. I'm gripping the steering wheel so tight my knuckles are white. I want to turn, to avoid it, but there's no time. No time at all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. Maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* The impact... God, the impact. It's like a bomb going off. The sound of metal crunching, glass shattering. My body jerks violently. I taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Everything's spinning. The airbag's in my face, and there's this acrid smell. Smoke, maybe? I'm... I'm trapped. I can't move my legs. Panic's setting in.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. This is it. I'll never see my girlfriend again. Never get to say goodbye. It's not fair. I'm not ready.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. Maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, you're right. I'm here. I made it. *deep breath* I hear sirens in the distance. People are shouting outside the car. Someone's telling me to stay still, that help is coming.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The pain. It's... it's everywhere. My chest hurts with every breath. My head's pounding. I'm scared to look down at my legs. I keep fading in and out of consciousness.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear metal groaning. They're cutting me out of the car. The paramedics are talking to me, but their voices sound far away. I'm being lifted onto a stretcher. The sky... the sky looks so blue. It's beautiful, and I remember thinking how strange it was to notice that at a time like this.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's racing, just like it was then. But... but I also feel a bit of relief. Like, I know what's coming next. I know I survive.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: It's a blur of movement and noise. The siren's wailing. I'm in and out of consciousness. They're putting IVs in, asking me questions. I can't seem to focus. Everything hurts.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Will I be okay? Will I walk again? What about work? My girlfriend... oh God, someone needs to call her. I don't want her to worry.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. It's chaos. Bright lights, people shouting. I'm wheeled into the ER. Doctors and nurses swarm around me. They're cutting off my clothes, attaching monitors. The pain is... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing again. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, safe and healing.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yeah... yeah, you're right. Okay. They're taking me for scans. X-rays, CT, I don't know. It's all a blur. I keep thinking about my girlfriend, my family. I hope they know I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm in a hospital room. It's quiet now. The pain's duller - they must have given me something. A doctor's talking to me, explaining my injuries. Broken ribs, concussion, fractured leg. But I'll recover. I'll be okay.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved. So relieved. But also... angry? Why did this happen to me? I didn't do anything wrong. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great, James. Let's continue.",
    "Client: My girlfriend arrives. She's crying, hugging me carefully. I feel guilty for making her worry. But I'm so glad she's here. It makes everything feel more... manageable.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The days blur together. Physical therapy is hard. It hurts. Sometimes I want to give up. But I keep pushing. I have to get better. I have to get my life back.",
    "Therapist: How does that determination feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering. But also exhausting. Some days are better than others. The nightmares start... reliving the crash over and over.",
    "Therapist: What happens in these nightmares?",
    "Client: They're... they're worse than the actual crash. Sometimes I don't survive. Sometimes it's my girlfriend in the car instead of me. I wake up sweating, heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, recalling these nightmares?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. My palms are sweaty just thinking about it. But... but it's not as bad as it used to be. Maybe a 65 on the distress scale?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's focus on your recovery. What was that like?",
    "Client: It was a long process. Frustrating. I wanted to be better immediately. The physical pain was bad, but the emotional toll... that was worse. I felt angry, depressed. Why me? What if I had left work five minutes later?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts to have. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I started seeing a therapist. Talking helped. My girlfriend was amazing, so supportive. I learned to be patient with myself. To celebrate small victories.",
    "Therapist: That's great, James. How does it feel to reflect on your progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually pretty good. I'm proud of how far I've come. There are still bad days, sure. But I'm here. I'm alive. I'm stronger than I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to maybe 40? Talking about it... it's not easy, but it's not as overwhelming as it used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about the accident now?",
    "Client: It's still hard. I still have moments of anger, of fear. But... but I also feel grateful. It's changed my perspective on life. I don't take things for granted anymore. I appreciate the little things more.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. We're nearing the end of our session. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after these sessions. What's your final distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 30. Much better than when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress, James. You've done really well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. This... this helps. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, healing takes time. Be patient with yourself. We'll continue working on this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I'm ready for that. Thanks, doc.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
