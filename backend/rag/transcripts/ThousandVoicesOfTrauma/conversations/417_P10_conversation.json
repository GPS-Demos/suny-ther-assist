    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit on edge today. I've been dreading this, to be honest. The idea of reliving that day... it's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose we should. Just... give me a moment to collect myself. *deep breath* Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's early morning, still dark outside. The fluorescent lights are harsh, making everything look sterile and unreal. I can smell coffee from a nearby cafe. My hands are sweaty as I grip my boarding pass.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking towards the gate. My footsteps echo in the quiet terminal. I can hear the soft whir of those moving walkways. I... I remember thinking how routine it all felt. Just another business trip, you know?",
    "Therapist: Continue. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit anxious, but manageable. Um, so I board the plane. The familiar smell of recycled air hits me. I find my seat - it's by the window. I always choose the window seat. I like to watch the world shrink away during takeoff.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 30? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Keep going. What happens as the plane takes off?",
    "Client: We... we start taxiing. The engines roar to life, and I feel that familiar push back into my seat as we accelerate down the runway. We lift off, and I'm watching the ground fall away. Everything looks so small, so insignificant from up here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you notice next?",
    "Client: We're climbing steadily. The seatbelt sign turns off with a 'ding'. People start to relax, some get up to use the restroom or grab things from the overhead bins. I... I pull out my laptop, thinking I'll get some work done.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: *voice trembles* Then... then it happens. There's a sudden jolt. At first, I think it's just turbulence, but... *breath quickens* it's more violent than that. The plane lurches to one side. My laptop slides off the tray table. People are screaming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Rahul. You're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60? My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're just observing. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. The oxygen masks drop down. There's a hissing sound as they deploy. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands shaking so badly I can barely get it on. The plane is pitching wildly now. I can see... oh god, I can see the wing through my window. It's... it's on fire.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Absolutely terrified. My whole body is tense. I can taste bile in the back of my throat. The woman next to me is sobbing, clutching a rosary. I... I remember thinking, 'This is it. This is how I die.'",
    "Therapist: What's happening around you?",
    "Client: It's chaos. Absolute chaos. Luggage is falling from the overhead bins. People are screaming, praying. The plane is losing altitude fast. I can see the ground rushing up to meet us through the window. I... I close my eyes. I can't bear to watch.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: *voice shaking* It's... it's at 85, maybe 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *audible breathing* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still here. We're still crashing, but... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: There's... there's a deafening roar. The plane hits the ground with such force that I'm slammed forward against my seatbelt. My head whips back and forth. I taste blood - I've bitten my tongue. We're skidding, the metal of the plane screaming as it tears across the ground. And then... silence. Just... eerie silence.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I open my eyes. Everything's blurry at first. There's smoke, making it hard to see. My ears are ringing. I... I unbuckle my seatbelt with shaking hands. People are moaning, crying. Someone's shouting to get out. I can smell fuel.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. Moving on autopilot. My body hurts, but it feels distant, like it's happening to someone else. I stumble to my feet, following the crowd towards the emergency exit.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you exit the plane?",
    "Client: It's... it's surreal. We've crashed in a field. The grass is on fire in places. There's debris everywhere. People are scattered around, some lying still, others helping the injured. The air is thick with smoke and the smell of jet fuel. I... I collapse onto the grass, my legs giving out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Rahul. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75? My heart's pounding, but... I'm here. I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm looking around. Emergency vehicles are arriving. Their sirens pierce through the chaos. Paramedics are rushing towards us. I see a woman cradling her child, both of them covered in soot but alive. I... I start to realize that I've survived. We've survived.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. Relief, guilt, disbelief... they're all swirling together. I'm shaking uncontrollably now. A paramedic approaches me, asks if I'm hurt. I can't even speak. I just nod, and he guides me towards an ambulance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Let's pause here for a moment. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But... there's also a sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced this memory head-on for the first time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50, I think. Still there, but not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *audible breathing* Thank you. This... this was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today, Rahul. We'll continue to work through this in our next session."
