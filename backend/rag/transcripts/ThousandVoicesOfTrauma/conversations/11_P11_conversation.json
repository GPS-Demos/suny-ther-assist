    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always hard to go back to that night. The home invasion... it just brings up so many emotions. I can still hear the sound of the glass breaking downstairs. It's like it happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so overwhelming. I remember hiding in my closet, trying not to breathe too loudly. I kept thinking about my grandchildren's pictures on the nightstand and how I might never see them again. It's silly, I know, but in that moment, it felt so real.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that fear feel today?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... different. I noticed I could pull myself back a bit more this time. Like, I knew I was safe here in your office, even while remembering. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, I suppose. But also confusing. I've spent so long being terrified, it's strange to feel even a little bit of control. I'm not sure how to process that.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up around that?",
    "Client: Well, I wonder if I'm really getting better or if I'm just fooling myself. Part of me feels guilty for not being as scared. Like, does that mean I'm not taking it seriously enough? But another part feels... hopeful? Maybe?",
    "Therapist: How does that hope connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I guess it makes me think that maybe I can get back to living normally someday. You know, not jumping at every little noise or avoiding going out after dark. I'd love to babysit my grandkids overnight again without panicking. That hope... it's tiny, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What helped you feel more grounded during today's session?",
    "Client: I tried that breathing technique you taught me. Counting my breaths... it helped me stay present. And I kept reminding myself that I survived. I'm here, I'm safe. It's over. That mantra... it's starting to sink in, I think.",
    "Therapist: How might you use these strategies moving forward?",
    "Client: I could try using them when I have nightmares or flashbacks at home. Maybe it'll help me calm down faster. And... maybe I could start trying to do some of the things I've been avoiding. Like, perhaps I could have my daughter over for dinner one evening. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But also... I don't know... maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and accomplishment.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to try that dinner with my daughter. And maybe... maybe I could start writing down my thoughts when I feel anxious, like you suggested. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in ages, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thank you again."
