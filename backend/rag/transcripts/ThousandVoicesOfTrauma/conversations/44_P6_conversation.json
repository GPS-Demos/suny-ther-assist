    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the cyberbullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting at my desk, scrolling through my social media. My heart starts racing as I see a flood of notifications. People are sharing embarrassing photos of me from a party. The comments are cruel, calling me names and... (voice trembles) saying I'm worthless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6. My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The messages keep coming. I see people I thought were my friends joining in. My chest feels tight, and I can't breathe properly. I want to throw my phone, but I can't stop reading. Someone threatens to send the photos to my parents...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start crying. I feel so alone and exposed. I want to disappear. My hands are shaking as I try to delete the photos, but they're everywhere. I hear my mom calling me for dinner, but I can't move. I'm frozen, staring at the screen...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (voice breaking) It's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel hot and cold at the same time. My throat's tight, like I can't swallow. I... I remember feeling so helpless and ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" I feel like everyone hates me, like I'll never be able to show my face at school again. I'm worthless... (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (through tears) It's still a 9. I can't... I can't shake this feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next in the memory?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to put the phone down. I curl up on my bed, sobbing. I can hear my parents arguing downstairs, and it makes me feel even more alone. I want to tell them, but I'm too ashamed. I feel like I'm drowning in this secret...",

    "Client: The next day at school is a blur. People whisper and laugh as I walk by. I feel like everyone's staring at me. I skip lunch to hide in the bathroom. My phone keeps buzzing with more messages, but I can't look at it...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 9. My hands are clammy again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally break down and tell my best friend. She hugs me and promises to help. We report the bullying to the school counselor. It doesn't fix everything, but I don't feel so alone anymore...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down again. Maybe a 7? I feel a little lighter talking about getting help.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... kind of relieved? Like I've let out something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did excellent work today. Let's start winding down. Take some deep breaths..."
