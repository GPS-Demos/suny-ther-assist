    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The dingy room, the smell of cheap cigarettes, the fear in those young girls' eyes. It's all so vivid. I can't believe I was part of that world, even if I was just translating. I feel... I feel disgusted with myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The silence. The way those girls wouldn't speak, wouldn't even look at us. They were so young, Dr. Chen. So scared. I keep thinking about my own daughter, how she'd be around their age now if... if I hadn't lost her. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How did revisiting affect you physically?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I felt cold sweat on my palms. There's this tightness in my chest that won't go away. It's like... like I can't breathe properly. And my stomach... I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Those are common reactions. How're you coping?",
    "Client: I'm trying to use those breathing exercises you taught me. They help a little, but... it's hard. I keep seeing their faces. I wonder what happened to them. Did they ever escape? Are they even alive? I should've done something, anything. But I was a coward.",
    "Therapist: You're being hard on yourself. What else?",
    "Client: I... I feel so angry. At the traffickers, at myself, at the world that allows this to happen. But mostly, I feel this crushing guilt. I was complicit in their suffering. How can I ever make amends for that?",
    "Therapist: It's a heavy burden. Any new insights?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see how this experience has shaped so much of my life. My depression, my isolation... it all stems from this, doesn't it? I've been punishing myself for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly freeing. Painful, but freeing. Like maybe there's a way forward. But I'm scared, Dr. Chen. What if I can't move past this?",
    "Therapist: Your fear is valid. What gives you hope?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Maybe the fact that I'm here, trying to face this? That I want to be better? I think about those girls sometimes, and I imagine them healing, moving on with their lives. If they can do it, maybe I can too.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. Next steps?",
    "Client: I want to keep doing these exposures. They're hell, but... I think they're helping. And maybe... maybe I could look into organizations that help trafficking victims. Not to ease my guilt, but to actually make a difference this time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds meaningful. How else can we support you?",
    "Client: I... I think I need help processing this anger and guilt. And maybe... maybe it's time I start opening up to people in my life. The loneliness, it's killing me slowly.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. Anything else?",
    "Client: I... I want to thank you, Dr. Chen. For not judging me, for helping me face this. I know we have a long way to go, but... I feel like there might be light at the end of this very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. Proud of your progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I'm... I'm going to keep pushing forward. No matter how hard it gets."
