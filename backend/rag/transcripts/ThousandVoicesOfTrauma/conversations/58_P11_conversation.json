    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, you know? Reliving that moment when my ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce... it's bringing up all these old feelings. I can still see her face, the way she looked at me with such... disappointment. It's like I'm right back there in our kitchen, feeling so small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you about that experience?",
    "Client: The silence. After she said it, there was this deafening silence. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening.\" But it was. And then I started remembering all the times I was bullied in school, how those kids made me feel worthless. It's like... it's like my ex-wife confirmed what those bullies always said about me. That I wasn't good enough.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. For a moment, I thought I might have a panic attack. But then I remembered the breathing exercises we've been practicing, and that helped a bit. Still, I can't shake this feeling of... I don't know, shame? Like I've failed at something fundamental.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been avoiding relationships since the divorce. Every time I think about putting myself out there, I hear those bullies' voices, and then I see my ex-wife's face. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the next person to reject me or leave me. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned from this process?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see how much those past experiences are still affecting me. I've been carrying this weight around for so long, and it's impacting everything - my work, my friendships, even how I see myself. But going through this memory again, as painful as it is, it's like... I'm finally facing it head-on instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe I can start challenging those negative thoughts more. When I hear those old voices telling me I'm not good enough, I can remind myself that those are just echoes from the past, not the truth. And maybe... maybe I can start being a bit kinder to myself. I've been so hard on myself for so long, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. What else?",
    "Client: I think I want to try reconnecting with some old friends. I've been isolating myself a lot since the divorce, but I'm realizing that I need support. And maybe... maybe I can even consider dating again at some point. Not right away, but... it's not off the table anymore.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard work, I won't lie. Some days I wonder if it's worth it. But then I have moments like this, where I can see a glimmer of hope. I'm starting to believe that maybe I can move past this, you know? That I'm not doomed to be defined by my past experiences. It's scary, but also... kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: That's great. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep working on these imaginal exposures. They're tough, but I can see how they're helping me process things. And I want to start practicing more self-compassion. Maybe I can try writing down some positive affirmations or something? I don't know, does that sound silly?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How else can you support yourself?",
    "Client: Well, I've been thinking about joining a support group for divorced men. I've been hesitant because, you know, opening up to strangers is scary. But after today's session, I'm thinking it might be good to connect with others who've been through similar experiences. And maybe... maybe I can even share some of what I'm learning here. It could help someone else, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also, there's this sense of... I don't know, lightness? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years. It's not gone completely, but it feels more manageable now. And I'm proud of myself for getting through today's session. It wasn't easy, but I did it. That's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to dive deeper into how the bullying experiences are connected to my divorce. There's something there, a pattern maybe, that I want to understand better. And maybe we can work on some more strategies for challenging those negative thoughts when they come up. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I've said it before, but I really appreciate your guidance through all this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. And that... that means a lot to me."
