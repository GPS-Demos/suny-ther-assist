    "Therapist: Okay, Carlos, let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the moment the earthquake started.",
    "Client: I was in my living room, watching TV with my wife. Suddenly, the ground started shaking. It was gentle at first, but then it got stronger. The pictures on the wall began to rattle, and I heard a loud rumbling noise. My heart started racing, and I felt a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The shaking got more intense. I could hear things falling and breaking in the kitchen. My wife screamed, and I grabbed her hand. We tried to move towards the doorway, but it was hard to keep our balance. The floor felt like it was moving in waves under our feet.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay, Carlos. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The power went out, and it was pitch black. I could hear our neighbors shouting and crying. The noise was deafening - a mixture of the earth groaning and things crashing all around us. I felt so helpless, like the world was ending and there was nothing I could do.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and my breathing is getting faster. The SUDS is probably an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The shaking seemed to last forever. When it finally stopped, everything was silent for a moment. Then I heard people crying and calling for help. We stumbled out of the house, and I saw our neighborhood in ruins. Houses collapsed, cars overturned. It was like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I saw our elderly neighbor trapped under some debris. I ran to help her, but I was shaking so much I could barely lift anything. I felt so useless, so weak. I kept thinking about my children, wondering if they were okay. The guilt of not being able to protect everyone was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: The SUDS has gone down a bit, maybe to a 7. I feel drained, but also a little relieved to be talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How did the experience end?",
    "Client: Eventually, rescue workers arrived. They helped us free our neighbor. We spent the night in a makeshift shelter, surrounded by other scared and injured people. I couldn't sleep, kept expecting another quake. When morning came, the full extent of the destruction was visible. Our home, our life's work, everything was gone.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for having talked about it.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Carlos. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we discuss your experience."
