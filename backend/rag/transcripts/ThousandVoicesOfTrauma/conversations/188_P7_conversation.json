    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Doc. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about diving into this again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about that night, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It was a Tuesday evening. I remember because I had just finished watching my favorite game show. I heard shouting from next door...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The walls in this place are thin, you know? I could hear everything. A man's voice, angry, slurring his words. Then a woman, pleading, crying. I... I froze.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I should have done something. Called the police, banged on the wall, anything. But I just sat there, listening. The sounds... they got worse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: There was a loud crash, like furniture being knocked over. Then I heard her scream. It was... God, it was terrible. I've never heard anything like it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I finally got up. My legs were shaking so bad I could barely walk. I went to the phone, but... but I couldn't bring myself to dial. I was a coward.",
    "Therapist: You're not a coward. You're here, facing this.",
    "Client: Maybe. But in that moment, I felt like one. The screaming stopped, and that silence... it was worse than the noise. I thought... I thought he might have killed her.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: It was. I still have nightmares about it. I keep hearing that scream, seeing the shadows under my door... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're processing it now.",
    "Client: I guess. After what felt like hours, I heard sirens. Someone else must have called. I saw them take him away in handcuffs, her in an ambulance. I never even knew their names.",
    "Therapist: You've recalled a lot of details. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained. Angry at myself. Scared. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. It's... it's hard. But I want to get past this. I'm tired of feeling afraid in my own home.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's keep going. There's more... After they left, I couldn't sleep. I kept replaying it in my mind, thinking of all the things I should have done...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. Take your time.",
    "Client: I sat by the window all night, watching the street. Every sound made me jump. When morning came, I saw her... the woman. She was packing a suitcase into a cab.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved, I guess. But also... guilty. I wanted to go down, to apologize for not helping. But I couldn't face her.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. You're processing them well.",
    "Client: I've never told anyone this before. For weeks after, I'd wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I heard screaming. I started sleeping with the TV on just to drown out any noises.",
    "Therapist: That's a common coping mechanism. You're not alone in this.",
    "Client: I know it's been years, but sometimes... sometimes it feels like it just happened. Like I'm still that scared old man, paralyzed by fear.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage by facing this memory.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. It helps to talk about it, even though it's hard. I just... I just wish I could forgive myself.",
    "Therapist: Self-forgiveness is a process. We'll work on that together.",

    "Client: I appreciate that. It's funny, in a way. I've lived through wars, seen all sorts of things. But this... this broke something in me.",
    "Therapist: Trauma affects us all differently. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. I just... I keep wondering about her. If she's okay. If she got help. If she's still afraid...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these thoughts. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... maybe a little lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. I think... I think I'm ready to stop for now. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made excellent progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. Same time next week?",
