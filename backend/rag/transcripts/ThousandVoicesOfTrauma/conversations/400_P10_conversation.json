    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to do this, to face these memories, but another part that's... well, terrified. My hands are already starting to feel clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the camp. It's early morning, the sun's barely up. The air is thick with dust and... and fear. I can hear children crying in the distance. God, it's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's... there's shouting. People are running. I... I see my wife, she's clutching our youngest. Her eyes are wide with panic. I... I reach for her hand, but there's so many people pushing, shoving. The sound of gunfire erupts and I... I lose sight of her in the crowd.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure, unbridled terror. My heart's pounding so hard I can barely breathe. I... I need to find her, to protect them, but I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 80, 85? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I... I push through the crowd. People are screaming, falling. The dust is so thick I can barely see. I trip over something... someone... I don't want to look down. I just keep moving, calling their names.",
    "Therapist: What do you hear?",
    "Client: Chaos. Gunfire, screaming, the sound of vehicles. And... and my own voice, hoarse from shouting. I hear myself begging, pleading to anyone who'll listen. \"Have you seen my family? Please, help me find my family!\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present in that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see a familiar flash of color. It's the dress my wife was wearing. I push harder, faster. My lungs are burning, but I don't care. I reach out and... and I grab her arm. She turns and... oh God, the relief on her face. Our eyes meet and for a moment, just a moment, everything else fades away.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. My heart's still racing, adrenaline pumping. But there's this... this wave of relief that washes over me. My legs feel weak, like they might give out.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We... we hold onto each other tightly. I can feel our child between us, crying. I look around, trying to figure out where to go. The camp's burning now, thick black smoke filling the air. We start moving, staying low, trying to avoid the gunfire.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"We have to survive this. We have to get out.\" It's like a mantra in my head. But there's also this... this overwhelming sense of loss. Our home, our community... everything we've known is being destroyed around us.",
    "Therapist: How does that loss feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a physical weight. My shoulders feel heavy, my chest aches. It's hard to breathe, and not just because of the smoke.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we make it to the edge of the camp. There are vehicles, people cramming into them. I lift my wife and child into the back of a truck. As I climb in after them, I look back. The camp... our home... it's engulfed in flames. The sky is black with smoke. I... I can still hear screams.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you look back?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. We're escaping, but so many others... friends, neighbors... they're still there. I feel like I should go back, try to help. But I... I can't. I have to protect my family.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How does it sit with you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still there. A knot in my stomach. I know logically that I couldn't have done more, but... but it doesn't stop the feeling.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 75. The guilt... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The truck starts moving. We're packed in tight, everyone is silent except for the sound of muffled crying. I hold my wife and child close. The road is bumpy, and every jolt feels like it might be a bullet. I keep looking back, expecting to see pursuers.",
    "Therapist: What do you see when you look back?",
    "Client: Smoke. Just... just a huge plume of black smoke on the horizon. Our entire lives, reduced to ash. I... I feel so helpless, so angry. Why us? Why our people?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. How does your body respond to that anger?",
    "Client: My... my fists are clenched. My jaw is tight. I want to scream, to fight back somehow. But I can't. All I can do is hold my family and pray we make it to safety.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens as you continue your journey?",
    "Client: We... we drive for hours. The sun is high in the sky now. People are getting sick from the heat, the lack of water. My child is crying, and I feel so... so powerless. I can't even provide basic comfort.",
    "Therapist: How does that powerlessness feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. I've always been the provider, the protector. And now... now I can't do anything. I feel like I'm failing them.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? The feeling of failure... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in a safe place. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we finally reach a border. There are soldiers, aid workers. It's chaos, but a different kind. People are pushing, trying to get help. I... I remember the relief of seeing water, food. But also the fear. What happens now? Where do we go from here?",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that uncertainty?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay strong for my family. But inside, I'm terrified. We have nothing. No home, no possessions. Just the clothes on our backs. I... I remember looking at my wife, seeing the fear in her eyes, and promising her that somehow, someway, we'd be okay.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How does it feel to recall that promise?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm proud that I could offer her some comfort, but... but also scared. Because even now, years later, I'm not sure I've fully kept that promise. We're safe, yes, but... but okay? I don't know.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level as we near the end of this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 65? The immediate danger is past in the memory, but the weight of everything... it's still there.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I... I can still see it all so clearly. Feel it. The dust in my throat, the fear in my gut.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels... lighter? Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've done important work today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It wasn't easy, but... but I think it was necessary.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. We'll continue to work through this together."
