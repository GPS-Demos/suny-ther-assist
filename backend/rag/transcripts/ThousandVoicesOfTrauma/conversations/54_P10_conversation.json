    "Therapist: Good morning, Maria. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Johnson. I... I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. My hands are a little shaky. But I know this is important work we're doing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at work. What do you see?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm in my office at the law firm. It's a Tuesday morning, around 10 AM. The sun is streaming through the blinds, creating stripes on my desk. I can smell coffee from the break room... and... and a faint whiff of Lola's perfume.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm reviewing some case files when my phone rings. It's... it's my daughter, Carmen. Her voice is shaky. She says, \"Mam\u00e1, it's Pap\u00e1. He... he collapsed at the grocery store.\" My heart starts racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest right now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? It's... it's getting harder to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... I... I grab my purse and rush out of the office. I barely remember to tell my assistant I have a family emergency. The elevator feels so slow. I keep pressing the button, as if that will make it go faster. My hands are shaking as I try to find my car keys.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I can't lose him. Not yet. We were supposed to have more time. I promised to take him back to Cuba next year. Oh Dios m\u00edo, please let him be okay.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm driving to the hospital now. The traffic is terrible. I'm honking at everyone, probably scaring other drivers. I feel like I'm going to be sick. When I finally get there, I run into the emergency room. The smell of disinfectant hits me... it's so strong. I see Carmen in the waiting area. Her eyes are red and puffy.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you see Carmen?",
    "Client: I... I pull her into a hug. She's trembling. \"They won't tell me anything, Mam\u00e1,\" she says. We sit down, and I hold her hand. It feels like hours before a doctor comes out. His face is... is so serious. My stomach drops.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now, Maria?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here in my office. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The doctor says... he says Roberto had a massive heart attack. They couldn't... they couldn't save him. I feel like the floor is falling away beneath me. Carmen starts sobbing, and I... I just feel numb. This can't be real. We just had breakfast together this morning. He kissed me goodbye and said he'd pick up groceries for dinner.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, Maria. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I have to be strong for Carmen. I pull her close and stroke her hair, like I did when she was little. But inside, I'm screaming. How am I supposed to go on without him? We've been together for 50 years. I don't know how to be alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I'm back there. My chest hurts. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel the chair beneath you. Listen to my voice. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Gracias. I... I'm okay. The doctor asks if we want to see Roberto. Carmen nods, but I'm terrified. What if he doesn't look like himself? What if this makes it too real?",
    "Therapist: And do you go see him?",
    "Client: S\u00ed... yes. We follow the doctor to a small room. Roberto is lying there, so still. He looks... he looks like he's sleeping. I keep expecting him to open his eyes and smile at me. I take his hand... it's still warm. That's when it really hits me. He's gone. My Roberto is gone.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest. I start crying, really crying. I haven't cried like that since I was a little girl. Carmen is holding me up. I can hear her saying, \"It's okay, Mam\u00e1. Let it out.\" But it's not okay. Nothing will ever be okay again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Maria. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) I... I'm trying. It just hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: I know it does. You're very brave for facing this. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we have to leave the room. There are forms to fill out, decisions to make. I feel like I'm moving through a fog. How can the world still be turning when mine has stopped? I have to call our son in New York. How do I tell him his father is gone?",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How do you manage?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how I do it. I just know I have to. For my children, for Roberto. I make the call from the hospital parking lot. Juan... he breaks down on the phone. I want to comfort him, but I have no comfort to give. I feel so empty.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My eyes burn from crying. My chest aches. But... but I also feel a little lighter. Like I've let some of the pain out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're processing a very difficult memory. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7, I think. Still high, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... your degrees on the wall. The plant in the corner. The box of tissues on the table. My purse on the floor. And... and the sunlight coming through the window.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, take a deep breath and slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) That was... that was intense. I didn't realize how much I was still holding onto.",
    "Therapist: You did very well, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... also a little relieved. Like I've shared some of the burden.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've taken an important step in processing your loss. We'll end our session here, but I want you to practice some self-care for the rest of the day. Is there someone you can spend time with?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I'm meeting Carmen for lunch. I think... I think I'll tell her about this session.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember, what you're feeling is normal. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Gracias, Dr. Johnson. I... I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. I'll see you next week. Take care."
