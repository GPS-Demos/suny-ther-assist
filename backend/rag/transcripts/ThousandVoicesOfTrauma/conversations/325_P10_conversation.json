    "Therapist: Welcome back, Priya. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go through this together. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* I'm sitting in our living room. It's a Saturday afternoon, and the house is quiet. Too quiet. I can hear the clock ticking on the wall, and it's making me nervous. Sanjay should be home soon, and I know we need to talk. I've been avoiding this conversation for weeks, but I can't anymore. My stomach is in knots, and my hands are shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear his car pull up in the driveway. My heart starts racing. I stand up, smooth my clothes, and try to look calm. The front door opens, and Sanjay walks in. He looks tired, maybe a bit wary. He knows something's up. I say, \"Hi, can we talk?\" and he nods, dropping his bag by the door.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: We sit down on the couch, and there's this awful silence. I can't look at him directly. I start talking, my voice shaky. \"Sanjay, I... I think we need to separate.\" The words hang in the air, and I feel like I can't breathe. He doesn't say anything at first, just stares at me. Then he asks, \"Why?\" His voice is so cold, it makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see and feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I see the hurt and anger in his eyes. It's like a physical blow. I'm trying to explain, stumbling over my words. \"We've grown apart... I'm not happy... I think you're not happy either.\" But as I'm saying it, I can see him getting more and more agitated. He stands up suddenly, and I instinctively lean back. *voice quivers* He's never hit me before, but in that moment, I'm afraid he might.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 now. *deep, shaky breath*",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathes slowly* Okay... okay. I can continue. Sanjay starts pacing, running his hands through his hair. He's shouting now, asking how I could do this to him, to our families. I'm crying, trying to explain, but he's not listening. He picks up a vase - the one his mother gave us for our wedding - and for a second, I think he's going to throw it at me. But he hurls it against the wall instead. The crash is so loud, I jump.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. My hands are ice cold, and I'm shaking all over. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. I can smell Sanjay's cologne mixed with the scent of the flowers that were in the vase. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sanjay is still yelling, but now he's crying too. He's saying I've betrayed him, that I never loved him. Each word feels like a knife. I'm sobbing, trying to tell him that's not true, that I did love him, but things changed. He won't listen. He storms out of the room, and I hear him in the bedroom, slamming drawers and closet doors. I'm terrified he's going to hurt himself or destroy something else.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. *voice breaks* This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take another deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I follow him to the bedroom. Clothes are strewn everywhere. He's throwing things into a suitcase. When he sees me, he stops. The look on his face... it's like he doesn't even know me anymore. He says, \"I hope you're happy now,\" and pushes past me. I'm begging him not to leave like this, to talk to me, but he's not listening. He grabs his keys and heads for the door. I run after him, pleading. But he gets in his car and drives away. I'm left standing in the driveway, watching his taillights disappear. I feel... I feel so alone. So guilty. Like I've destroyed everything.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Priya. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My SUDS is probably around 85 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: *sniffles* Um, I see... the plant in the corner, your desk, the clock on the wall, the painting of the ocean, and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The couch cushion, my necklace, my clothes, and... and my hair.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The air conditioning, some traffic outside, and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Two things you smell?",
    "Client: The lavender air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: Last one. One thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... the lingering taste of the water I drank earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Priya. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about 70, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Can you tell me what was the most difficult part of that memory to revisit?",
    "Client: *sighs* The moment when I saw the hurt in Sanjay's eyes. And when he threw the vase... I was so scared. I felt like I was destroying not just our marriage, but our entire lives.",
    "Therapist: Those are intense moments. How do you feel about having shared them?",
    "Client: It was really hard, but... I feel a bit lighter? Like I've let out something I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You did very well today. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you... I know this is helping, even if it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Priya. Your courage is admirable. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
