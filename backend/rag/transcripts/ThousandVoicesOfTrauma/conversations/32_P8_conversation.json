    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel a bit shaky. The memories... they felt so real, like I was right back there in that room with the cult leader.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold pit in my stomach. I can still hear his voice, you know? The way he would speak so calmly while... while doing those terrible things. It makes me feel small and helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly distressing. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: Well, my hands are clammy, and I feel a tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. And there's this tension in my shoulders, like I'm bracing for something. I guess... I guess my body still remembers, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to when you're not thinking about the trauma?",
    "Client: They're much more intense now. Usually, I can push these feelings down, you know? But after reliving it like that... it's like all my defenses are stripped away. I feel raw and exposed.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why me? Why did I let this happen? I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but there's this voice in my head saying I should have been stronger, should have found a way out sooner. And then I feel guilty for not helping the others who were still trapped when I finally escaped.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. At him, at the other cult members who didn't help, but mostly at myself. And then I feel ashamed for being angry, because isn't that what they always said? That anger was a sign of weakness? God, it's like they're still in my head sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Grief, I think. For the person I was before all this happened. For the years I lost. And for my wife... she tried so hard to understand, to help me through this. But in the end, it was just too much for her. Too much for us. I miss her, and I feel like I failed her too.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now differ from previous times?",
    "Client: It's... clearer, somehow. Usually, when I think about it, everything gets jumbled up. But going through it step by step like we did, it's like I can see it all laid out. It's painful, but there's also a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe control? Like I'm observing it rather than just reliving it.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that difference?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Part of me feels like it might be a good thing, like maybe I'm starting to process it better. But another part is scared. What if I start remembering more? What if it gets worse before it gets better? I don't know if I'm strong enough for that.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to handle those concerns?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to face them. As terrifying as it is, I'm tired of letting this control my life. My kids, they deserve a father who's present, who isn't always jumping at shadows. And I guess... I guess I deserve that too. To be free of this. But it's hard to believe I'll ever really get there.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: Honestly? Moments like this. Being able to talk about it without completely falling apart. The fact that I can even imagine a life beyond this trauma... that's new. And my kids, they're so resilient. I want to be that for them, to show them that you can survive terrible things and still find joy. I just... I hope I'm not too broken to get there.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to express that hope?",
    "Client: It's... weird. Kind of scary, actually. Like I'm tempting fate or something. But also... there's a warmth in my chest when I think about it. Like maybe, just maybe, there's a light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. I want to believe in that light, even if it's just a tiny flicker right now.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to dig deeper into the guilt. Especially about the others I left behind. I know logically that I couldn't have helped them, that I barely got myself out. But the weight of it... it's crushing sometimes. Maybe if we can work through that, I'll be able to forgive myself a little.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good direction. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if it's just for a moment. There's still so much to work through, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. Thank you for... for helping me see that.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. And... thank you. Really. I know it's your job, but... it means a lot to have someone who can hear all this and not run away. I'll see you next week."
