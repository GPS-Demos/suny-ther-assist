    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous. I mean, I understand why we're doing this, but the idea of reliving that home invasion... it's scary. I've been trying so hard to forget it, you know? And now you want me to remember every detail? I'm not sure I can handle that.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. It's a challenging process, but it's designed to help. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about losing control. What if I panic? Or what if it makes things worse instead of better? I've been having nightmares about it lately, and I'm scared this might make them more intense. Plus, I'm embarrassed about how I reacted during the invasion. I don't want to relive that shame.",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable concerns. How can I support you through this?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain again why this is supposed to help? And what exactly will happen during the exposure? I think I need more details to feel prepared. Also, is it normal to feel this anxious about it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely normal. The exposure helps process the memory. We'll go through it step-by-step, and I'll be here throughout. What else?",
    "Client: Okay, that helps a bit. I guess I'm wondering how long it will take? And what if I can't remember everything clearly? Some parts of that night are still a blur. Oh, and will we be doing this every session from now on? I'm not sure I can handle that.",
    "Therapist: It typically lasts about 30-45 minutes. Gaps in memory are normal. We'll focus on what you do remember. Anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. I've been using some... substances to cope with the anxiety lately. I'm worried that without that crutch, this might be too intense. I haven't told you about that before, I'm sorry. I'm just scared of facing this sober. Do you think that will be a problem?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. It's important information. We'll work through this together. How do you feel about trying the exposure now?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Your calm demeanor is helping. Can we start slow? And if it gets too overwhelming, can we take breaks? I want to do this, I really do. I'm tired of living in fear and I know this is supposed to help. I just need to know you'll be there to guide me through it.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace, with breaks as needed. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. Let's do this. I'm taking a deep breath. I trust you, and I'm going to try my best to face this. Thank you for being so patient with me. I know I ask a lot of questions, but it really helps me feel more in control. I'm ready now. What's the first step?"
