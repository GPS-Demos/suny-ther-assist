    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking down the street with my partner. It's a warm evening, and we're holding hands. Suddenly, we hear shouting and see a commotion up ahead. There's a group of police officers surrounding a young Black man. He's on the ground, and they're... they're hitting him with batons. I can hear him crying out for help.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: My heart starts racing. I can feel my palms getting sweaty. The young man is begging them to stop, but they just keep going. I want to do something, but I'm frozen in place. My partner is squeezing my hand so tight it hurts.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest feels tight. It's like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't look away. The officers are yelling at the man to stop resisting, but he's not even moving anymore. There's blood on the pavement. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to run, but my feet won't move. I can hear people around us gasping and crying out.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I'm sweating all over. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I can't... The man isn't moving anymore. The officers are backing away. Someone's calling for an ambulance. I feel like I'm going to throw up. My partner is pulling me away, but I can't stop staring. I feel so helpless, so angry, so scared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking all over. My teeth are chattering. I feel cold and hot at the same time. I can't get the image out of my head.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. It's so intense.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: Okay... We're walking away now. My legs feel like jelly. I can hear sirens in the distance. My partner is saying something, but I can't make out the words. Everything feels muffled and far away. I keep seeing the man's face, hearing his cries. I feel... I feel...",

    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8 now.",
