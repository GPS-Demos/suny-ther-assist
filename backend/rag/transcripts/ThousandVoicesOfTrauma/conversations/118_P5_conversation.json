    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about our last session and what you mentioned about imaginal exposure. It's been on my mind all week.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's talk about it.",
    "Client: Okay... I mean, I know we've been working towards this, but the idea of reliving that earthquake... it's scary. I've spent so much time trying to forget it. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Really? That's... that's good to know. I guess I'm worried about losing control. During the earthquake, I felt so helpless. I don't want to feel that way again.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process, not re-traumatize. You're in control here.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. Can you tell me more about how this is supposed to help? I mean, I understand the theory, but practically speaking, how does reliving a traumatic experience make things better?",
    "Therapist: It helps reduce the power of those memories over time.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like... desensitization? Like, the more I face it, the less it affects me? That makes sense, I guess. But what if it makes things worse instead of better?",
    "Therapist: That's a common worry. We'll monitor your reactions closely.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. What exactly will we be doing? How does this work?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In detail? Like, everything I remember? That's... a lot. There are some parts that are really vivid, and others that are kind of hazy. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Just share what you remember. No pressure to fill gaps.",
    "Client: Alright. And you'll be here the whole time? What if I start to panic or get overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: I'll be right here. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I think having that safety net will help. How long does this usually take? And will we do this multiple times?",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about an hour. We'll repeat as needed.",
    "Client: An hour... okay. That seems like a long time to be in that headspace, but I guess that's part of the process. Will it get easier with each session?",
    "Therapist: Often, yes. Many find it becomes less intense over time.",
    "Client: That's encouraging. I hope that happens for me too. Is there anything I should do to prepare for our next session when we actually start this?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your willingness is all we need.",
    "Client: Okay. I can do that. I'm still nervous, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? If this can help me move past what happened, it'll be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm glad you're here to guide me through this. It makes it feel less daunting.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Any other questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I feel better about it now that we've talked it through. I'll probably have more questions as we go along, but for now, I think I'm as ready as I can be.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll take it step by step next time."
