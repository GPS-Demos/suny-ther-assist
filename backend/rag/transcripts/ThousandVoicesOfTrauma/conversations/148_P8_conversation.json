    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I found out about my son's imprisonment... it's like I'm right back there again. My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. Take a moment to breathe. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how I failed him. I should have seen the signs, should have done more to keep him on the right path. I remember standing in the kitchen when I got that phone call, and just... everything stopped. The world went silent. I felt so powerless, so... ashamed.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of powerlessness sit with you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still there, but it's different. Back then, it was overwhelming, like I was drowning. Now, it's more like... like a weight I'm carrying. I know logically that I couldn't control everything in his life, but emotionally? That guilt is still there, gnawing at me.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else do you notice about your emotions right now?",
    "Client: There's anger, too. Anger at the system, at the people who led him astray, but... also anger at myself. I keep replaying conversations we had, wondering if I could have said something different, done something more. And then there's this profound sadness. My boy, my little boy, behind bars. It's... it's heartbreaking.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you connect with those emotions?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, like I'm bracing for impact. And there's this hollowness in my stomach. It's like... like grief, I suppose. Grief for the life I thought he'd have, for the dreams that died that day. I can still smell the coffee I was brewing when the phone rang. Isn't that strange? Such a mundane detail, but it's seared into my memory.",
    "Therapist: What meaning do you make of that memory being so vivid?",
    "Client: I... I guess it represents the last moment of normalcy. After that call, nothing was ever the same. It's like a before and after snapshot. Before, I was just a regular dad with regular worries. After, I became the father of a convict. It changed how I saw myself, how others saw me. That smell of coffee... it's like a reminder of a life I can't get back to.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on this change in your life make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. There's a deep sadness, of course. But also... I don't know, maybe a kind of acceptance? Not that I'm okay with what happened, but... I've survived it. I'm still here, still fighting for him. And maybe... maybe there's a bit of pride in that. That despite everything, I haven't given up on him or on myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that while the pain is still there, it doesn't consume me like it used to. Talking about it, facing it head-on like this... it's hard, but it's also freeing in a way. I used to avoid thinking about that day at all costs, but now... now I can sit with it. It hurts, but I can breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: How does this ability to sit with the memory change things for you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... stronger, I suppose. Like I'm not at the mercy of my memories anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful, but it's a pain I can manage now. And there's something... I don't know, almost cathartic about letting myself fully feel it instead of pushing it away.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how this experience has changed me. I'm more empathetic now, especially towards other parents going through tough times. I volunteer at a support group for families of incarcerated individuals, and I can connect with them in a way I never could have before. It's like... this horrible thing has given me a purpose, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that purpose affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'd give anything to undo what happened, to have my son free and living a different life. But since I can't change that, being able to help others... it gives some meaning to our suffering. It doesn't make it okay, but it makes it... I don't know, bearable, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound perspective. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying. My chest isn't as tight, and I feel more... present. Talking through it all, really allowing myself to feel it... it's exhausting, but also... cleansing, in a way. I feel like I can face the world a little better now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. What would you like to take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that I can face these memories without being overwhelmed by them. That there's strength in confronting the pain rather than avoiding it. And maybe... maybe I want to work on forgiving myself a little more. I can see now that I've been carrying a lot of blame that isn't mine to carry.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful intention. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready. This was intense, but... good. Really good. I feel like I've made some progress today, even if it's just in how I view things. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy work, but I'm grateful for it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
