    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's really dreading it. My stomach's been in knots all morning.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking home from the library. It's late, maybe around 10 PM. The streetlights are on, casting these long shadows. I can hear my footsteps echoing off the buildings. It's quiet, too quiet.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear shouting coming from an alley up ahead. My heart starts racing. I should just keep walking, but... but I don't. I slow down, trying to see what's happening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 4? It's starting to build.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What do you see in the alley?",
    "Client: There are two men. One's got the other pinned against the wall. They're both big guys, but the one doing the pinning is massive. He's shouting something about money. The other guy, he looks terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. My hands are shaking. I want to help, but I'm frozen. I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: The big guy, he pulls out a knife. It gleams in the streetlight. Oh God, I can see it so clearly. The other man is begging now, pleading. I should do something, call for help, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing. What do you see next?",
    "Client: The knife... the knife goes in. There's a horrible sound, like... like a wet thud. The man screams. It's a sound I'll never forget. And then... then there's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: I feel sick. My stomach's churning. I... I think I might throw up. My legs are weak. I want to run, but I can't look away.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens after that?",
    "Client: The big guy, he... he stabs him again. And again. The other man stops screaming. He just... slumps. And the attacker, he looks up. He looks right at me. Our eyes meet and... and I run. I run as fast as I can.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you run?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I think he's going to come after me. Every shadow looks like him. I can hear footsteps behind me, but I don't know if they're real or just in my head. I... I feel so guilty. I should have done something. I should have helped.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I can feel my heart racing, just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I slam the door behind me and lock it. I'm shaking so hard I can barely turn the key. I slide down to the floor, my back against the door. I can't catch my breath. I keep seeing the knife, the blood, the man's eyes as he fell.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. I should call the police, but I'm scared. What if the attacker finds out? What if he comes for me? I feel so helpless, so guilty. I curl up on the floor and... and I cry. I cry like I haven't since I was a kid.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How long do you stay there?",
    "Client: It feels like hours. My body aches from being tensed up. I keep replaying the scene in my head, over and over. Every time I close my eyes, I see the knife, the blood. I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My hands are shaking just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing. What happens the next morning?",
    "Client: I... I don't sleep. When the sun comes up, I'm still on the floor. I feel... numb. Empty. I force myself to get up, to check the news. There's nothing about the attack. It's like it never happened. But I know it did. I can still see it, still hear it.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused. Angry. Part of me wonders if I imagined it all. But I know I didn't. The memory is too vivid, too real. I feel... I feel like I'm going crazy. Like I'm trapped in this nightmare and I can't wake up.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to go about my day. I have classes, but I can't focus. Everything feels unreal. People are talking, laughing, going about their lives, and I want to scream at them. Don't they know what happened? How can the world just go on?",
    "Therapist: That disconnection is normal after trauma. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense it hurts. My jaw is clenched, my shoulders are up to my ears. I keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see the attacker. Every loud noise makes me jump. I feel... I feel like I'm not in control of my own body anymore.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also kind of relieving.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me more about the days following the incident?",
    "Client: It's... it's all a blur. I stop going to classes. I can't sleep. When I do, I have nightmares. I keep seeing the man's face, hearing his screams. I start drinking to numb myself. It doesn't help, but I don't know what else to do.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your relationships?",
    "Client: I... I push everyone away. My friends try to reach out, but I can't talk to them. How could they understand? I feel so alone, so isolated. But at the same time, I'm afraid to be around people. What if it happens again? What if I freeze up again?",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to deal with. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Talking about it, reliving it... it's draining. But there's also this... this weird sense of relief. Like I'm finally letting it out after holding it in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4, I think. I feel... I feel drained, but also lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, James. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I think that's good. It's a lot to process, but... but I'm glad we did this. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up."
