    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was about 8 years old, playing in our backyard. It was a sunny day, and I remember the smell of freshly cut grass. I was alone, kicking a soccer ball around when I heard a growl. I turned and saw this large, brown dog. Its teeth were bared, and it was snarling at me. I froze, my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog started moving towards me slowly. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move. My legs felt like they were made of lead. I could hear my own breathing getting faster and louder. The dog was getting closer, and I could see the saliva dripping from its mouth. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the dog lunged at me. I tried to turn away, but it was too late. Its teeth sank into my arm, and I screamed. The pain was intense, burning and sharp at the same time. I could feel its hot breath on my skin, and the pressure of its jaw clamping down. I started hitting it with my other hand, crying and yelling for help.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: It felt like forever, but it was probably just a few seconds. My neighbor heard the commotion and came running. He managed to pull the dog off me, but I was already bleeding badly. I remember looking at my arm and seeing the torn flesh and blood. I felt dizzy and nauseous. The world seemed to be spinning around me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: My parents rushed me to the hospital. I needed stitches and had to get rabies shots. But the worst part was the fear. For months after, I couldn't go outside alone. I'd have nightmares about dogs chasing me. Even now, when I see a large dog, my heart starts racing, and I feel that same paralyzing fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I feel so angry. Why did it have to happen to me? Why couldn't I fight back? I feel weak and ashamed that this still affects me so much. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it. Every time I see a dog, I'm right back in that moment, feeling helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: The hardest part is how it's affected my life. I can't take my girlfriend's dog for walks. I avoid parks where dogs might be off-leash. It's embarrassing having to explain why I'm so scared. I feel like less of a man, you know? Like I should be over this by now. But every time I try to face it, that fear comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage by sharing this.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get past this. Will I always be the guy who's afraid of dogs? Will I ever be able to enjoy a simple walk in the park without constantly looking over my shoulder? I want to move on, but it feels like this experience has become a part of who I am. And I hate that. I hate feeling so vulnerable and out of control.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these feelings. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess... it's just hard. Every time I talk about it, it feels so real again. I can almost feel the dog's teeth, hear its growl. But at the same time, being able to talk about it without completely falling apart feels like a small victory. Maybe there's hope that one day, this won't have such a hold on me.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Honestly, I feel drained. Talking about it always takes a lot out of me. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief maybe? Like I've let out something that's been bottled up inside. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel a little shaky, but it's not as overwhelming as it used to be. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common reaction. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's still scary, and I'm not sure what the next step is, but I'm willing to keep trying. Is that enough for now?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've made significant progress today."
