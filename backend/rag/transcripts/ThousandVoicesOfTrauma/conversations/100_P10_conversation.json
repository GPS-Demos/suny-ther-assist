    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about police brutality brings up a lot of memories from when I was bullied. It's not exactly the same, but there's this feeling of powerlessness that connects them, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and bring yourself to the scene. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at a protest downtown. It's a warm day, probably mid-summer. There are so many people around me, holding signs, chanting. I can smell sweat and hear the buzz of the crowd. It feels... electric, but also tense.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything seems peaceful at first, but then... oh God, I see police officers starting to form a line. They're putting on riot gear. My heart is racing. I... I can't help but think of how I felt when I was cornered by bullies in school.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The crowd is getting agitated. People are shouting louder. I... I want to leave, but I'm stuck in the middle. Suddenly, there's a loud bang. Tear gas! People are screaming, running. I can't breathe... I...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's happening to you?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm being pushed and shoved. Someone elbows me in the ribs. I stumble and fall. The concrete is rough against my palms. I can taste the tear gas, it's burning my eyes, my throat. I'm coughing, struggling to get up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here in the room with me.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm on the ground, and I see boots approaching. A police officer grabs my arm roughly, yanking me up. I try to explain that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but he's not listening. He's twisting my arm behind my back. It hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Angry. Helpless. Just like when I was bullied. I can't defend myself. I can't make it stop. I'm being handcuffed, and it's too tight. My wrists are burning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're dragging me towards a police van. People around me are yelling, some are filming with their phones. I see a woman crying, being held back by her friends. I want to disappear. I feel so ashamed, even though I know I didn't do anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* They throw me into the van. It's dark, cold. I can hear others sobbing, cursing. My face is pressed against the metal floor. It smells like sweat and fear. I... I wet myself. Oh God, I'm so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're driving. It's rough, I'm being tossed around. Someone next to me is having a panic attack. I want to help them, but I can't move. My shoulders are aching from the position. I keep thinking about my partner, wondering if they know what's happened to me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel numb. Like I'm watching this happen to someone else. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common response. Stay present if you can. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. But I feel... hollow.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We arrive at the station. They pull us out roughly. My legs are weak, I stumble. An officer catches me, but not gently. He mutters something about \"troublemakers.\" I want to argue, to explain, but my voice is gone. I'm just... resigned.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens inside?",
    "Client: It's bright, harsh fluorescent lights. They take my fingerprints, my photo. I feel like a criminal. They ask me questions, but I can barely focus. My mind keeps flashing back to being cornered by bullies, feeling small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathes* They put me in a holding cell. It's crowded, uncomfortable. People are angry, scared. I curl up in a corner, trying to make myself invisible. Hours pass. I'm thirsty, exhausted. Finally, they release us with a warning. No charges, but the damage is done.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved, but also furious. Violated. I feel like my rights were trampled on. As I walk out, I see the same woman from earlier. She hugs me, crying. I realize she's been waiting all this time. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6. I'm starting to feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you describe how you feel physically?",
    "Client: My body aches. My wrists are bruised from the cuffs. My eyes still sting from the tear gas. I'm exhausted, but also wired. Like I can't relax. My heart is still racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I break down. As soon as I see my partner, I just... I can't hold it together anymore. I sob in their arms. I feel so vulnerable, so angry at the world. I want to shower, to wash it all away, but I'm too tired to move.",
    "Therapist: How does your partner react?",
    "Client: They're supportive, but I can see the shock in their eyes. They don't know what to say. I feel... I feel like I've brought this darkness into our home. I'm worried about how this will affect us.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 5. I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm... I'm here. In the room with you. It feels... it feels heavy, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter for having shared it?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... maybe a little proud? For getting through it? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a significant accomplishment.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I guess it is. It's still hard, but... maybe it's getting a little easier to talk about?",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Well done today, John.",
    "Client: Thanks... I... I think I need some water. And maybe a moment to just... breathe.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
