    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back at the compound. The air is thick with incense and chanting. I can see the leader, his eyes intense and piercing. My heart is racing already.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I can feel the tension in my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The leader is speaking now, his voice low and hypnotic. He's talking about sacrifice, about how we need to prove our devotion. I remember feeling confused, but also... drawn in. Like I couldn't look away.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's... he's asking for volunteers. I can see people around me getting excited, raising their hands. But I'm frozen. I want to run, but my feet won't move. The air feels so heavy, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm at a 9. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone pushes me forward. The leader is smiling at me, but it's not a kind smile. It's... predatory. I feel so small, so helpless. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm going to pass out. Can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Take some deep breaths. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... okay. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. My heart's still racing, but I don't feel as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Do you feel able to continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. It's hard, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's go back to the memory. What happens after you're pushed forward?",
    "Client: The leader... he puts his hand on my shoulder. It feels heavy, oppressive. He's telling me I've been chosen for a special purpose. Part of me feels special, but mostly I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 again. My stomach is churning, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He leads me to a small room. It's dark, lit only by candles. The smell of incense is overwhelming. I can hear chanting outside, but it sounds far away. I'm shaking, but I can't show it. I have to be strong, or... or...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to a 9. I feel like I'm suffocating. The walls are closing in.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Thanks. It's... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I can. The leader is talking about purification, about shedding our old selves. He has a knife. It glints in the candlelight. I'm terrified, but also... also feeling this weird sense of belonging. Like this is where I'm meant to be.",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. The fear is still there, but there's also this sense of release.",
