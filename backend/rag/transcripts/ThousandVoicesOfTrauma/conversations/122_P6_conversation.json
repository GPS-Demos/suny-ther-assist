    "Therapist: Alright, Raj, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my childhood home. It's late at night, and I can hear my parents arguing in the next room. Their voices are getting louder, and I'm curled up in my bed, trying to block out the sound with my pillow.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The shouting is getting worse. I can hear my mom crying now, and there's a loud crash \u2013 like something being thrown. My heart is racing, and I'm shaking. I want to help her, but I'm too scared to move.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I hear footsteps coming towards my room. I'm terrified it might be my dad, but it's my mom. She's sobbing and has a bruise on her face. She comes to my bed and hugs me tightly, telling me everything will be okay. But I know it's not true. I feel so helpless and angry.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed. My chest is tight, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* It's hard to stay with this memory. I keep wanting to open my eyes and escape it.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. Try to stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: My mom stays with me all night. We can hear my dad stomping around the house, slamming doors. Neither of us sleeps. I just lie there, feeling this mix of fear and anger. I wanted to protect her, but I was just a kid. I felt so... powerless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My hands are clenched, and I feel this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The next morning, everything seems normal on the surface. My dad acts like nothing happened, but my mom has this haunted look in her eyes. I go to school feeling exhausted and scared about what I might find when I get home. This cycle just keeps repeating, and I never know when the next explosion will happen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I feel sad more than anything.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My breathing has steadied, but I still feel tense. There's this heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As I got older, I started to intervene more. I'd try to distract my dad or get between them. Sometimes it worked, but other times it just made things worse. I remember one night when I was about 14, I actually pushed my dad away from my mom. He looked so shocked, and for a moment, I thought he might hit me too. But he just stormed out of the house.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. I'm feeling really angry remembering this. My jaw is clenched, and I can feel tension in my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: After that night, things changed. The physical violence stopped, but the emotional abuse continued. It was like living in a pressure cooker, never knowing when things would explode. I started staying out late, avoiding home as much as possible. I felt guilty for leaving my mom alone, but I couldn't stand being in that house.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6 now. I feel... I don't know, kind of numb? Like I'm disconnected from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's a common response. How do you feel about ending the exercise?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I'm ready to stop. It's... it's been intense.",
