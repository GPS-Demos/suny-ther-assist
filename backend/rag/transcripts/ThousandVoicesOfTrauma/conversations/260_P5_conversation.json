    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... not really sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've never done anything like this before. Can you explain what it involves?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit your trauma memory in a safe environment. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving those experiences. I've spent so long trying to forget them. Won't this make things worse? And... I'm not sure how my military combat experience relates to my childhood trauma. It feels like they're separate issues.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process can be challenging, but it's designed to help you process and heal. How do you think they might be connected?",
    "Client: I... I guess I never thought about it that way. Maybe the childhood stuff made me more vulnerable when I was in combat? It's just... both experiences feel so overwhelming. I'm scared of facing them head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. We'll go at your pace. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think... maybe just knowing that I can stop if it gets too much? And maybe some reassurance that this really does help? I've tried so many things, and nothing seems to make the nightmares and flashbacks go away.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You can pause anytime. This approach has helped many people with PTSD. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. But... can you walk me through what's going to happen? Like, step by step? I feel like I need to prepare myself mentally.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll start with a relaxation exercise, then you'll describe the memory. I'll guide you with questions. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds... manageable, I guess. Will I have to close my eyes? Sometimes when I do that, the memories feel too real, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Eyes open or closed is your choice. What would make you feel most comfortable?",
    "Client: I think... I'd prefer to keep them open, at least to start with. Maybe looking at something in the room to remind me where I am? Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Choose an object to focus on. Are you ready to start the relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm still nervous, but I'm trying to remind myself that this is supposed to help. Can we start with some deep breathing? That usually helps me calm down a little.",
    "Therapist: Great suggestion. Let's begin with deep breaths. Inhale slowly..."
