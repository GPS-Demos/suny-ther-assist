    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the bank, just a regular day. I was waiting in line when suddenly these men burst in with guns. They were shouting, telling everyone to get down. I froze. I couldn't move. My heart was racing so fast...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They made us all lie face down on the floor. I could hear people crying, whimpering. The men were yelling, threatening to shoot if anyone moved. I was shaking so badly, I thought they'd notice and... and... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I remember the cold floor against my cheek. The smell of fear and sweat. One of the men grabbed a woman near me, demanding to know who the manager was. She was sobbing, begging him not to hurt her. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: Hours passed, or maybe it just felt that way. My arms ached from being in the same position. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. Then there was commotion outside. The robbers started panicking. One of them grabbed me, yanked me up by my hair. He... he held the gun to my head, using me as a shield.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. I could feel the cold metal against my temple. My legs were weak, I thought I might collapse. The man was screaming at the police outside, but his words were just a blur. All I could focus on was the gun, and how my life might end at any second.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud bang. At first, I thought I'd been shot. But it was a flash grenade. Everything was chaos. The man holding me let go, and I fell to the ground. Someone grabbed me - a police officer - and dragged me to safety. I was crying, shaking uncontrollably. Even when they told me it was over, I couldn't stop trembling.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Shaky. My heart's racing again. But... I made it through telling you. I didn't think I could.",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* It's still so vivid. The fear, the helplessness. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back there, especially when I hear loud noises or see someone who looks like one of the robbers.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: Will it ever get better? Sometimes I feel like I'll never be the same person I was before this happened.",
    "Therapist: With time and work, it will improve. You're already showing strength.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... hard. I used to feel safe everywhere. Now, I'm constantly on edge, especially in public places. I've stopped going to the bank altogether. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long. But keeping it bottled up inside... it's been eating away at me.",
    "Therapist: Sharing is a big step. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I just want to feel normal again. To be able to go out without constantly looking over my shoulder or flinching at every loud noise. It's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: It is exhausting, but you're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's hard to see sometimes, but being able to talk about it today... that's something I couldn't have done a few months ago. It still hurts, but maybe it hurts a little less now.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy weight I've been carrying. It's still there, but I don't feel like I'm carrying it alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and for helping me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
