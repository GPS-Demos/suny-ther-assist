    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of the plane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screeching of metal, feel the violent shaking. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. It's like I'm back there, helpless, waiting for the impact. I keep thinking about how close I came to... to not making it. And the guilt. Oh god, the guilt. So many others didn't survive. Why me?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with some intense emotions. Can you tell me more about the guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. I see their faces, you know? The family sitting across from me. The flight attendant who helped me with my bag. They had lives, families, dreams. And in an instant, it was all gone. I survived, but at what cost? I feel like I don't deserve to be here sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's paralyzing. I struggle to enjoy anything without feeling this weight of survivor's guilt. I've been avoiding flying, obviously, but it's more than that. I find myself hesitating to make plans for the future, as if I don't have the right to move forward when others can't.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up when you allow yourself to consider the future?",
    "Client: I... I feel conflicted. Part of me wants to live fully, to honor those who didn't make it by embracing life. But then there's this voice that says I'm betraying them somehow. It's like I'm stuck between two worlds - the one where I died on that plane and the one where I survived. I don't know how to reconcile them.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you share these thoughts?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel like I can't get a full breath. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. What do you notice as you focus on your breath?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to focus. My mind keeps drifting back to the crash. But... okay, I'm trying. I notice my breath is shallow. As I try to deepen it, I feel some of the tension in my chest easing. It's like... like I'm finally letting go of a breath I've been holding since the crash.",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up as you experience that release?",
    "Client: Sadness, I think. But also... relief? It's like I've been holding onto this tension as a way of... I don't know, punishing myself maybe? Or staying connected to the event? Letting it go feels both freeing and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on why it feels terrifying?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm afraid that if I let go of this pain, this constant state of anxiety, I'll forget. I'll forget the crash, the people who died, the enormity of what happened. And that feels like a betrayal. But at the same time, living like this... it's exhausting. I'm so tired of being afraid all the time.",
    "Therapist: How might remembering differ from constantly reliving?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. Remembering... that feels more like honoring their memory. Reliving is just... torture. For me and for my family. They've been so patient, but I know my anxiety affects them too. Maybe... maybe there's a way to remember without letting it consume me?",
    "Therapist: What would that look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it means allowing myself to feel joy again without guilt. To make plans for the future while also taking time to remember those who were lost. To use this second chance at life to do something meaningful, something that might make a difference in the world.",
    "Therapist: How does that perspective feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. There's a lightness in my chest that wasn't there before. Like a glimmer of hope. But there's also fear. What if I can't do it? What if I let everyone down - the survivors, the ones who died, my family?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to try?",
    "Client: To try... I suppose it would mean taking a step forward, however small. Maybe it's as simple as booking a short flight, or volunteering at a crisis center. It's scary to think about, but... but also exciting? Like I'm finally allowing myself to see a future beyond the crash.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift in perspective relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I think it's a turning point. For so long, I've been stuck in that moment, in that plane. But now... now I can see that there might be a way forward. It doesn't mean forgetting or dismissing what happened. It means... it means integrating it into my life in a way that allows me to keep living, to keep growing.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed, but in a different way than before. It's like... like I've been carrying this heavy backpack, and I've just realized I can take it off sometimes. I don't have to carry the weight of the crash every moment of every day. There's sadness, and fear, but also... hope. I think I feel hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that it's okay to move forward. That doing so doesn't mean I'm forgetting or betraying anyone. I want to remember this feeling of hope, however small it might be. And I want to remember that I'm not alone in this journey. That it's okay to lean on others, to ask for help when the weight gets too heavy.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful takeaways. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment of silence. To honor those who were lost, but also to acknowledge my own survival and the journey ahead. And then... and then maybe we could talk about some small steps I could take this week towards reclaiming my life. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that."
