    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the car accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from university. It was raining heavily, and I was tired after a long day of classes. The roads were slippery, and visibility was poor. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to focus on the road ahead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As I approached an intersection, I saw the traffic light turn yellow. I thought I could make it, so I sped up a little. But then, out of nowhere, a car from the left side... it just appeared. I tried to brake, but the car kept sliding. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe. The sound of screeching tires and metal crushing... it was deafening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the burning rubber. My body tensed up, bracing for impact. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. It felt like being punched. I tasted blood in my mouth. Everything was spinning, and I couldn't make sense of what was happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the initial impact, there was this eerie silence. I was disoriented, my ears were ringing. I could hear muffled voices outside, people shouting. I tried to move, but my body felt heavy. I was scared... so scared. What if I was seriously injured? What if I had hurt someone else?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember the paramedics arriving. They were asking me questions, but I couldn't focus. My mind kept replaying the accident over and over. I felt so guilty and ashamed. I should have been more careful. I kept thinking about my parents, how disappointed they would be.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling anxious. My heart is racing, just like it did that day. I can feel the tension in my shoulders and chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep seeing flashes of the accident in my mind.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: It's just... every time I get into a car now, I feel this overwhelming fear. I can't help but think it might happen again. I've been avoiding driving as much as possible. Even as a passenger, I'm constantly on edge, watching for potential dangers.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part is the nightmares. Almost every night, I relive the accident in my dreams. Sometimes it's exactly as it happened, other times it's worse. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I can't escape it. It's affecting my studies too. I can't concentrate in class because I'm always thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How else has it impacted you?",
    "Client: I've become more withdrawn. I used to enjoy going out with friends, but now I make excuses to stay in. I'm always worried something bad might happen. My anxiety has gotten worse, and I find myself overthinking every little decision. It's like I've lost confidence in myself and my ability to handle situations.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing a difficult experience.",
    "Client: Sometimes I feel so angry at myself. Why did I have to speed up at that yellow light? Why couldn't I have been more careful? And then I feel guilty for being angry. It's this constant cycle of emotions that I can't seem to break free from.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job expressing these feelings.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know I need to. I want to get better. I want to be able to drive again without panic. I want to enjoy life like I used to. But right now, it feels like this accident has taken over everything. I'm tired of feeling this way, but I don't know how to move past it.",
    "Therapist: Your desire to improve is a strength. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be the guy who panics at the sight of a yellow traffic light? Will I ever be able to enjoy a car ride without constantly scanning for danger? I miss the person I was before the accident.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit drained, to be honest. Talking about it brings up all these emotions, but... I also feel a tiny bit lighter. Like maybe, just maybe, there's hope that I can work through this. It's still overwhelming, but being able to talk about it without completely falling apart feels like a small step forward.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. We'll end here for today."
