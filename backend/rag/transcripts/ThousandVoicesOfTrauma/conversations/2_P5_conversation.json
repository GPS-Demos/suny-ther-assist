    "Therapist: Hello Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Anderson. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of talking about the plane crash... it's just so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel anxious. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: It's just... every time I think about that day, my heart starts racing. I can feel the panic rising in my chest. I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories, and now you're asking me to face them head-on. It feels like I'm being thrown back into that terrifying moment.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Today, we'll work through this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But... what exactly are we going to do? I'm not sure I can handle reliving the entire experience.",
    "Therapist: We'll do an imaginal exposure. It helps process the trauma. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I'm still not sure I can do this. What if I have a panic attack or completely break down?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a bit reassuring, I guess. But what if the memories become too intense? I've worked so hard to keep them at bay all these years. I'm afraid of losing control.",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Your safety is my priority. Any questions?",
    "Client: Well, yes. How long will this take? And will I have to do this multiple times? The thought of repeatedly revisiting this trauma is... it's frightening.",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about an hour. We'll likely do this a few times. Gradual exposure helps.",
    "Client: I see. It's a lot to take in. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Anderson. I know I'm not the easiest patient. It's just... after the crash, and then losing my husband a few years later, I've felt so alone. This depression... it's like a heavy blanket I can't shake off.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. This process can help lift that weight. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still scared, but I trust you. And if this can help me finally move past this trauma and maybe even help with my depression, then I'm willing to try. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your courage is commendable. Let's begin when you're ready."
