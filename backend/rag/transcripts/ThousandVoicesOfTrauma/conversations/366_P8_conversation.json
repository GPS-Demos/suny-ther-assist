    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm back there again, you know? I can still hear the wind howling, feel the house shaking. My heart's racing a bit. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear. Terror. I remember feeling so helpless, like nature was just going to swallow us whole. The roof was creaking, and I thought, \"This is it. We're not going to make it.\" I can feel that same panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Where in your body do you feel that panic?",
    "Client: It's... it's right here in the center of my chest. Like a tight knot. And my shoulders are so tense, I didn't even realize until now. It's like I'm bracing for impact all over again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unprepared we were. We should've known better, should've left earlier. And then I feel guilty because we made it out okay, but our neighbors... they lost everything. Why us? Why were we spared when others weren't? It doesn't make sense, and I can't shake this feeling that maybe we don't deserve to be okay.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you in your daily life now?",
    "Client: They... they haunt me. Every time there's a storm forecast, I'm on edge. I've become obsessed with emergency preparedness. I've got go-bags packed for everyone in the family, even though they think I'm overreacting. And I feel so disconnected from people who haven't been through something like this. How can they understand? How can they just go about their lives like the world isn't going to come crashing down at any moment?",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your anxiety levels as you share this?",
    "Client: It's... fluctuating. When I talk about the actual event, it spikes. But discussing how it affects me now, it's more of a constant hum. It's always there, you know? Like background noise I can't quite tune out. But right now, talking about it... it's like turning up the volume on that noise.",
    "Therapist: Can you identify any positive changes or growth since the disaster?",
    "Client: Positive changes? I... I guess I've become more aware of what really matters. Material things seem so insignificant now. And I've grown closer to my family. We went through this together, and it's like we have this unspoken understanding. Oh, and I've gotten involved in local disaster relief efforts. It helps to feel like I'm doing something, you know? Like I'm not just a victim, but someone who can help others who are going through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: How does helping others impact your own healing process?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. On one hand, it gives me purpose. I feel like I'm turning this awful experience into something meaningful. But sometimes, it brings everything back. I'll be helping someone and suddenly I'm right back in the middle of our disaster. It's like... like I'm reliving it all over again. But then I remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm making a difference. It's a rollercoaster, really.",
    "Therapist: What strategies help you manage when those memories resurface?",
    "Client: I've been trying that grounding technique you taught me. Focusing on my senses, you know? I'll touch something solid, like a table, and really concentrate on how it feels. Or I'll list things I can see in the room. It helps bring me back to the present. And deep breathing... I was skeptical at first, but it really does help calm me down. Oh, and talking to my daughter. She has this way of making me laugh, even when I'm in a dark place. It reminds me that there's still joy in the world.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in therapy so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to gauge sometimes. There are days when I feel like I've made huge strides, like I'm finally getting my life back. And then there are days when it all comes crashing down again, and I wonder if I've made any progress at all. But overall, I think I'm moving forward. I'm sleeping better most nights. I can talk about the disaster without completely falling apart now. And I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I'll be okay. It's slow, and it's not linear, but I think I'm getting there.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to work more on managing those sudden anxiety spikes. You know, when something triggers a memory and I feel like I'm right back in the middle of the disaster. I want to be able to recognize them coming and have more tools to handle them. Because right now, they still catch me off guard and it's... it's exhausting. I want to feel more in control, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. We'll definitely address that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, honestly. Talking about all of this is draining. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've unpacked a heavy bag I've been carrying around. My chest feels a bit lighter. I'm still anxious, but it's not as overwhelming as it was at the beginning of the session. It's more manageable now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to be kind to yourself this week.",
    "Client: I'll try. It's not easy, but I'm working on it. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know we still have a long way to go, but I'm grateful for the progress we've made so far.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll pick up here next week."
