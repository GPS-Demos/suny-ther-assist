    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is shaking on the inside, but I'm frozen on the outside. That memory of the hostage situation, it's so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about my coworker who didn't make it out. I was right there, you know? I could have... maybe I should have done something more. It's like I'm back in that moment, feeling so helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight in my chest. I feel sick to my stomach when I think about it. Sometimes I have these intrusive thoughts, imagining what would have happened if I had acted differently. It's exhausting, constantly replaying those moments in my head.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my throat. It's hard to swallow. I feel a bit dizzy, too. It's like my body is still in fight-or-flight mode, even though I'm sitting here safe in your office. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I should have been braver. I should have done more.\" But then another part of me says, \"You did what you could. You were just trying to survive.\" It's like there's a constant argument in my head. And then I think about my family, how close I came to never seeing them again. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your overall experience of the trauma?",
    "Client: I guess... they're all tied to this feeling of powerlessness. During the hostage situation, I felt completely out of control. And now, even though it's over, I still feel like I don't have control over my own thoughts and feelings. It's frustrating and scary.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, but I know that's not helpful. I think I need... reassurance? That it's okay to feel this way, that I'm not going crazy. And maybe some hope that it won't always be this intense.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid needs. How can we address them?",
    "Client: Maybe... can we talk about some coping strategies? Something to ground me when these memories and feelings become overwhelming? And... I think I need to hear that it's okay to forgive myself. That's something I'm really struggling with.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's explore that. What does self-forgiveness mean to you?",
    "Client: That's a tough one. I suppose it means... accepting that I did the best I could in an impossible situation. Recognizing that I'm human, with limitations, and that doesn't make me a bad person. But it's so hard to do that when I think about what happened.",
    "Therapist: How might working towards self-forgiveness impact your healing?",
    "Client: I think... it might help me move forward. Maybe I'd be able to think about the incident without feeling this crushing guilt. I could focus more on healing and less on punishing myself. But it feels like such a long way off right now.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards self-forgiveness?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could start by acknowledging one thing each day that I did right during the hostage situation. Even if it's something small, like staying calm for a moment or comforting someone else. It's hard to think about, but maybe it would help balance out all the negative thoughts.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It's... scary, honestly. Part of me feels like I don't deserve to focus on the positive things. But another part feels a tiny bit of relief, like maybe there's a way out of this cycle of guilt and fear. It's a glimmer of hope, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we talk?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has changed me. I used to be so carefree, you know? Now I'm always on edge, always looking for potential threats. But talking about it like this... it's hard, but it's also making me feel less alone. Like maybe I can learn to live with this, even if I can't forget it.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet. I'm sad for the person I used to be, but I'm also starting to see that maybe I can grow from this. Maybe I can be strong in a different way now. It's not what I would have chosen, but... I'm still here. I survived. And maybe that's something to build on.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered through this process?",
    "Client: I... I guess I've found out that I'm more resilient than I thought. I'm still here, still fighting to get better. And I've learned to be more compassionate, both to others and, slowly, to myself. It's like this experience has given me a deeper understanding of what people go through.",
    "Therapist: How might you use those strengths moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could use my experience to help others who've been through trauma. Not right now, but someday. And in my daily life, I could try to be more patient with myself and others. To remember that everyone's fighting their own battles, even if they're not visible.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if it's just for a moment. There's still so much to work through, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier right now. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on those coping strategies we mentioned. And maybe explore more about self-forgiveness. It feels important, even if it's scary. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll continue at your pace. How would you like to close today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit quietly for a moment? I need some time to process everything we've talked about. And maybe... could you remind me that it's okay to feel whatever I'm feeling?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Let's take that moment now. Remember, your feelings are valid and an important part of your healing journey."
