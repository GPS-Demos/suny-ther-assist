    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of my ex-husband telling me he wanted a divorce... it brought up so many emotions. I felt like I was right back there in our kitchen, hearing those words all over again. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's strange how vivid it all still is, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: I think... the overwhelming sense of betrayal. I mean, we'd been together for 25 years, and suddenly it was all over. I remember feeling like the ground was crumbling beneath my feet. And there was this voice in my head, you know? It kept saying, \"You should have seen this coming. You weren't good enough.\" I've carried that feeling with me for so long.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that moment today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But also, different somehow. I noticed that while I still felt those painful emotions, they didn't completely overwhelm me like they used to. There was a part of me that could observe what was happening, if that makes sense? It's like... I'm starting to see that memory as just one part of my life, not my entire identity.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've been working on not letting my past define me, right? And I think today showed me that I'm making progress. I mean, don't get me wrong, it still hurts. But I'm starting to see that I'm more than just a divorced woman or someone who wasn't \"good enough.\" I'm a professional, a mother, a friend... I have value beyond that relationship.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable insight. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized that a lot of my anxiety in new relationships stems from this fear of abandonment. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? But going through this exposure... it's helping me see that not every relationship will end the same way. I think I'm starting to trust myself more, to believe that I can handle whatever comes my way.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this awareness moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to be more mindful of when I'm projecting my past fears onto current situations. Maybe I can start challenging those negative thoughts when they come up. And... I think I need to give myself more credit. I've been through a lot, but I'm still here, still growing. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think it's that my emotions, even the painful ones, don't have to control me. I can acknowledge them without being consumed by them. And... that I'm stronger than I often give myself credit for. This process isn't easy, but I'm doing it. And that means something.",
    "Therapist: Well said. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. They're tough, no doubt about it. But I can see how they're helping me process things I've avoided for years. It's like... I'm finally unpacking this heavy suitcase I've been lugging around. It's uncomfortable, but I also feel lighter after each session. So yeah, I'm willing to keep going. I want to see where this journey takes me.",
    "Therapist: That's great, Sarah. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I'm feeling pretty drained, to be honest. But also... kind of proud? Is that weird? I mean, I know we're just talking, but it feels like I'm doing something really important for myself. I just hope I can keep this momentum going outside of our sessions.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal feeling. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps me feel grounded. And then maybe I'll call my daughter. She's been so supportive throughout this process, and I know talking to her will help me feel connected. Oh, and I'll definitely do some journaling before bed. It helps me process everything we discuss here.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know I say this a lot, but I really appreciate your guidance through all of this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for still struggling with this after so many years. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Sarah. You're doing great work."
