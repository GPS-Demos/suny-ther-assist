    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memory of being in that small, dark cell... it's like I was right back there again. I could almost smell the damp concrete and feel the cold seeping into my bones.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (sighs) Fear. Intense fear. But also... anger. I'm angry that they took away my freedom, my dignity. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, how I couldn't protect myself from... from what happened. It's like I'm reliving those moments of terror and shame all over again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my stomach. My fists are clenched, and I want to scream. But at the same time, I feel this heaviness, like I'm being crushed by the weight of it all. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? I was just trying to stand up for what's right, and they... they treated me like I wasn't even human. I feel so... damaged. Like I'll never be whole again. And then I feel guilty for feeling this way because I know others had it worse. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I... I'm scared that I'll never feel safe again. Even now, years later, I still jump at sudden noises. I have trouble trusting people, even my own family sometimes. It's like a part of me is still trapped in that cell, waiting for the next... the next assault. I hate that they still have this power over me.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me feels vulnerable, exposed. But there's also a sense of... relief? Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. My shoulders feel a bit lighter. But I'm also afraid... afraid that by talking about it, I'm making it real again.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that fear?",
    "Client: I've spent so long trying to forget, to push it all down. Talking about it feels like... like I'm opening Pandora's box. What if I can't close it again? What if the nightmares get worse? But then... another part of me wonders if maybe this is how I finally start to heal. It's terrifying and... and maybe a little hopeful at the same time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. The idea of healing feels so distant, almost impossible. But hearing you say that... it makes me wonder. Could I really move past this? I've been carrying this weight for so long, I'm not sure I know who I am without it. But God, I'm so tired of being afraid all the time. I want to feel whole again, to trust again. I want to be able to hug my grandchildren without flinching. Maybe... maybe this is the first step?",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous perspective. What's that like for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also... exciting? Like I'm standing on the edge of something big. I've spent so long just surviving, the idea of actually living again is... overwhelming. But in a good way, I think. It's like I can see a tiny glimmer of light at the end of this long, dark tunnel I've been in. I'm not sure I believe I can reach it yet, but... but maybe it's possible?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you consider this?",
    "Client: I... I notice my breathing has slowed down. The tightness in my chest isn't as bad. My hands are unclenched, and I feel... lighter? Not completely, but... it's like a small weight has been lifted. I still feel shaky, but there's a warmth in my chest that wasn't there before. It's... it's nice.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What do you want to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I want to explore this idea of healing more. It's scary, but I'm tired of letting fear control my life. Maybe we could talk about ways to... to reclaim some of what was taken from me? I don't know if it's possible, but I want to try. I want to learn how to feel safe again, how to trust. I want to be able to look in the mirror and see more than just a victim. Is that... is that something we can work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to start?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... maybe we could start small? Like, finding ways to feel more grounded when the memories hit? Or... or maybe techniques to help me sleep better? The nightmares are still so bad sometimes. And... and I think I want to work on connecting with my family more. They've been so patient, but I know my trauma has affected them too. I want to be present for them, to be the wife and mother and grandmother they deserve. Is that... is that too much?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Those are great goals. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think I'm ready. It's scary, but... but I want to do this. For myself, for my family. I want to reclaim my life. I know it won't be easy, and I'm sure there will be setbacks, but... but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's hope. Thank you for... for helping me see that. I'm nervous, but I'm ready to take this next step.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How do you want to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this new feeling of possibility. And maybe... maybe we could end with something positive? Could you remind me of something I've accomplished in our sessions so far? I think I need to hear that right now, to believe that progress is possible. And then... then I think I'll be ready to face the world again, knowing I have this safe space to return to. Is that okay?"
