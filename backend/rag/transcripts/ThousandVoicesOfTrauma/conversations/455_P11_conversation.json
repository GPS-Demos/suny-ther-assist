    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's been years since I've allowed myself to really think about those times with my ex-husband. The shouting, the constant fear... it's all so vivid now. I can still hear the sound of his footsteps coming up the stairs, and I remember how my heart would race, wondering what mood he'd be in.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you during this experience?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. I was so young when we married, barely 20. I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and in our culture, divorce was... well, it wasn't something we talked about. I remember one particular night when he came home late, smelling of alcohol. He was angry about something at work, and I became his target. I can still feel the sting on my cheek where he... (pauses, takes a deep breath) where he slapped me.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. But also, in a strange way, empowering. I survived that. I'm here now, safe in my own home. I've built a life for myself. It's not perfect, but it's mine. I just wish I could shake this constant anxiety, you know? Even after all these years, I still jump at loud noises, and I have trouble trusting people.",
    "Therapist: How do you see that connecting to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Oh, I see it so clearly now. The hypervigilance, the nightmares, the way I isolate myself... it all stems from those years of abuse. I've spent so long trying to forget, but maybe that's been part of the problem. Facing it head-on like this, it's terrifying, but I think it might be necessary.",
    "Therapist: What insights have you gained from this process?",
    "Client: I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived years of abuse, I managed to leave that situation, and I've been taking care of myself ever since. But I've also realized how much that experience still affects me. The anxiety, the trust issues... they're not just part of who I am. They're responses to trauma, and maybe... maybe I can work on changing them.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I also feel... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way to live without this constant fear. I want to keep going. I want to understand myself better and learn how to manage these feelings. It's not easy, reliving these memories, but if it helps me move forward, I'm willing to do the work.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been surprisingly effective. When I feel myself getting overwhelmed, taking those deep breaths helps ground me. And writing in my journal after our sessions... it's painful, but it helps me process everything we've talked about. I've also been trying to be more social, just small steps like having tea with my neighbor. It's hard, but I think it's good for me.",
    "Therapist: How can we support your continued progress?",
    "Client: I think... I need reminders that it's okay to feel whatever I'm feeling. Sometimes I get frustrated with myself for not 'getting over it' faster. And maybe we could work more on those grounding techniques? They've been really helpful when the memories become too intense. Also, I'd like to explore ways to build trust again. I miss having close relationships, but I'm so afraid of being hurt.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Shall we set goals for next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. Maybe we could focus on more trust-building exercises? And I'd like to try another imaginal exposure, if you think I'm ready. It's difficult, but I can see how it's helping. I want to keep moving forward, even if it's scary. I've spent too many years letting fear control my life. I'm ready for a change.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll work on that next session."
