    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is screaming to run out that door. It's like my body knows what's coming and it's trying to protect me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day in Afghanistan. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in the Humvee. It's hot, so damn hot. The air is thick with dust, and I can taste it on my tongue. We're on patrol, moving slowly down this narrow street. Buildings on both sides, windows like dark eyes watching us. My hands are sweaty on my rifle.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: We're approaching an intersection. Something feels off. Too quiet. I'm scanning rooftops, doorways... wait. There's movement. A flash of metal in a window. I yell, \"Contact front!\" and then... oh God...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, James. You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The world explodes. An IED, right under us. The Humvee lifts, twists. I'm thrown against the roof, then slammed down. Can't breathe. Ears ringing. Smoke everywhere. I taste blood.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to move. My leg's pinned. I hear screaming. Is it me? No... it's Williams. He's in the back. I can't see him, but God, those screams...",
    "Therapist: Stay present, James. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: Gunfire. They're shooting at us. I'm fumbling for my rifle, but my arms feel like lead. I see Martinez dragging himself out. His face is covered in blood. He's yelling something, but I can't hear him over the ringing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. I... I can't move fast enough. Every second feels like an eternity. I need to help them, but I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally get my leg free. The pain hits me, but there's no time. I crawl out, dragging my rifle. The heat from the burning Humvee is intense. I see bodies on the ground. Are they ours? The enemy's? I can't tell.",
    "Therapist: What happens next, James?",
    "Client: I... I take cover behind the wreckage. My training kicks in. I start returning fire, but my hands are shaking so bad. I see Martinez. He's not moving. I want to check on him, but the gunfire is too heavy.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I'm calling for backup on the radio, but it's damaged. I don't know if it's getting through. I hear more explosions nearby. Are they hitting other units? I don't know how long we can hold out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Continue.",
    "Client: Time... time gets weird. It feels like hours, but it's probably just minutes. I'm low on ammo. I see movement, fire off a burst. Did I hit them? I don't know. The smoke is so thick now, I can barely see.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die here. In this hellhole, thousands of miles from home. I think about my mom, how she'll get the news. I'm angry. So angry at everything. Why am I even here?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, James. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear choppers. Finally, backup. But as they approach, the enemy fire intensifies. They're trying to take down the helicopters. I'm shooting, providing cover, but my rifle jams. I'm frantically trying to clear it.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense it hurts. My jaw is clenched, my fingers are cramping. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The choppers are landing now. Soldiers pour out, returning fire. They're running towards us. I see a medic heading for Williams, but... but I know it's too late. His screams stopped a while ago.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: Relief... guilt... anger. Why didn't they come sooner? Why couldn't I do more? I'm being pulled to my feet by someone. My leg buckles. The pain hits me like a truck now that the adrenaline is fading.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're loading us onto the chopper. I can see the burning Humvee, the bodies. I'm trying to count... who made it? Who didn't? The chopper lifts off, and I feel... I don't know. Empty. Like I left part of myself down there.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb. Just... numb. The noise of the chopper, the medics working on us, it all seems far away. I'm staring at my hands. They're covered in blood and dirt. Are they even mine? They don't feel like mine.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling, James. What happens next?",
    "Client: We land at the base. It's chaos. Doctors and nurses everywhere. I'm on a stretcher now, being rushed inside. Bright lights, voices shouting. Someone's cutting away my uniform. I want to tell them to stop, but I can't speak.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep seeing their faces. Williams, Martinez... the others. Did I do enough? Could I have saved them? It's my fault. I should have seen the IED. I should have...",
    "Therapist: James, remember, you're here now. You're safe. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... I'm in the hospital now. Days have passed, I think. My leg is in a cast. They tell me I'm lucky. Lucky? How can they say that? I'm alive, but at what cost?",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Guilt. So much guilt. And anger. I'm angry at everyone. The doctors, the other patients who are smiling and joking. Don't they know what happened? Don't they care?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions, James. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I'm back there. The explosion, the screams, the gunfire. I wake up shouting, covered in sweat. The nurses try to comfort me, but they don't understand. How could they?",
    "Therapist: How does this affect you now?",
    "Client: It... it never really leaves me. Even now, years later, I can still smell the smoke, taste the dust. Loud noises make me jump. I feel on edge all the time, like I'm waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. We're almost done. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a little lighter? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now... now someone else knows.",
    "Therapist: That's good, James. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Well done, James. You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... maybe a little proud too? I didn't think I could do this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. This was a big step. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. (Takes another deep breath) Thank you... for listening. For not judging.",
    "Therapist: That's what I'm here for, James. We'll continue to work through this together. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I'll be here.",
    "Therapist: Great job today, James. Take care of yourself this week."
