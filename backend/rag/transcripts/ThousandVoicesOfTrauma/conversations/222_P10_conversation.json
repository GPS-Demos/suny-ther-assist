    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit jittery, to be honest. I didn't sleep well last night thinking about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night of the home invasion. Describe what's happening in the present tense.",
    "Client: Okay... um... I'm in my bedroom. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm studying for my biology exam, feeling stressed about it. The house is quiet; my parents are already asleep. I hear a noise downstairs, like... like glass breaking. At first, I think maybe the cat knocked something over, but then I hear footsteps. Heavy footsteps. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh... probably a 5 or 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I... I get up from my desk. My hands are shaking as I reach for my phone. I'm trying to be quiet, but I'm breathing so hard. I can hear them moving around downstairs. There's more than one person. I'm frozen, unsure if I should hide or try to wake my parents. God, I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I decide to try and wake my parents. I tiptoe to my door, my heart pounding in my ears. As I open it, the floorboard creaks. Loud. Too loud. Everything goes silent downstairs. They heard me. Oh god, they heard me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're safe here. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... So, I hear them coming up the stairs. Fast. I panic and run to my parents' room. I'm shaking my dad awake, whispering urgently, \"Someone's in the house!\" He jumps up, tells me to wake mom and call 911. I can hear the intruders on the landing now. My mom's awake, confused. I'm fumbling with my phone, trying to dial, but my fingers won't work right.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The door bursts open. There are two men, both wearing masks. One has a gun. My dad yells at them to get out, tries to look brave, but I can see the fear in his eyes. The man with the gun points it at us, demands money and valuables. I can't stop shaking. Mom's crying silently. I feel so helpless, so violated. This is our home, our safe place, and they've destroyed that.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking this can't be real. It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from. I'm terrified they're going to hurt us. I feel guilty for not locking the doors properly. Maybe if I had, this wouldn't be happening.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it's not your fault. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They... they make us go downstairs. The one without the gun is ransacking the house, pulling out drawers, breaking things. The other one keeps the gun on us. We're huddled on the couch. I can smell their sweat, hear their heavy breathing. It's so visceral, so real. I keep thinking about all the stories I've heard about home invasions gone wrong. What if they decide to... to hurt us? What if...",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment, Sarah. What's happening right now?",
    "Client: Right... um... Dad's trying to reason with them, telling them where the safe is. His voice is shaking. I've never heard him sound so scared before. The guy with the gun seems jumpy, keeps looking out the window. I'm worried he might accidentally fire the gun. Every time he moves, I flinch. My mom's holding my hand so tight it hurts, but I don't want her to let go.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel nauseous, and my hands are clammy. It's hard to breathe, like there's a weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: Okay... okay, that helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The guy without the gun comes back with dad's watch collection and mom's jewelry box. They're arguing about whether it's enough. The one with the gun is getting more agitated. He starts yelling, demanding to know if we have more valuables. I can't stop staring at the gun. It's all I can focus on. Then, suddenly, we hear sirens in the distance. Everything happens so fast after that.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The guys panic. The one with the gun swears loudly. They start running for the back door. As they're leaving, the gunman turns and fires a shot. It hits the wall above our heads. The sound is deafening. I feel the impact in my chest. For a second, I think I've been hit. But then they're gone, and we're left in the silence, broken only by mom's sobs and the approaching sirens.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frightening. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe now. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A little better. Maybe down to a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's continue. What happens after the intruders leave?",
    "Client: We... we just sit there, frozen. I think we're all in shock. The police arrive a few minutes later. They sweep the house, but the men are long gone. An officer starts asking us questions, but I can barely focus. I keep replaying the sound of the gunshot in my head. My ears are ringing. I feel disconnected, like I'm watching everything happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. How long does this feeling last?",
    "Client: It... it feels like forever. The police are there for hours. They dust for fingerprints, take our statements. I can't stop shaking. Mom makes tea, but I can't drink it. My stomach is in knots. When they finally leave, none of us know what to do. We just sit in the living room, staring at the mess. The sun starts to come up, and it feels surreal. Like, how can the world just go on like normal after what happened?",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal reaction. What happens in the days following?",
    "Client: I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the men, hear the gunshot. I jump at every little noise. I can't focus on my studies. I feel... I feel broken. Like something fundamental has changed, and I don't know how to fix it. I'm angry, too. Angry at the men, angry at myself for not doing more, angry at the world for letting this happen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. How are you feeling now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart's still racing, and I feel anxious. But... I don't know, maybe a little relieved too? Like, saying it out loud makes it feel more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Maybe a 6? It's coming down.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... (deep breaths)... That helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it was good. I feel drained, but also like a weight has lifted a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. Do you have any questions?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. We'll continue working on this in our next session. Take care."
