    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Let's begin today's imaginal exposure session. How are you feeling about revisiting the domestic violence incident?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is screaming to run away. My hands are already getting clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, probably a 6 out of 10. My heart's already racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright... I'm... I'm in our old house. It's evening, and I can hear the TV in the background. Dad's been drinking again. I'm... I'm 12 years old, sitting at the kitchen table, trying to finish my homework before he notices me.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, smell?",
    "Client: The kitchen light is flickering... it always did that. I can smell the lasagna Mom made earlier. But there's also... the scent of beer. *voice trembles* I hear Dad's footsteps... they're getting louder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he stumbles into the kitchen. His eyes are bloodshot, and he's swaying a bit. He looks at me and... and his face just twists with anger. \"Why the hell aren't you in bed?\" he shouts. I flinch, knocking my pencil to the floor.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My stomach feels like it's tied in knots. I want to run, but I'm frozen. *breathing quickens* He's coming closer...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* It's... it's an 8 now. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I try to explain that I'm finishing homework, but he doesn't care. He grabs my arm, yanking me out of the chair. It hurts so much... I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. *voice breaks* I'm begging him to stop, but he's dragging me towards the living room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst. I feel sick... like I might throw up. My legs are shaking... I can barely stand.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he throws me onto the couch. I can smell the alcohol on his breath as he leans in close, screaming at me. I'm crying... trying to make myself as small as possible. Then... then I hear Mom's voice. She's pleading with him to stop.",
    "Therapist: How does hearing your mom affect you?",
    "Client: I feel... relieved for a second, but then... *chokes up* then I'm more scared. Because I know what's coming next.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Dad turns on her... starts yelling about how she's always defending me. He... he backhands her across the face. *sobs* There's blood... from her lip. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. *breathing heavily* I can't... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're stronger than you realize. Take a deep breath and ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still here. *pause* Dad's... he's grabbing Mom by the hair, dragging her to the kitchen. I can hear plates shattering... her crying out in pain. I'm... I'm curled up on the couch, hands over my ears, trying to block it all out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you telling yourself?",
    "Client: That... that it's all my fault. If I'd just gone to bed... if I wasn't so stupid... *voice cracks* Maybe he wouldn't be hurting Mom.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. You were a child. How long does this continue?",
    "Client: It feels like forever... but probably only a few minutes. Then... then I hear sirens. Someone must have called the police. Dad... he panics. Lets go of Mom and stumbles out the back door.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel hearing those sirens?",
    "Client: Relieved... but also terrified. What if they take Mom away? What if Dad comes back angrier? I... I don't move from the couch. I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens when the police arrive?",
    "Client: They... they come in. One officer goes to check on Mom in the kitchen. Another one approaches me. He's talking softly, asking if I'm hurt. I can't speak... I just shake my head. *sniffles* He puts a blanket around my shoulders. It's... it's the first time I feel safe in hours.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My muscles are so tense they ache. But... but there's a small sense of relief. Like... like maybe things will change now.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. Still high, but... but I made it through.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. Take some deep breaths. When you're ready, open your eyes and come back to the room.",
    "Client: *opens eyes, looks around* Wow... that was... intense. I didn't think I could do it.",
    "Therapist: But you did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained... but also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like... like I faced something I've been running from for years.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you did. You showed incredible courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you... I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about that night in so much detail. It's always been this... this blur of fear and pain.",
    "Therapist: Revisiting trauma is never easy, but you've taken a significant step in processing it. How do you think this experience might impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure yet. But maybe... maybe I'll feel less controlled by these memories? Like they're just part of my past, not something that defines me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Remember, healing is a process. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: Still a bit shaky, but... but my breathing's steadier. The knot in my stomach is loosening a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end the session. Place your feet firmly on the floor and focus on five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the bookshelf, the clock, and... and my own hands.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my jeans, the smooth surface of my watch, and... the softness of my shirt.",
    "Therapist: Great. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, a car passing outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of coffee and... maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... just the dryness in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: More... more present. Less caught up in the memories. My SUDS is probably down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. You've done incredibly hard work today. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But I think I need to do this. I want to stop letting these memories control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. We'll take it one step at a time. For now, what self-care activities do you have planned for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll go for a long walk. Maybe call my sister. She's always been supportive.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent ideas. Remember to be kind to yourself. You've done challenging work today.",
    "Client: Thank you... for guiding me through this. I... I didn't think I could face these memories.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. We'll end here for today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
