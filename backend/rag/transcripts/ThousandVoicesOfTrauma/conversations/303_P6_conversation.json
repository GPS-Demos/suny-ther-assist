    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. How distressed do you feel right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 40. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin describing the memory when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... I was 8 years old. It was a warm evening, and I was playing in the front yard of our apartment complex. I could hear raised voices coming from the parking lot...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: I saw two men arguing. They were shouting at each other, getting closer. One of them suddenly pushed the other, and then... (voice trembles) he pulled out a knife.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 65? My palms are sweaty, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's normal for distress to increase. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man with the knife lunged forward. There was so much blood... I froze. I couldn't move or scream. I just watched as the other man fell to the ground.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My SUDS is probably around 80. I can almost smell the metallic scent of blood.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice quivering) The attacker looked directly at me. His eyes were... empty. I thought he might come for me next. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. My heart is pounding so hard. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe slowly. You're doing great, Sarah.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Someone screamed. I think it was a neighbor. The man with the knife ran away. I finally found my voice and started crying. My mom came running out...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little better. Maybe 75? The tightness in my chest is easing up a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My mom held me tight. She was crying too. There were sirens, flashing lights. Everything felt surreal, like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. I feel drained, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job, Sarah. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I feel like I faced something I've been avoiding for years. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown incredible strength today."
