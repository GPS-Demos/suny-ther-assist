    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, start describing the home invasion.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at home, it's late evening. I'm sitting on the couch, watching TV. The house is quiet, my wife and kids are upstairs sleeping. Suddenly, I hear a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I freeze for a moment. Then I hear footsteps. Heavy, unfamiliar footsteps. I stand up, my hands shaking. I'm thinking about my family upstairs, feeling terrified but also angry that someone's invaded our home.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I grab the fireplace poker. It's the closest thing to a weapon. I'm moving towards the kitchen, trying to be quiet. My combat training is kicking in, but this isn't a battlefield. This is my home. I'm scared in a way I've never been before.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As I approach the kitchen, I see a shadow move. It's large, definitely a man. I grip the poker tighter, my palms are sweaty. I'm thinking about calling out, but I'm afraid of alerting him to my presence. Then, he steps into view. He's wearing a mask, all in black. Our eyes meet and time seems to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: He lunges at me. I react instinctively, swinging the poker. It connects with his shoulder. He grunts in pain, but doesn't go down. We're grappling now, and I can smell alcohol on him. It's bringing back memories of fights in bars overseas, but this is so much worse. This is my sanctuary.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: We're struggling, knocking things over. I hear my wife call out from upstairs, \"Honey, what's going on?\" The intruder takes advantage of my distraction and lands a punch to my jaw. I taste blood. I'm furious now, thinking about my family in danger. I manage to push him away and yell, \"Call the police!\"",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The intruder panics when he hears me yell. He turns to run, but I grab him. We're both on the floor now, wrestling. I'm hitting him, harder than I mean to. All I can think about is protecting my family. I hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. The intruder is struggling less now, but I can't stop. I'm terrified and angry and...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take a breath. You're here now.",
    "Client: I... I don't let up until the police arrive. When they pull me off him, I realize how much damage I've done. There's blood on my hands, on the floor. The intruder is unconscious. I feel sick, relieved, and horrified all at once. My wife is there, hugging me, crying. I can't speak. I can't believe this happened in our home.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving it is hard. I still feel the fear, the anger. But also guilt. I know I was protecting my family, but the violence... it brought me back to places I thought I'd left behind.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed feelings. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... our home never felt the same after that. We moved, but the fear followed us. I check the locks constantly. I can't relax when I hear a noise at night. It's like I'm always on guard.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are understandable. We'll address these feelings in our sessions.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's hard to talk about, but I know I need to. I want to feel safe in my own home again. I want my family to feel safe. Sometimes I wonder if I overreacted, if I could have handled it differently.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember you were protecting your family. Let's explore these thoughts more next time.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm exhausted, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common reaction. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm nervous about our next session, but I think this is helping. I want to get better, for my family and for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive attitude. We'll continue at your pace. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I'm glad I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll pick up here next time. Take care."
