    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Ramirez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's been years since I've allowed myself to really remember that day in such detail. The screeching tires, the sound of metal crunching... it's all so vivid now. I can still smell the gasoline and feel the panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I keep thinking about how I couldn't do anything to save Maria. She was right there, next to me, and then... gone. I've always prided myself on being able to protect my family, you know? But in that moment, I was completely powerless.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. But... it's strange. As terrible as it was to remember, there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, for years I've been trying to avoid thinking about the accident. I thought if I could just push it away, it would hurt less. But now, talking about it... it's still painful, but it feels like I'm finally facing it head-on. Like I'm honoring Maria's memory instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your overall recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's helping me realize that I can't change what happened, but I can change how I deal with it. For so long, I've been stuck in this cycle of guilt and avoidance. But maybe by confronting these memories, I can start to move forward. It's not easy, but it feels... necessary.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How are you coping?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's sadness, of course. But also... a strange sense of peace? Like I'm finally allowing myself to grieve properly. And... I don't know if this makes sense, but I feel closer to Maria somehow. Like by remembering her, even in those terrible moments, I'm keeping a part of her alive.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to look at it. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep going with this. It's hard, and sometimes I feel like I can't breathe when we do these exposures. But afterwards, it's like a fog is lifting. I want to be able to think about Maria without feeling overwhelmed by guilt and pain. I want to remember the good times too, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an admirable goal. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on ways for me to honor her memory? I've been so focused on the accident, I've almost forgotten all the wonderful years we had together. And... I think I need help dealing with the guilt. Even though logically I know it wasn't my fault, I still feel responsible somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Shall we explore that next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. It's not easy, but... I'm starting to see a light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know I'm not the easiest patient, especially at my age, set in my ways. But I'm grateful for your patience and understanding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredible work, Mr. Ramirez. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm ready. It's tough, but I'm committed to this process now. I want to be able to think about Maria with love instead of fear. And maybe... maybe I can start enjoying life again, without feeling like I'm betraying her memory. She wouldn't have wanted me to live like this, always afraid and isolated. So yes, I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk more about the good memories. Maybe we can work on ways for me to celebrate Maria's life, instead of just mourning her death. And... if it's okay, I'd like to learn some more techniques for managing the anxiety when it gets overwhelming. Sometimes, especially at night, the memories come flooding back and it's hard to calm down.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, I suppose. Drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've taken a step forward. It's still painful, and I know there's a long road ahead, but for the first time in years, I feel like I might actually be okay someday. Thank you for helping me see that."
