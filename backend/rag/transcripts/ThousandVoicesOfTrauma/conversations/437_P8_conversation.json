    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my whole body is tense. My heart is racing, and I can feel this knot in my stomach. The memory feels so vivid, like I'm right back there in that room, you know? I can almost smell the musty air and feel the rough texture of the rope on my wrists. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, I was completely at their mercy, and there was nothing I could do to protect myself. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\" And then I feel guilty because I survived, and I wonder why me? Why did I make it out when others didn't? It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Well, um, I guess they're not as intense as they used to be. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still difficult, but I can at least put it into words without feeling like I'm going to completely fall apart. But it's weird, you know? Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, and then other times, like now, it all comes rushing back, and I feel like I'm right back at square one.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: I... I notice my hands are shaking a bit. And my breathing is kind of shallow. It's like there's this pressure on my chest, making it hard to take a deep breath. And I'm sweating, even though the room isn't hot. It's like my body is reacting to the memory, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: How do you make sense of these physical reactions?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's my body's way of trying to protect me? Like, it's preparing for danger, even though the danger isn't here anymore. It's frustrating, though. I wish I could just tell my body to relax, that it's over now. But it's like my mind and body are disconnected somehow. My mind knows I'm safe, but my body isn't getting the message.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded in these moments?",
    "Client: Hmm... Sometimes focusing on my surroundings helps. Like, I try to notice things in the room - the color of the walls, the texture of the chair I'm sitting on. And deep breathing, when I can manage it. Oh, and sometimes I'll hold onto something, like a smooth stone or a stress ball. The physical sensation helps remind me that I'm here, in the present, not back there.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about the experience affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but also kind of relieving? Like, for so long I kept it all bottled up inside, and that was eating me alive. Talking about it, as difficult as it is, feels like I'm letting some of that pressure out. But it's also scary, you know? Sometimes I worry that if I start talking, I won't be able to stop, and all these emotions will just come pouring out, and I'll lose control.",
    "Therapist: What do you think would happen if you did \"lose control\"?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is afraid I'd just completely break down, like I'd start crying and never stop. Or that I'd get so angry I'd lash out at someone. But another part of me wonders if maybe it wouldn't be as bad as I think. Maybe it would actually be... I don't know, cathartic? But it's scary to think about. I've spent so long trying to keep it all together, the idea of letting go is terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How does this fear of losing control impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It affects everything, really. I'm always on edge, always trying to keep my emotions in check. I avoid certain places or situations that might trigger memories. I have trouble sleeping because I'm afraid of nightmares. And relationships are hard because I'm scared to let anyone get too close. It's like I'm living my life on the surface, never fully engaging with anything or anyone because I'm so afraid of what might happen if I do.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to feel more in control?",
    "Client: God, it would mean everything. To be able to go through a day without constantly looking over my shoulder or jumping at every little noise. To be able to form close relationships without this fear of being hurt again. To be able to sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. It would be like... like getting my life back, you know? Like finally being able to breathe freely again.",
    "Therapist: How do you see your progress in therapy contributing to that goal?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's helping, even if it doesn't always feel like it. Like, being able to talk about the experience without completely falling apart - that's progress, right? And learning these coping techniques, like the grounding exercises we've practiced. It's slow, and sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back. But I guess I'm starting to see that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. That maybe I'm stronger than I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: That's a tough one. I guess... I guess it's the little moments where I realize I've done something I couldn't do before. Like when I went to the mall last week - that used to be impossible for me because of the crowds. But I did it, and even though it was hard, I made it through. And talking about the experience here, that gives me hope too. It's like, if I can face it here, maybe I can face it out there in the world too. And... and I guess you give me hope too. The fact that you believe I can get better, that helps on the days when I'm not sure I believe it myself.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also kind of lighter? Like, talking about it has taken a lot out of me, but it's also like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying. My body still feels tense, but not as much as before. And my thoughts aren't racing as much. It's like... like I've walked through a storm, and now I'm on the other side. Still wet and a bit shaken up, but I made it through. And maybe that means I can make it through the next storm too.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on coping strategies for when the memories hit unexpectedly. And maybe we could talk about ways to start rebuilding my social life? I've been isolating myself a lot, and I know that's not helping. It's scary to think about putting myself out there again, but I think I'm ready to at least start talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm okay, I think. A bit emotionally drained, but also... I don't know, hopeful maybe? Like, it was hard talking about all of this, but I'm glad we did. And I'm looking forward to working on those coping strategies next time. I just... I want to thank you. For listening, for believing in me. It means a lot.",
