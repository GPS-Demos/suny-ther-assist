    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, really. A bit apprehensive, I suppose. It's been a long time since I've talked about... well, you know.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you tell me where you'd like to begin today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to talk about when we first arrived at the refugee camp. It's been on my mind lately.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Before we start, let's get a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Oh, um... maybe a 40? My heart's beating a bit faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, you're safe here. Take us to that moment.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* We've just arrived at the camp. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down, and there's dust everywhere. I can feel it in my eyes, my mouth. We're standing in a long queue, waiting to be processed. There are so many people, all looking tired and scared. I'm holding my daughter's hand \u2013 she's only five \u2013 and I can feel her trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... makeshift tents. Rows and rows of them, stretching as far as I can see. There are aid workers in blue vests, rushing around. Some people are shouting, but I can't understand what they're saying. The smell... it's overwhelming. Sweat and fear and something else I can't quite place.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My legs feel weak, and I'm trying so hard not to show it. I need to be strong for my daughter. But inside, I'm screaming. We left everything behind, and I don't know what's going to happen to us.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're moving forward in the line. An aid worker approaches us. He's speaking English, but I can barely understand him. He's asking for our papers, but... oh God, I can't find them. I'm frantically searching my bag, and people behind us are getting impatient. My daughter starts crying, and I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking, \"This is it. They'll send us back.\" I can't go back. We'll die if we go back. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold onto my bag. I want to cry, to scream, but I can't. I have to stay strong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: *voice trembling* I know, I know. It just feels so real. I can almost smell the dust again.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75 now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I finally find the papers. They're crumpled and dirty, but they're there. The aid worker takes them, looks them over. He's frowning, and my heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. He calls over another worker, they're discussing something. I can't understand what they're saying, and the uncertainty is killing me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and I feel like I can't breathe properly. My mouth is dry, and I'm sweating, even though I feel cold inside.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they stamp our papers. The aid worker hands them back to me and points towards a group of tents. He's saying something, but I can barely hear him over the blood rushing in my ears. We're... we're being let in. I almost collapse with relief, but I can't. Not yet. I have to stay strong for my daughter.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Relieved, but still so scared. We're in, but what now? Where will we sleep? What will we eat? How long will we be here?",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're managing well. Continue.",
    "Client: We're walking towards the tents. My daughter is clinging to me, and I can feel her little hand sweating in mine. The ground is uneven, and I'm so tired I'm afraid I might stumble. We reach the tents, and another aid worker is there. She's kinder, smiling at us. She shows us to a tent \u2013 it's small, barely big enough for the two of us, but it's shelter.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you enter the tent?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. There's a sense of relief, but also dread. This tiny space is our home now. I don't know for how long. I sit down on the thin mattress, and my daughter curls up next to me. She's stopped crying, but she's so quiet. Too quiet. I stroke her hair, trying to comfort her, but I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I want to break down and cry. But I can't. I have to be strong. I look around the tent \u2013 there's nothing here but the mattress and a small box with some supplies. Outside, I can hear the sounds of the camp \u2013 people talking, children crying, the occasional shout. It's all so foreign, so scary.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 65. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* I... I remember thinking, \"This is our life now.\" And it terrified me. How would we survive here? What would happen to us? I felt so alone, so isolated. Even though there were thousands of people around us, I felt like we were the only ones in the world.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I start unpacking our small bag. We have so little \u2013 a change of clothes, a few photographs, my daughter's favorite stuffed animal. As I'm doing this, reality starts to sink in. This isn't just a bad dream. This is our life now. I... I feel a lump in my throat, and I'm trying so hard not to cry.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *voice breaking* I know, I know. It's just... it's still so vivid. I can almost feel the scratchy blanket they gave us, smell the musty air in the tent.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's hard, but I'm okay. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 55 now?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're managing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... As night falls, the camp gets quieter, but not silent. There are still sounds \u2013 people talking softly, babies crying in the distance. The tent offers little protection from the cold night air. I'm lying on the mattress, my daughter curled up against me, finally asleep. But I can't sleep. I'm too alert, too scared.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about home. About the life we left behind. I'm wondering if we made the right choice, if this uncertainty is better than the danger we fled. I'm worried about my daughter \u2013 how will this affect her? Will she ever have a normal life? And I'm... I'm angry. Angry at the circumstances that forced us here, angry at the world for letting this happen.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How does your body feel as you're thinking this?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My jaw is clenched, and I realize I'm holding my breath. I try to relax, to breathe, but it's hard. Every unfamiliar sound makes me jump. I'm exhausted, but too wired to sleep.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I must have dozed off at some point because I wake up to the sound of the camp coming to life. It's early, the sun barely up, but there's already movement outside. My daughter is still asleep, and for a moment, I just watch her. She looks so peaceful, so unaware of the challenges we face.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Determined. Scared, still, but determined. I know we have a long, hard road ahead of us, but looking at my daughter, I know I have to be strong. I have to make this work, for her sake.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful feeling. Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down more. Maybe 45?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still hard to talk about, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You're processing these memories. How do you feel about stopping here for today?",
    "Client: I think... I think that would be good. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you're safe now. We'll continue working through this at your pace."
