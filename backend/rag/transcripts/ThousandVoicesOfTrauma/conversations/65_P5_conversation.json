    "Therapist: Hello, Amir. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving that home invasion... it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to forget it, and now you want me to remember it in detail? I'm not sure I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Remember, this helps process trauma.",
    "Client: I get that, but... it's just... every time I think about it, I feel like I'm right back there. My heart races, I can't breathe properly, and I feel so helpless. It's like I'm that scared kid again, hiding in the closet while strangers ransack our house. How is reliving that supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: By facing it, we reduce its power over you. It'll be challenging, but I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Thompson. It's just... I've worked so hard to build a life where I feel safe. I'm finally doing well in my studies, even though living with my parents at 30 isn't ideal. I'm worried this will set me back. What if I can't handle it and end up worse than before?",
    "Therapist: Your progress is commendable. This process aims to enhance, not hinder it. Shall we discuss specifics?",
    "Client: Okay, I guess so. But can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? And what should I expect to feel? I'm already feeling pretty anxious just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You might feel distressed, but it'll decrease. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I understand. It's just... this whole thing brings up so many emotions. Not just about the home invasion, but about everything else too. The bullying I went through, my struggles with depression... it all feels connected somehow. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Traumas often interlink. We'll address each aspect carefully.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I guess I'm just worried about opening this can of worms. But if you think it'll help... I trust you, Dr. Thompson. You've helped me a lot already. I just hope I'm strong enough for this.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident, Amir. This takes courage, which you've shown. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do it. But can we start slowly? And if it gets too overwhelming, can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll go at your pace. You're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I'm still scared, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? If this can help me move past this trauma and live a normal life, it'll be worth it. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Amir. Let's begin gently. Close your eyes when you're ready."
