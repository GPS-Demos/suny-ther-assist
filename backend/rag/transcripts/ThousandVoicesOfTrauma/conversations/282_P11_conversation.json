    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment in the prison cell... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to bury for years.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The isolation. The crushing loneliness. I remember sitting there, staring at those cold, gray walls, thinking about my family outside. My kids growing up without me. It was... it was suffocating.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. I felt that same tightness in my chest, you know? Like I couldn't breathe. But... but it was different this time. I knew I was here, in your office, not back there. It helped a little.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I still feel that isolation sometimes. Even when I'm with my family. It's like part of me is still locked away in that cell, unable to fully connect with them.",
    "Therapist: I see. What insights did you gain from this experience?",
    "Client: I realized that maybe I've been pushing people away. Keeping myself isolated, even though I'm not physically alone anymore. It's like... I'm still punishing myself, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on opening up more. To my family, to friends. I've been so focused on appearing strong, on not burdening them with my struggles. But maybe that's just keeping me trapped in my own personal prison.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But... I think it's necessary. I want to feel truly present in my life again, you know? To be there for my kids, to enjoy the little moments without this... this shadow hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I... I could try talking to my daughter about how I'm feeling. She's been asking, and I've been brushing her off. Maybe I could open up a little, let her in.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a light at the end of this very long tunnel. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive shift. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to reconnect with my family. How to bridge this gap I've created. And maybe... maybe talk more about the guilt I still carry from that time.",
    "Therapist: That's a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to make some progress. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. We'll continue this work next week."
