    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol in a rural area of Afghanistan. It was early morning, and we were walking through a small village. Suddenly, I heard growling and barking. Before I could react, a large dog lunged at me from behind a wall.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The dog was huge, probably a guard dog. Its teeth were bared, and it went straight for my leg. I tried to jump back, but it was too fast. I felt its teeth sink into my calf, and the pain was intense. I yelled out, and my squad mates turned to see what was happening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the fear. It wasn't just about the dog; I was worried about alerting enemy forces. The dog's growls were so loud, and I was afraid it would draw attention to our position. I could smell the dust and the dog's breath. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to shake the dog off, but it wouldn't let go. One of my squad mates rushed over and started hitting the dog with his rifle butt. The dog finally released my leg, but then it turned on him. I felt guilty and scared for my friend, but I was also relieved it wasn't me anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The whole thing probably only lasted a minute or two, but it felt like forever. When the dog finally ran off, I was shaking. My leg was bleeding badly, and I was worried about infection. But mostly, I felt ashamed. I was supposed to be a soldier, and I got taken down by a dog.",
    "Therapist: You handled a difficult situation. How did you feel afterwards?",
    "Client: Embarrassed, mostly. And angry at myself for not being more alert. But also grateful to my squad mate who helped me. The medic patched me up, but I had to be extra careful for the rest of the patrol. I kept thinking about how it could have been worse, how I could have endangered the whole squad.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well describing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. My heart is racing a bit, and I can almost feel the pain in my leg again. But I also feel a little better getting it out. It's like I've been carrying this around for so long, and now I'm finally unpacking it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks. You know, I've never really told anyone the full story before. It always seemed so minor compared to other things that happened during deployment. But it really shook me up. For weeks after, I'd jump at any sudden noise or movement. I still get nervous around large dogs.",
    "Therapist: It's important to acknowledge its impact. Please continue.",
    "Client: After we got back to base, I had to get rabies shots. That was almost worse than the attack itself. The needles, the fear of potentially developing rabies... it was a lot to handle. And the guys, they tried to be supportive, but there were jokes too. You know, calling me \"dog chow\" and stuff like that. I laughed it off, but it hurt.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How did this affect you long-term?",
    "Client: It changed me. I became hyper-vigilant, always scanning for threats. Not just during patrols, but even when I got back home. I'd wake up in cold sweats, dreaming about the attack. Sometimes in my dreams, it wasn't just one dog, but a whole pack. And sometimes, they weren't dogs at all, but wolves or even monsters.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing it now.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's strange, but talking about it like this, I can see how much it affected me. Not just the physical scar on my leg, but the mental scars too. I've been carrying this fear and shame for so long. Maybe it's time to start letting it go.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaky, but also relieved. It's like I've been holding my breath for years, and I'm finally exhaling. I know it's just one session, but I feel like I'm starting to see this experience differently. Not as a failure on my part, but as something I survived and can learn from.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought talking about it could make such a difference. It's still a scary memory, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming now. I'm glad I finally shared this. I think... I think I'm ready to start working on not letting this control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but in a good way. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing this work. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
