    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's not easy going back there, you know? Reliving that night when those men broke into my home. I can still hear the sound of glass breaking, and my heart just races. It's like I'm right back there, frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I've always prided myself on being independent, even after George passed. But in that moment, I felt so... vulnerable. Like everything I'd built over the years could be taken away in an instant. It's silly, I know, but I keep thinking about the family photos they knocked over. Those memories scattered on the floor... it just broke my heart.",
    "Therapist: It's not silly at all. How did it feel to share that today?",
    "Client: It was... surprisingly relieving, actually. I've kept this bottled up for so long. My kids, they mean well, but they just tell me to forget about it and move on. But how can I? It's like this dark cloud that follows me everywhere. Being able to talk about it, to really delve into those feelings... it's scary, but also... I don't know, freeing in a way?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How does this connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm always on edge, you know? Every little noise in the night sends me into a panic. I've been drinking more than I should, just to calm my nerves and help me sleep. It's affecting my relationships too. I don't want my grandkids to visit because I'm afraid something might happen to them. It's like I'm pushing everyone away, living in this bubble of fear.",
    "Therapist: I see. What have you learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to realize that avoiding these memories isn't helping. It's like they have more power when I try to push them away. Talking about it, as hard as it is, makes it feel a little less overwhelming. And maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that night, didn't I? Perhaps I can survive talking about it too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, if I'm being honest. But there's a part of me that feels... hopeful? Like maybe there's a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. I want to be present for my family again, to enjoy life without constantly looking over my shoulder. If this can help me get there, then... I think I'm willing to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: I suppose... that it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes. That doesn't make me weak. And maybe, just maybe, by facing these fears head-on, I can start to reclaim some of the peace I've lost. It won't be easy, but I'm tired of letting that night control my life. I want to be me again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. How can we support you until next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try writing down some of these thoughts when they come up? Instead of reaching for a drink, I mean. And perhaps I could call my daughter, just to chat. I've been avoiding her calls, but I miss her. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think that's enough for today. It's exhausting, this process, but... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I'm not an easy patient, especially with my... well, my drinking and all. But I appreciate your patience. I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward, even if it's just a tiny glimmer right now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mrs. Johnson. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again, doctor. I... I think I might actually look forward to our next session. Who would've thought, huh? An old lady like me, excited about therapy. Life's full of surprises, I suppose."
