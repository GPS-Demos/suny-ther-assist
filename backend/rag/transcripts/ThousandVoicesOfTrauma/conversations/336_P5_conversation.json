    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've heard about exposure therapy, but I'm not entirely sure what to expect. The idea of revisiting my experiences with the cult makes me uneasy. I've spent so much time trying to forget about it all.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that talking about it in detail might bring back all those intense emotions I felt back then. The shame, the confusion, the fear... It's not something I'm eager to relive. And what if I can't handle it? What if I break down or panic?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's address them together.",
    "Client: Okay, I appreciate that. I guess I'm also wondering how this is supposed to help me. Won't talking about it just make everything worse? I've been trying so hard to move on with my life, to focus on my relationship and my career. The last thing I want is to take steps backward.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps by processing memories. It won't set you back.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, I suppose. But how exactly does it work? What will I need to do during these sessions? And how long will this process take? I'm worried about the impact it might have on my daily life, especially at work. I've been struggling with depression as it is, and I don't want this to make things worse.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit memories gradually. You'll describe experiences in detail. I'll guide you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as intimidating as I thought. But I'm still a bit worried about how intense it might get. What if I start feeling overwhelmed? Or what if I can't remember enough details to make it effective? My memory of that time is pretty hazy in some parts, probably as a defense mechanism.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can pause anytime. Hazy memories are normal.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm just trying to prepare myself mentally for what's to come. Do you think this will help with my depression as well? And how will I know if it's working?",
    "Therapist: It may help depression too. Progress can be gradual. We'll monitor changes together.",
    "Client: Alright, that makes sense. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. I trust your expertise, and I'm willing to give this a try. Is there anything I should do to prepare for our next session when we actually start the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your willingness is key. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think you've covered most of my concerns for now. I'm sure more will come up as we go along, but I feel more comfortable with the idea. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything. I'm cautiously optimistic about this process.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Your courage is commendable. Ready to begin next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. It won't be easy, but I'm ready to face this and work towards healing. Thank you for your support and guidance. I'll see you at our next session.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take care, John. See you then."
