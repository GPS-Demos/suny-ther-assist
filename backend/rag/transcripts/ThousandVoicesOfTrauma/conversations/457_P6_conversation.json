    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you tell me about your experience with the cult, starting from the beginning?",
    "Client: Okay... I was 18 when I first got involved. It started innocently enough. I was feeling lost, you know? Struggling with classes, far from home. This group on campus seemed so welcoming. They invited me to meetings, offered support. At first, it felt like I'd found a family.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 3? I'm a bit nervous talking about this, but it's not too bad yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Please continue.",
    "Client: Well, things changed gradually. They started demanding more of my time, isolating me from other friends. There were these intense meditation sessions that left me disoriented. I remember one night, after hours of chanting, I felt so detached from reality. It was terrifying, but they said it was enlightenment.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's going up... maybe a 5? My heart's beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Thanks. Um, so they started controlling everything. What I ate, who I talked to, even my thoughts. If I questioned anything, they'd shame me, say I was weak or unfaithful. I remember this one leader, he'd single me out in group sessions, make me confess my \"sins\" in front of everyone. God, it was humiliating.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's definitely higher. Maybe a 7? I feel sick to my stomach remembering this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard to talk about. They... they made me cut off contact with my family. Said they were holding me back from true enlightenment. I missed my sister's wedding because of them. I can't believe I let that happen. I feel so stupid...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. I'm shaking a bit. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's completely normal. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... The worst part was when they started pushing us to recruit others. I brought in a friend from my dorm. He ended up dropping out of school, giving all his money to the group. I feel so guilty. I can't shake the feeling that I ruined his life.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed. My chest feels tight. I can't believe I did that to him.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're processing difficult memories.",
    "Client: I'm trying... It's just... I wasted two years of my life with them. When I finally left, I felt so lost. No friends, behind in school, my family was hurt and confused. I started drinking a lot to cope. It's like they took everything from me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel angry and ashamed. My hands are clenched, and I'm sweating.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thanks... I'm trying to remind myself that I got out. I'm back in school now, rebuilding relationships. But sometimes I still have nightmares about being trapped there. I worry about the people who are still in the cult. I should have done something to help them...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level currently?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now? I feel drained, but talking about it... it helps, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to believe all of this happened. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from it.",
    "Therapist: Recovery is a journey. You're taking important steps. SUDS level?",
    "Client: I think it's down to a 5 now. I feel... I don't know, a mix of sadness and relief?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You did well today."
