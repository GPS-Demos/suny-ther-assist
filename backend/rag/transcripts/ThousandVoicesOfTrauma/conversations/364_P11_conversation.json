    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that home invasion memory again... it's intense. I could almost smell the gunpowder, you know? It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most this time?",
    "Client: The sound of glass breaking. It was so loud in my mind. I remember thinking, \"This isn't like the war. This is my home. My family's here.\" And that... that terrified me more than anything I experienced in combat. I felt so helpless, so unprepared.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness compare to now?",
    "Client: It's... different. I mean, I'm safe here, logically I know that. But there's still this part of me that's on high alert. Like, I keep glancing at the door, even though I know no one's coming in. It's exhausting, always feeling like I need to be ready.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: My hands. I kept focusing on my hands. In combat, I always had a weapon, something to defend myself with. But during the invasion, my hands were empty. I remember thinking, \"What can I do? How can I protect my family?\" It made me feel... inadequate, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like, I've been carrying this around for so long, and now it's out there. It's still painful, but it feels less... heavy, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. How do you think this connects to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it explains why I'm always checking the locks, why I have trouble sleeping. I'm still trying to protect my family from something that's already happened. It's like... I'm stuck in that moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: It's... frustrating. I want to move on, to feel safe in my own home again. But it's like my mind won't let me. I keep reliving it, even when I don't want to. But... I don't know, maybe talking about it like this is helping? It feels different than just thinking about it on my own.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: It's more... structured, I guess? Like, I'm not just spiraling in my thoughts. We're breaking it down, looking at it piece by piece. It's still uncomfortable, but it feels... manageable. Like maybe I can actually work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to keep going with this. It's tough, but I can see how it might help. Maybe if I can face this memory head-on, I can start to let go of some of this constant vigilance. I want to be present for my family, not always stuck in the past or worrying about the future.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... determined. I've faced tough things before. This is just another challenge, right? And if it means I can finally feel at peace in my own home... well, that's worth fighting for.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm not alone in this anymore. And that... that means a lot."
