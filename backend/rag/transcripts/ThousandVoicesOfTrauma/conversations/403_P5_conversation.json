    "Therapist: Hello, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the dog attack lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... every time I think about that day, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I'm right back there. I'm worried that if we talk about it, I'll completely fall apart. I mean, I'm barely holding it together as it is with school and everything else going on. And to be honest, I'm not entirely sure how talking about it is supposed to help. Isn't it better to just try to forget?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would be helpful. I mean, I trust you, Dr. Thompson, but I'm just really scared about what might happen if I let myself go there, you know? It's like I've built this wall around that memory, and I'm terrified of what might happen if we break it down. But at the same time, I'm so tired of feeling this way. The nightmares, the constant anxiety, always looking over my shoulder... it's exhausting. So if this can help, I want to try. I just need to understand how it works.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Imaginal exposure helps process the trauma. We'll go slowly, and you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. But what exactly will we be doing? Will I have to close my eyes and relive the whole thing? And what if I start panicking? I'm worried I might have a complete breakdown or something. Also, I'm curious about how long this process usually takes. Will we be doing this in every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll start gradually. You'll describe the event, and I'll guide you. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That sounds a bit less daunting. I appreciate that we can take breaks if needed. I guess I'm just worried about opening this can of worms and not being able to close it again. Like, what if talking about it makes the nightmares and flashbacks even worse? Or what if I discover something about the event that I've been blocking out all this time? I'm not sure I'm ready for that. But then again, I know I can't keep living like this either. It's affecting my studies, my relationship... everything, really.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are normal. This process helps reduce symptoms over time. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready to give it a try. I mean, I'm still nervous, but I understand the purpose better now. And knowing that you'll be here to guide me through it helps a lot. I trust you, Dr. Thompson. You've helped me with my depression, so I believe you when you say this can help with the trauma too. I just hope I can get through it without completely falling apart. But I guess that's why we're doing this in a controlled environment, right? So, um... where do we start? Do I just start talking about that day, or do you have specific questions for me?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. Describe where you were before the attack.",
    "Client: Alright, I can do that. I was at the local park near my apartment. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, and I had decided to go for a run to clear my head. I remember feeling pretty good that day, actually. The weather was perfect, not too hot, and there was a nice breeze. I had my headphones in, listening to my favorite playlist. The park was busy, lots of families and other joggers around. I was about halfway through my usual route when... well, that's when it happened. But you probably want me to stop there for now, right?",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I think. My heart rate is picking up a little, but it's not too bad. Talking about the park and the day itself isn't too scary. It's weird, though. Even describing those normal, happy moments before the attack makes me feel a bit anxious. Like I want to go back in time and warn myself, you know? But I'm managing. I'm actually a bit surprised that I could recall those details without freaking out. Is that normal? To be able to remember the good parts so clearly?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's normal. You're doing well. Ready to continue?",
    "Client: Thanks, that's reassuring. And yeah, I think I'm ready to keep going. I mean, my palms are getting a bit sweaty, and I can feel my anxiety rising, but it's not overwhelming yet. I'm a bit scared of what comes next, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little empowered? Like, I've avoided thinking about this for so long, and now I'm finally facing it. It's terrifying, but also kind of liberating in a way. Is it okay if we take it slow from here? And can you remind me what I should do if I start to feel overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll go slow. If overwhelmed, we'll pause and use grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Okay, got it. Grounding techniques, right. Like focusing on my breath and noticing things in the room, yeah? I think I can do that. It's good to know we have a safety net. Alright, so... I guess the next part is when I first noticed the dog. God, my heart is really pounding now. But I want to keep going. I need to get through this. So, um, I had just rounded a corner on the path, and that's when I saw it. A large dog, I think it was a Rottweiler, and it was off-leash. At first, I didn't think much of it, but then I realized its owner was pretty far behind and the dog was looking right at me...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you're safe here."
