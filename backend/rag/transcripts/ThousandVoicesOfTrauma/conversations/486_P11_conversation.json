    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that hostage situation is still so vivid, you know? I can still feel the tension in my body, the fear... It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Being trapped, not knowing if I'd make it out alive. It's... it's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how my family must have felt, not knowing if I was okay. And then there's this guilt, you know? Like, why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... I don't know, maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be? I mean, it was still awful, but I didn't completely fall apart like I feared I might.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for? It's strange, but going through it again, I noticed things I hadn't before. Like how I managed to stay calm enough to comfort the person next to me. I'd forgotten about that.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does that relate to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, it makes me think that maybe I have more control than I thought. I've been feeling so powerless since the incident, but remembering that I could still help someone else... it gives me hope, I suppose. Like maybe I can get through this after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I could try to focus more on the things I can control in my daily life? And perhaps... perhaps I could be a bit kinder to myself. I've been so caught up in what I couldn't do during the hostage situation that I've ignored what I did manage to do.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does that connect to your depression symptoms?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I hadn't thought about that. I guess... I've been so focused on the negatives, it's been feeding into my depression. Maybe if I can shift my perspective a bit, acknowledge the positives too, it might help lift my mood? It's not going to fix everything, but... it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much I've been isolating myself. In the memory, I kept thinking about my partner, my family, how much I wanted to see them again. But since it happened, I've been pushing them away. I'm scared of being vulnerable, I think. Of letting them see how much I'm struggling.",
    "Therapist: How might opening up to them impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it could help. Maybe talking about it would make it less overwhelming? And having their support... it could make me feel less alone in all this. But it's scary, you know? What if they don't understand? What if it's too much for them?",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. How could you address those fears?",
    "Client: I guess... I could start small? Maybe tell my partner one thing about how I'm feeling, see how it goes. And remind myself that they want to help, even if they don't always know how. It's just... it's hard to let people in when you're used to dealing with everything on your own.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's one step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could tell my partner about this session. Not everything, but just... that I'm working on processing what happened. That it's hard, but I'm trying. That feels doable, I think. Scary, but doable.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great start. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought I was. It's a small thing, but it feels important somehow.",
    "Therapist: It is important. You've done good work today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel like it, but... I guess I am making progress, aren't I? Slowly, but still. I just hope I can keep this perspective when things get tough again.",
    "Therapist: That's what we're here for. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for guiding me through it. I know I have a long way to go, but... maybe I can do this after all.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
