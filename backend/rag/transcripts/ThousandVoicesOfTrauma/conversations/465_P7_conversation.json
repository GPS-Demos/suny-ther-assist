    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the memory of your severe illness?",
    "Client: Okay... I remember being in the hospital. The room was so white and sterile. I was lying in bed, feeling weak and scared. The doctors had just told me I had a rare autoimmune disorder. I couldn't believe it was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt so alone. My parents were there, but they looked terrified. I could see the worry in their eyes. The machines were beeping constantly, and nurses kept coming in and out. I felt like I was in a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to breathe just thinking about it. I remember the pain... it was everywhere. My joints ached, my head pounded, and I was so tired. I couldn't even lift my arm without feeling exhausted. I kept thinking, \"Is this how I'm going to live for the rest of my life?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The worst part was when they started the treatments. The medication made me so sick. I was vomiting constantly, and my hair started falling out. I felt like I was losing myself. Every time I looked in the mirror, I saw a stranger. I was only 22, but I felt like I was dying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I remember one night, I overheard the doctors talking to my parents. They were saying that if the treatment didn't work, they weren't sure what else they could do. I felt so helpless and angry. Why was this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue sharing what you're feeling.",
    "Client: I started to withdraw from everyone. My friends would visit, but I couldn't bear to see the pity in their eyes. I felt like a burden to everyone. The emotional pain was almost worse than the physical pain. I was supposed to be starting my career, dating, living my life... instead, I was fighting just to survive each day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: The loneliness was crushing. Even though people were around, I felt so isolated. No one could understand what I was going through. I started having panic attacks, especially at night. I was terrified of falling asleep, afraid I might not wake up.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember thinking about giving up. The pain and fear were overwhelming. But then I saw how much it was hurting my family. I felt guilty for even considering it. I was trapped between wanting it all to end and feeling obligated to keep fighting.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: Slowly, very slowly, I started to improve. But the fear never really left. Every twinge or ache sent me into a spiral of anxiety. I was afraid to hope, afraid to believe I could get better. The trauma of it all... it changed me. I'm not the same person I was before.",
    "Therapist: You've come so far. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's bringing back all those emotions. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I'm finally acknowledging how much it affected me. It's still scary to think about, but maybe it's not as overwhelming as it used to be.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think I need a moment to just breathe. Can we sit quietly for a bit? I want to remind myself that I'm here now, that I'm okay. It's over, but sometimes it feels so fresh in my mind.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that time together."
