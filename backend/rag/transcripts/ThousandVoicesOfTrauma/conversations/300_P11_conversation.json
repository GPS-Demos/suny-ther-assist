    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of my cancer diagnosis again... it's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? I could feel the cold exam table, smell the antiseptic in the air. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so intense. When the doctor said \"malignant,\" I felt like the floor dropped out from under me. My heart was racing, and I couldn't catch my breath. It's funny, I thought I'd processed all this already, but reliving it... it brought back how terrified I was of dying.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel now?",
    "Client: It's... less intense, I guess? But still there. Like a shadow hanging over me. I know I'm in remission, but part of me is always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's exhausting, constantly being on edge like that.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I find myself avoiding health-related things. I put off check-ups, ignore minor symptoms. It's like if I don't acknowledge it, it can't hurt me. But then I feel guilty and anxious about not taking care of myself. It's a vicious cycle.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I guess I realized how much that fear is still controlling me. Even though I'm physically healthy now, emotionally I'm still stuck in that moment of diagnosis. It's affecting my relationships too. I push people away because I'm scared of leaving them if I get sick again. Or maybe I'm scared of them leaving me. I don't know.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start facing these fears head-on. Maybe if I stop avoiding health stuff, it'll get easier. And I could try opening up to my friends about why I've been distant. It's scary, but... I'm tired of living like this.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a brave step. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... kind of hopeful? Like maybe there's a way out of this constant state of anxiety. I know it won't be easy, but I want to try. I want to feel like I'm living again, not just surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remember that facing my fears doesn't mean the worst will happen. It's about regaining control, right? The cancer took so much from me, but I don't want it to keep taking my present and future too. I want to work on living fully, even with the uncertainty. It's scary, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent reflection. How will you apply this?",
    "Client: Well, I've been putting off scheduling my annual check-up. I think I'll do that this week. And maybe I'll reach out to my old friend Emma. We used to be so close, and I've been avoiding her calls. It's time to explain why and try to reconnect. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling now?",

    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. Next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see the value in these sessions. I'm curious to see where this journey takes me. A bit scared too, but... I'm ready to face it. See you next week, doc."
