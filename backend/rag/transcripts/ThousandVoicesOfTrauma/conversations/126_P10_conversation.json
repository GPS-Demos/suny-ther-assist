    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the cyber bullying, and it's bringing up a lot of emotions already.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 40? My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting at my desk in my shared apartment. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. The room is dark except for the glow of my laptop screen. I can hear my roommate watching TV in the living room, but it's muffled. I'm scrolling through social media, and suddenly I see it. A post about me. It's... it's cruel.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My heart starts racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are getting sweaty, and I'm gripping the mouse so tightly my knuckles are turning white. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The post... it's making fun of my accent. Someone recorded me during a presentation at work and posted a clip, mocking the way I pronounce certain words. There are already dozens of comments, laughing emojis. I feel so exposed, so... humiliated.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60? My chest feels really tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I can't stop reading the comments. Each one feels like a punch to the gut. \"Go back to where you came from,\" one says. \"Learn to speak English properly,\" says another. I want to defend myself, but I'm paralyzed. I just keep scrolling, feeling more and more isolated.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking maybe they're right. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe all my hard work to get this job, to build a life here... maybe it's all been for nothing. I feel so small, so... insignificant.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I close the laptop suddenly. I can't bear to look anymore. But closing it doesn't make the feelings go away. I'm shaking now. I feel hot and cold at the same time. I want to cry, but the tears won't come. I just feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75? I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember, you're here in this room, safe. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I get up from my desk. My legs feel wobbly. I walk to the bathroom, stumbling a bit. I need to splash some water on my face. In the mirror, I barely recognize myself. My eyes are wide, panicked. I look... defeated.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Shame. So much shame. I've always been proud of my heritage, of how far I've come. But in this moment, I feel like I want to erase every trace of where I came from. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're describing a memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm trying to calm down, but my mind keeps racing. What if my boss sees this? What if my colleagues are laughing at me behind my back? I've worked so hard to be taken seriously, and now... now I feel like a joke.",
    "Therapist: What do you do to cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I call my sister. It's late, but I need to hear a friendly voice. She answers, groggy from sleep. I try to explain what happened, but I'm crying now. The words come out in a jumble of English and Spanish. I feel so... lost.",
    "Therapist: How does your sister respond?",
    "Client: She's angry. Furious at the people who did this. She tells me to report it, to fight back. But I feel so drained. The idea of confronting this... it's overwhelming. I just want it to go away.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 70? Talking about it... it's bringing it all back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maria. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the plant in the corner. The blue painting on the wall. And... and your notepad.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's continue. What happens the next morning?",
    "Client: I... I barely slept. My eyes are puffy from crying. I consider calling in sick, but the thought of staying home alone with my thoughts is worse. So I drag myself to work. Every glance, every whisper... I'm paranoid that they're talking about me, laughing at me.",
    "Therapist: How do you manage at work?",
    "Client: I'm distracted all day. I make mistakes I normally wouldn't. In a meeting, I stumble over my words, and I'm sure everyone notices. My face feels hot. I want to run, to hide. But I force myself to stay, to pretend everything's normal.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... maybe I should just quit. Find a job where I don't have to speak in public. Or maybe... maybe I should move back home. Give up on this dream of building a life here. It feels like... like I'm fighting a losing battle.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are thoughts, not facts. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 60? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, releasing something?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the experience. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I decide to confide in a coworker. Someone I trust. I show her the post, my hands shaking as I pull it up on my phone. I'm terrified of her reaction, but... but she's outraged on my behalf. She offers to help me report it, to stand up to the bullies.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved, I guess? And... and a little stronger. Like maybe I'm not as alone as I thought. But there's still this knot of anxiety in my stomach. The fear that this could happen again, that I'll always be seen as... as an outsider.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How do you cope with that fear?",
    "Client: I... I start seeing a therapist. That's when I first learned about my medical trauma, how it might be connected to this fear of being vulnerable, of being hurt. I also... I join a support group for other immigrants. Hearing their stories... it helps. It reminds me that I'm not alone in this struggle.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How does this experience change you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me more cautious online. I'm more careful about what I share, who I trust. But it also... it ignites something in me. A determination to not let them win. I start volunteering, helping other Latin American professionals navigate the workplace. It doesn't erase the pain, but it... it gives it purpose, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful transformation. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 40? Talking about how I've grown from this... it helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Maria. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... but also a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Let's take a few minutes to decompress and discuss some self-care strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. You've shown incredible strength today."
