    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm honestly a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will bring back all those intense feelings of fear and helplessness. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart? And... I'm also concerned about how this might affect my work. I've been struggling to keep it together at the office as it is.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain why we need to do this? And what exactly will happen during the exercise? I think knowing what to expect might help me feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. But how does it actually work? And what will I need to do during the session? Will you be guiding me through it, or am I supposed to just start talking about what happened?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you with questions. We'll focus on thoughts, feelings, and sensations. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds intense, but I think I understand. I appreciate that you'll be there to guide me. I'm still scared, but knowing you'll be there helps. Can we take breaks if it gets too overwhelming? And what should I do if I start to panic?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. If you panic, we'll use grounding techniques. Your safety is priority. What else would help you feel secure?",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I think it would help if we could agree on a signal or a word I can use if I need a break. And maybe... could we have some water nearby? Sometimes when I get anxious, my throat gets really dry.",
    "Therapist: Great idea. Let's use \"pause\" as our signal. I'll have water ready. Your comfort is important. Anything else?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. But before we start, can I ask... have you done this with other clients who've been through natural disasters? Did it help them?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I've worked with similar cases. Many clients found it helpful in reducing their PTSD symptoms. Your bravery is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. I'm still scared, but I trust you, and I really want to get better. This earthquake has controlled my life for too long. I want to be able to feel safe again, to not panic every time I feel a slight tremor or hear a loud noise. So yes, let's do this. I'll do my best to stay with the memories, even when it gets tough.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Remember, we're in this together. Let's start when you're ready."
