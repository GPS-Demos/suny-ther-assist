    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, I... I'm not quite sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... well, terrified, I suppose. It's been so long since I've really talked about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... yes, I think so. Though my hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 6. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our old house. It's dark, and I can hear muffled voices from downstairs. I'm supposed to be asleep, but something woke me up. I'm... I'm about 12, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear raised voices. My father, he's shouting. And there's a crash, like something breaking. My mother's crying. I... I want to go down, but I'm frozen in bed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel cold, and my stomach's in knots. I... I can't seem to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I... I hear footsteps on the stairs. Heavy footsteps. It's my father. He's... he's drunk again. I can smell the alcohol from here. I'm terrified he'll come into my room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear my mother pleading. She's saying, \"Please, not in front of the children.\" But he's... he's dragging her into my brother's room. I can hear my little brother crying now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I want to help, but I'm so scared. I curl up under my blanket, trying to block out the sounds. But I can still hear everything. The slaps, the cries... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You were just a child. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell my own fear. It's like a metallic taste in my mouth. My nightgown is damp with sweat. I'm shaking so hard the bed is creaking, and I'm terrified he'll hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're very present in the memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. It's like I'm back there, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on my voice. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... okay. I see... the painting on the wall, your desk, the plant in the corner, the clock, and... and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear my father stumbling back to his room. My mother's sobs are quieter now. I want to go to her, to my brother, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I lie there, wide awake, until the sun comes up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How do you feel in the morning?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Exhausted. When I go downstairs, my mother's at the stove, acting like nothing happened. Her eye is swollen shut, but she's humming as she makes breakfast. I... I don't know what to say.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to say to her?",
    "Client: I... I want to tell her we should leave. That we don't have to live like this. But the words stick in my throat. I just sit down and eat my cereal, avoiding her gaze.",
    "Therapist: That must have been so difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7, I think. I feel a mix of anger and sadness now.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: The day goes on like normal. We don't talk about what happened. My brother is quiet, withdrawn. I catch him looking at me, his eyes full of fear and confusion. I feel like I've failed him somehow.",
    "Therapist: You were both victims. How does that realization make you feel now?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel angry. Furious, actually. Why didn't anyone help us? Why did we have to live like that?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. Let yourself experience that emotion. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My... my fists are clenched. My jaw is tight. I feel this... this rage bubbling up inside me. I want to scream, to break something.",
    "Therapist: You're safe to express those feelings here. What would you say if you could?",
    "Client: I... I'd tell him he's a monster. That he destroyed our childhood, our sense of safety. That I'll never forgive him for what he did to us, to Mom. I... I hate him.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful emotions. How does it feel to say that out loud?",
    "Client: It's... it's liberating, in a way. But also terrifying. I've never allowed myself to feel this angry before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8. My heart's racing again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Let's continue with the memory. What happens in the following days?",
    "Client: It's... it's like walking on eggshells. Dad acts like nothing happened, but there's this tension in the air. Mom's jumpy, always watching him out of the corner of her eye. I start having nightmares, waking up in cold sweats.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I throw myself into my schoolwork. It's the only thing I can control. I stay late at school, volunteer for extra activities, anything to avoid being at home. But the guilt... the guilt of leaving my brother there eats at me.",
    "Therapist: That was a difficult position for a child to be in. How do you feel towards your younger self now?",
    "Client: I... I feel sorry for her. She was so scared, so alone. I wish I could go back and tell her it wasn't her fault, that she did the best she could.",
    "Therapist: That's a compassionate perspective. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, release? Like I've finally let out something I've been holding in for decades.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a glass of water. And maybe just to sit quietly for a bit.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's still painful, but it feels... manageable now.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. We'll end our session here, but remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Margaret. Take care of yourself, and we'll continue next week."
