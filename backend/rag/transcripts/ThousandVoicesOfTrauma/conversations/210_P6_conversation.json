    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to give it a go.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about it is making me a bit tense.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the moment you were imprisoned during the natural disaster.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) It was pitch black. The earthquake had knocked out all the power. I could hear screams and crashing sounds all around me. The prison walls were shaking, and I thought they might collapse at any moment. I was trapped in my cell, and I couldn't see anything. The fear was... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's jumped up to a 7. My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: The guards were shouting, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. Everything was chaos. I could smell dust and... something burning. I was certain I was going to die there, forgotten in that cell. My cellmate was praying loudly next to me, and I remember thinking how useless that seemed.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still at a 7, maybe edging towards an 8. My palms are sweating now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to go on forever. I heard what sounded like part of the building collapsing nearby. There was this moment of absolute terror when I thought our cell block was next. I started pounding on the cell door, screaming for help. But no one came. I felt so helpless, so small. It was like being buried alive.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's... it's a 9 now. I can feel my chest tightening. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay. After what felt like hours, the shaking finally stopped. But then the aftershocks started. Each one made me think it was starting all over again. The uncertainty was torture. We were left there for days before any help came. No food, barely any water. The smell was... it was horrible. People were hurt, sick. I thought we'd been abandoned.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 again. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are really tense, especially in my shoulders. But my breathing is steadier now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: When help finally came, I almost couldn't believe it. The relief was... indescribable. But then came the guilt. So many others hadn't made it. Why did I survive when they didn't? That thought has haunted me ever since.",
    "Therapist: SUDS check?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start wrapping up. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's still painful to remember, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today. Well done."
