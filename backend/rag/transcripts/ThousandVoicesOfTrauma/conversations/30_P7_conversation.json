    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the moment you were imprisoned?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It was a cold morning. I remember the sound of heavy boots approaching my cell. The guard's keys jingled as he unlocked the door. I felt my heart racing, wondering what was going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As the door creaked open, I saw two guards standing there. Their faces were stern, emotionless. They ordered me to stand up and put my hands behind my back. I felt so helpless, so small. The cold metal of the handcuffs bit into my wrists as they led me out of the cell.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) The hallway seemed endless. Other prisoners watched silently as I was marched past their cells. I could feel their eyes on me, some pitying, others blank. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows. I... I remember thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They took me to a small, windowless room. The air was thick and stale. There was a single chair in the center, and they forced me to sit. One guard stood by the door while the other circled around me like a predator. I felt so exposed, so vulnerable. My hands were shaking, and I could barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Pauses, takes a shaky breath) The guard started asking questions. His voice was cold, threatening. I couldn't understand everything he said - my mind was racing. But I knew they wanted information I didn't have. Every time I said I didn't know, he would slam his hand on the table, making me jump. I felt so alone, so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Hours passed, or maybe it was just minutes. Time seemed to stand still in that room. My throat was dry, my body ached from sitting in that hard chair. They wouldn't let me use the bathroom or give me water. I felt utterly powerless, like I was nothing more than an object to them. The neglect, the dehumanization... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (Voice cracking) I... I feel drained. Reliving this is hard. But there's also a strange sense of relief, like I'm finally letting out something I've kept bottled up for so long. It's painful, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult to talk about, but I know it's important. I remember when they finally took me back to my cell. The relief of being alone again was immense, but so was the fear of what would happen next. I curled up on my cot, trying to make myself as small as possible. The silence was deafening after hours of interrogation.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. It's hard, but I feel like I need to get this out. In my cell, I tried to focus on memories of my family, of happier times. But the fear and uncertainty kept creeping back in. I didn't know how long I'd be there, what they would do to me next. Every sound, every footstep in the hallway made me tense up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Keep going at your own pace.",
    "Client: The nights were the worst. The darkness seemed to close in around me. I'd lie awake for hours, replaying the day's events in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently. The guilt of not being able to protect my family, of not being there for them, was overwhelming. I felt like I had failed them, even though I knew deep down that this wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember it wasn't your fault. You're very courageous.",
    "Client: (Nods slowly) I know that now, but back then... it was hard to believe. The days blurred together. The constant state of fear and alertness was exhausting. I started to lose hope, to wonder if I'd ever see the outside world again. But somehow, I managed to hold onto a tiny spark of resilience. I think it was the thought of my family that kept me going, the hope that someday I'd be reunited with them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful source of strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's strange, but talking about it like this, it feels like I'm starting to take some of the power back. The memories are still painful, but they don't seem to have the same grip on me as before. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You've done remarkably well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm making progress. Is this... is this what healing feels like?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's journey is unique, but yes, this can be part of healing.",
    "Client: I see. It's a strange feeling, but I think I'm ready to face more of these memories. Not all at once, of course, but... I feel like I can do this now. I want to work through this, to not let these experiences control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. We'll continue at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment, to help me navigate through these difficult memories. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful about the future.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of your progress. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but also... liberating in a way. I feel exhausted, but also a bit stronger. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself. We'll continue next time."
