    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That memory of the hostage situation, it's so vivid now. I can still feel the cold metal of the gun pressed against my temple. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can hear the shouting, smell the sweat and gunpowder. My hands are actually shaking. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Thanks. It's just... God, I thought I was going to die that day. I keep thinking about my family, my wife and kids. The thought of never seeing them again... it's unbearable. And then there's this anger, you know? Anger at the people who did this, anger at myself for being helpless.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, punch something? But then I remember how powerless I felt, and the anger just turns into this deep sadness. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" What did I do to deserve this? And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I survived, and others... others didn't. There's this voice in my head saying I should be over this by now, that I'm weak for still being affected. But then another part of me knows that's not true. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal reactions. How else has this experience affected you?",
    "Client: I... I find it hard to trust people now. I'm always on edge, always looking over my shoulder. Simple things like going to the bank or even a crowded market make me anxious. I used to love traveling for work, but now the thought of being away from home terrifies me. It's like the world isn't safe anymore, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: Honestly? Sometimes I don't cope well. I've been drinking more than I should, just to numb the memories. I know it's not healthy, but it helps me sleep. During the day, I throw myself into work. It's the only time I feel... normal, I guess. But then I come home, and I'm distant with my family. I can see the worry in my wife's eyes, and I hate that I'm causing her pain too.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you need to heal?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to forget it all, but I know that's not possible. I think I need to find a way to live with what happened without letting it control me. I want to feel safe again, to enjoy life like I used to. And I want to be present for my family. They've been so supportive, and I feel like I'm letting them down.",
    "Therapist: That's a good insight. How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by talking about it more? As painful as this is, I do feel a bit lighter after discussing it. And perhaps finding ways to feel more in control of my surroundings? I don't know. It's just... it's hard to imagine ever feeling truly okay again.",
    "Therapist: Small steps. What's one thing you can do this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I could try talking to my wife about how I'm feeling. Not everything, but... something. And maybe cut back on the drinking. It's not really helping, just... postponing things.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe there's a way through this. It's scary, but... I want to try. For myself, for my family. I can't let those people who held us hostage keep controlling my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll work on this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that. It's not going to be easy, but I'm willing to put in the work. I want my life back. I want to feel like me again. And talking about it... it's hard, but it does help. I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: Remember, recovery isn't linear. Take it day by day.",
    "Client: Yeah, you're right. I need to remember that. It's just... some days are so hard, you know? But I guess that's part of the process. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but it's not easy. Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, and then something triggers me, and I'm right back where I started. It's frustrating.",
    "Therapist: What helps you get through those tough moments?",
    "Client: Honestly? Sometimes it's just remembering to breathe. My wife taught me this grounding technique - focusing on five things I can see, four I can touch, three I can hear, two I can smell, and one I can taste. It helps bring me back to the present. And... talking to you helps. Having someone who understands, who doesn't judge... it means a lot.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you find our sessions helpful. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I've been trying to get back into my hobbies. I used to love painting, but I hadn't touched a brush since... since it happened. Last week, I finally set up my easel again. I didn't paint anything great, but just the act of creating something... it felt good. Like I was reclaiming a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How did it make you feel?",
    "Client: It was... bittersweet, I guess. There was joy in doing something I love again, but also sadness for all the time I've lost. And a bit of anger too, that this trauma took that away from me for so long. But mostly, it felt like... hope. Like maybe I can get other parts of my life back too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to try reconnecting with some old friends. I've been isolating myself, and I miss them. It's scary, the thought of explaining where I've been, what I've been through. But I think it might be worth it. And maybe... maybe I can start planning a small trip with my family. Nothing big, just a weekend away. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Baby steps. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been... intense. Draining, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. I know we've still got a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get through this. It's scary, but... I'm ready to keep working on it.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really, thank you. I know I've said it before, but having this space to talk, to process everything... it means more than I can express. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little excited? To reclaim my life, to feel like myself again. It's going to be hard work, but I think I'm finally ready for it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I think that's good. I feel... drained, but in a positive way. Like I've done something important. Thank you again for your time and patience. I'll try to keep working on the things we've discussed between now and our next session. It's not easy, but... I'm committed to this process. To getting better."
