    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Margaret?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I saw my father hit my mother... it's bringing up so many emotions I've tried to bury for years. I feel shaky, and my heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. I had forgotten how loud it was when his hand connected with her face. It was like a crack of thunder in our tiny kitchen. And my mother's face... the shock and pain in her eyes. I felt so helpless, so small. I wanted to do something, but I was frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Terrifying, really. But also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? For so long, I've tried to pretend it never happened. Facing it head-on like this, it's painful, but it's also like... like I'm finally acknowledging my own history.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Margaret.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but I feel a bit lighter. Like I've been carrying this heavy secret for so long, and now that I've spoken it aloud, it's not quite as crushing. Don't get me wrong, it's still awful, but... it's no longer just mine to bear silently.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've always had trouble with loud noises. They make me jumpy, anxious. I see now that it probably stems from that moment. And my anxiety... I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. I guess I've been living in that state of fear for decades.",
    "Therapist: That's an important connection you've made.",
    "Client: It is, isn't it? And you know, I've always had trouble trusting men. I've never really understood why, but now... it makes sense. My father was supposed to protect us, but instead, he was the source of fear and pain. It's no wonder I've struggled with relationships.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about these realizations?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's sadness for the little girl I was, anger at my father, and a strange sense of relief. Like, now that I understand where these feelings come from, maybe I can start to work on them. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. This awareness is a crucial step.",
    "Client: That's encouraging to hear. I've lived with this anxiety for so long, I almost can't imagine life without it. But going through this memory, as hard as it was, has made me realize how much it's affected me. I want to work on this, to heal. I don't want that moment to define the rest of my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How can we support that?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep facing these memories. It's terrifying, but I can see now that avoiding them hasn't helped. And maybe... maybe I need to learn some techniques to manage my anxiety when it flares up. Do you think that would help?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas, Margaret. We'll definitely work on that.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm scared, but I'm also... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can move past this. It won't be easy, but I'm ready to try. Is that... is that normal? To feel scared and hopeful at the same time?",
    "Therapist: It's very normal. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've spent so long feeling weak because of how this has affected me. But maybe... maybe facing it is its own kind of strength. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to be able to enjoy my retirement, to be present for my family without always being on edge. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: It is possible. We'll work towards that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your help. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. I'm ready for our next session, whatever it brings. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to this process now. I want to heal, for myself and for my family."
