    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that animal attack... it felt so real again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The sound. The growling. It was so loud, so... threatening. I could almost feel the hot breath on my skin. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How did reliving that memory feel different today?",
    "Client: Well, it's still terrifying, but... I noticed I could breathe through it this time. Like, I knew I was safe here, even though my body was reacting. That's new.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you make sense of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm starting to separate the past from the present? It's hard to explain. The fear is still there, but it's not consuming me entirely.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I... I thought about how I survived. Not just the attack, but everything after. The hospital, the recovery, even... even the sexual abuse. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does that connect to your recovery?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... stronger, I suppose. Like, if I could get through that, maybe I can get through this too. The depression, the PTSD... all of it.",
    "Therapist: Mhm. What challenges do you anticipate moving forward?",
    "Client: I'm worried about the nightmares coming back. And... I don't know if I'm ready to face the sexual abuse memories yet. That feels like a whole other monster.",
    "Therapist: That's valid. How might you cope with those concerns?",
    "Client: Um... I could try those grounding techniques we talked about. And maybe... maybe I need to remind myself that I'm not alone anymore. I have support now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How else has this process impacted you?",
    "Client: It's weird, but I feel more... present? Like, before, I was always on edge, waiting for the next bad thing. Now, I catch myself actually enjoying moments sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What do you attribute that change to?",
    "Client: I think... facing the memories head-on has helped. It's like, the more I confront them, the less power they have over me. It's exhausting, but... liberating too.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're noticing that. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep going. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. Maybe... maybe we could start addressing the sexual abuse memories soon? Not today, but... soon.",
    "Therapist: That's brave. How can we prepare for that?",
    "Client: I think I need to build up my support system more. Maybe reconnect with some old friends, or join a support group? And definitely keep practicing these coping skills.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For sticking with me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but... I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm pretty drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important. I'll keep working on my coping strategies this week.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
