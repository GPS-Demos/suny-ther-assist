    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's a lot to process, honestly. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? It's strange. Reliving those cult experiences, it brings back so many conflicting emotions. On one hand, I feel angry and betrayed, but on the other, there's this weird sense of nostalgia for the community I once thought I belonged to. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: (pauses) I think... the manipulation. How they used my depression against me, you know? They promised a sense of purpose, a family. And for a while, it felt good. But now, looking back, I can see how they exploited my vulnerabilities. It's like they saw my pain and instead of helping, they used it as a tool to control me. That realization... it's both painful and empowering.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... (takes a deep breath) I also felt stronger this time. Like I could look at the memory without being completely overwhelmed by it. I kept reminding myself that I'm not there anymore, that I've moved on. It's still hard, but it feels... I don't know, more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. I guess it is, isn't it? (chuckles softly) You know, one thing that really hit me during the exposure was how much my experience in the cult has affected my current relationships, especially with my wife. I've always struggled with trust, and now I can see why. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone to try and manipulate me again. But my wife... she's been so patient. I think I owe it to her, and to myself, to work on this.",
    "Therapist: How might you apply what you've learned?",
    "Client: (thoughtfully) I think... I need to be more open with her about my fears and insecurities. And maybe... maybe I need to start trusting my own judgment more. The cult made me doubt myself, but I'm not that person anymore. I've grown, I've learned. I think it's time I start giving myself more credit for that.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, John.",
    "Client: Yeah, it feels important. And you know what? This process, as difficult as it is, it's helping me understand my depression better too. I've always seen it as this separate thing, this illness that just happened to me. But now I'm starting to see how it's all connected - the trauma, the trust issues, the depression. It's like... like I'm finally seeing the whole picture, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that new perspective feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I guess? Scary too, but mostly liberating. It's like I've been trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing, and now I'm finally seeing what the whole picture looks like. It doesn't fix everything, but it helps me understand why I feel the way I do sometimes. And that understanding... it gives me hope. Hope that I can work through this, that I can get better.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful analogy, John. What's next for you?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I think... I want to keep pushing forward with this therapy. It's hard, but I can see the progress now. And maybe... maybe it's time I start talking to my wife more about all of this. She's always been supportive, but I've kept so much bottled up. I think sharing this journey with her might help both of us. And... (pauses) I've been thinking about maybe reaching out to others who've left cults. Not immediately, but someday. If I can use my experience to help someone else, maybe that can be a way to reclaim some of what was taken from me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal.",
    "Client: Yeah, it does. (smiles softly) Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel... I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength, John. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's good for today. It's a lot to process, but I'm feeling... okay. Better than okay, actually. Thank you again. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, John."
