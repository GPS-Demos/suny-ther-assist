    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving that hostage situation... it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to forget it, and now you're asking me to remember every detail? I'm not sure I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I completely fall apart? And... I'm embarrassed about how I reacted during the situation. I feel like I should have been stronger or done something differently. Plus, I've been having more nightmares lately just thinking about this session.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. These concerns are common. How do you think facing this memory might help?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long, but the memories still pop up at the worst times. It's affecting my work, my relationships... everything, really. If there's a chance this could help me move past it, I want to try. But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's discuss what to expect during the exercise.",
    "Client: Okay, that would be helpful. What exactly will we be doing? And how long will it take? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed and not being able to stop once we start.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory in detail. You'll describe it aloud while I guide you. It typically lasts about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That sounds like a long time to be reliving such a horrible experience. Will you be able to help me if I start panicking? And what if I can't remember everything clearly?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause if needed. Just share what you remember.",
    "Client: Alright, I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand why we're doing this. It's just... I've spent so much energy trying to avoid these memories. The idea of voluntarily bringing them up is really challenging.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to face this is a big step. How can I support you during the exercise?",
    "Client: Could you maybe remind me to breathe if I start getting too worked up? And... I think it would help if you could reassure me that I'm safe now. Sometimes when I think about what happened, I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide your breathing and remind you of your safety. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that covers it. I'm still scared, but I'm also hopeful that this might help. It's been so long since I've felt like myself. If this can help me get back to some kind of normal life, it's worth trying.",
    "Therapist: Your hope is encouraging. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll take it step by step. You're safe here."
