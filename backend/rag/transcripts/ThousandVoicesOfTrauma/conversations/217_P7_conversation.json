    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about today's session. I know we're going to talk about the car accident again, and it still makes me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the moment just before the accident.",
    "Client: Alright. I was driving home from the grocery store. It was a sunny afternoon, and I remember feeling relaxed. The radio was playing softly in the background. I was thinking about what to make for dinner that night. Then... then I saw it. A car coming from the opposite direction, swerving wildly. It was... it was all happening so fast. My heart started racing, and I gripped the steering wheel tighter. I tried to move to the side of the road, but there wasn't enough time. The car... it just kept coming towards me. I could see the driver's face, he looked... he looked terrified. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" The sound of screeching tires filled my ears, and then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The impact... it was like nothing I've ever experienced before. The sound of metal crushing, glass shattering. My body jerked forward, but the seatbelt held me back. I felt a sharp pain in my chest and neck. Everything was spinning. I could smell gasoline and burnt rubber. I was... I was so scared. I couldn't move. I couldn't think. I just sat there, frozen, staring at the crumpled hood of my car. I could hear people shouting outside, but it all sounded muffled, like I was underwater. I... I remember looking at my hands, they were shaking uncontrollably. I tried to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my fingers wouldn't cooperate. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again. My heart is racing, and I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. After what felt like forever, someone came to my window. It was a man, he looked worried. He was saying something, but I couldn't understand him at first. Then I realized he was asking if I was okay. I tried to nod, but my neck hurt so much. I started crying. I couldn't stop. The man, he stayed with me until the paramedics arrived. They had to use some tool to get me out of the car. I remember the sound of it, this loud mechanical noise. It made everything feel even more surreal. When they finally got me out, I saw the other car. It was... it was completely wrecked. There were so many people around, police, firefighters, onlookers. I kept asking about the other driver, but no one would tell me anything. I was terrified that I had... that I had killed someone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: They put me on a stretcher and into the ambulance. The lights were so bright, and the siren was so loud. I felt like I was in a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from. In the hospital, everything was a blur of tests and questions. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if anyone had told them what happened. I felt so alone and scared. The doctor finally came and told me I had whiplash and some bruising, but otherwise, I was okay. Then... then they told me about the other driver. He had been drinking. He... he didn't make it. I felt... I don't know. Relieved that I was alive, but also guilty. Why did I survive when he didn't? It didn't seem fair. I know it wasn't my fault, but sometimes I still wonder if there was something I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's still so hard. Every time I get in a car now, I feel panicked. I see potential accidents everywhere. I can't relax. I keep reliving that moment of impact over and over again. Sometimes I have nightmares about it. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I can't breathe. It's affecting my whole life. I don't want to go out anymore. I'm afraid to drive. I feel like I'm not the same person I was before the accident. How do I move past this? How do I stop being so afraid all the time?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I hope so. It's just so overwhelming sometimes. I want my old life back. I want to be able to drive without panicking. I want to sleep through the night without nightmares. I want to stop feeling guilty for surviving. Is that... is that possible? Will I ever feel normal again?",
    "Therapist: With time and effort, yes. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I'm trying. It's just... it's so hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm getting better, and then something small will trigger me, and I'm right back in that moment. Like the other day, I heard a car horn, and suddenly I was back in the accident. My hands started shaking, and I couldn't catch my breath. My husband had to talk me through it. He's been so supportive, but I know it's hard on him too. I feel like I'm letting everyone down. My kids, they don't understand why mommy can't drive them to school anymore. I feel like I'm failing them. And I know... I know the other driver's family must be suffering so much more than me. I'm alive, and their loved one isn't. How do I reconcile that? How do I move forward without feeling this crushing guilt?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. Keep working through them.",
    "Client: I'm trying. I really am. It's just... it's a constant battle. Every day, I have to consciously remind myself that I'm safe, that it's over. But it doesn't feel over. It feels like it's still happening, like I'm still stuck in that moment. And I'm so tired. Tired of being afraid, tired of feeling guilty, tired of not being able to live my life the way I used to. I want to be strong for my family, but sometimes it feels like I'm barely holding it together. I put on a brave face, but inside, I'm screaming. I just want it to stop. I want to be able to close my eyes without seeing the accident. I want to be able to hear a car without flinching. I want to be me again. Do you think... do you think that's possible? Can I ever really get past this?",
    "Therapist: It's possible. You're stronger than you realize.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I... I want to believe it. I'm trying to believe it. It's just hard when I feel so weak and scared all the time. But I know I have to keep trying, for my family if nothing else. They need me. And I need to find a way to live with this, to not let it control me anymore. I'm just... I'm so tired of feeling this way. Every day feels like a struggle. But I'm here, right? I'm talking about it. That's... that's progress, isn't it? Even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making significant progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. That... that means a lot to hear. Sometimes it's hard to see any progress when you're in the middle of it all. But you're right, I am here. I am talking about it. And even though it's painful and scary, I'm not running away from it anymore. I guess that is progress. It's just... it's a long road, isn't it? There's no quick fix for this. I have to keep working at it, keep facing these memories and fears. It's exhausting, but... but I want to get better. I want to be able to drive my kids to school again. I want to be able to go to the grocery store without having a panic attack. I want to sleep through the night without nightmares. I want my life back. And I'm willing to do the work to get there. It's just... it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel sometimes. But I'm trying. I'm really trying.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and for your support. It means a lot to me. I know this isn't easy, but I'm grateful for your help. I'll try to keep working on this between sessions. Maybe... maybe I'll try that breathing exercise you taught me when I start feeling overwhelmed. And I'll keep reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's over. It's hard, but I'm going to keep trying. Thank you again for everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."

I'm so tired of feeling this way. Every day feels like a struggle. But I'm here, right? I'm talking about it. That's... that's progress, isn't it? Even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes?",

And even though it's painful and scary, I'm not running away from it anymore. I guess that is progress. It's just... it's a long road, isn't it? There's no quick fix for this. I have to keep working at it, keep facing these memories and fears. It's exhausting, but... but I want to get better. I want to be able to drive my kids to school again. I want to be able to go to the grocery store without having a panic attack. I want to sleep through the night without nightmares. I want my life back. And I'm willing to do the work to get there.

Maybe... maybe I'll try that breathing exercise you taught me when I start feeling overwhelmed. And I'll keep reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's over. It's hard, but I'm going to keep trying. Thank you again for everything."
