    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit nervous, I guess. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. It's hard enough dealing with my chronic pain, and now I have to relive the emotional abuse and my illness? I'm worried it might be too much.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your worries?",
    "Client: Well, I'm afraid that thinking about the abuse and my illness might make my pain worse. And... I'm scared of how I might react. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? I'm already struggling with my studies because of everything, and I don't want to fall behind even more.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How about we discuss the purpose and process?",
    "Client: Okay, that might help. But... can you explain how this won't make things worse? I mean, I'm living with my parents, and they don't really understand what I'm going through. If this affects me badly, I don't know how I'll cope at home.",
    "Therapist: Good question. Imaginal exposure helps by...",
    "Client: (interrupting) I'm sorry, but how can reliving trauma possibly help? It seems counterintuitive. And with my South Asian background, we're often taught to just 'get over' things. My parents already think I'm overreacting about the abuse. This seems like the opposite of what they'd advise.",
    "Therapist: I hear your cultural concerns. This approach...",
    "Client: (sighing) I see. It's just... my girlfriend has been really supportive, but I don't want to burden her more. And with my chronic pain, I'm worried this might trigger a flare-up. How can we prevent that?",
    "Therapist: We'll monitor your pain closely and adjust as needed.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. But what exactly will happen during the exposure? Will I have to describe everything in detail? What if I can't remember parts of it?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event, and we'll guide you through gaps.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now. How long will this process take? And what kind of support will I have between sessions?",
    "Therapist: Sessions vary. I'm available between appointments if needed.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm ready to try, even though I'm scared. Can you tell me what to expect during the actual exposure?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm trying to be brave, but it's hard. This abuse and my illness have affected me so much. I sometimes wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. But I'm here, and I'm willing to try. What's the first step?"
