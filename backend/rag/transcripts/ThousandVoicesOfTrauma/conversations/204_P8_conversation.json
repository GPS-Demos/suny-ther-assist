    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of foggy at the same time. My heart's still beating pretty fast.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to put into words. I keep seeing flashes of that day, you know? The looks on their faces, the way they laughed. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. And I feel... I don't know, kind of small? Like I'm shrinking into myself. It's weird, but I can almost smell the hallway from that day. That musty school smell mixed with cleaning products.",
    "Therapist: You're very in touch with those sensations. How about your thoughts?",
    "Client: God, my thoughts are all over the place. Part of me is angry, like really angry. I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did they single me out?\" But then there's this other voice saying, \"Maybe I deserved it. Maybe there's something wrong with me.\"",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused, I guess? And sad. Really sad. It's like I'm that kid again, feeling so alone and out of place. I remember wanting to disappear, to just blend into the walls so no one would notice me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult.",
    "Client: Yeah, it was. And you know what's messed up? A part of me still feels that way sometimes. Like I don't belong, like I'm always going to be the outsider.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you now?",
    "Client: It... it holds me back, I think. I'm always second-guessing myself, always worried about what others might be thinking. It's exhausting, you know? Always being on guard, always trying to prove that I belong.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my parents. How I never told them what was happening. I was so ashamed, and I didn't want to disappoint them. But now I wonder if things could have been different if I had spoken up.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful reflection. How does it feel to consider that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet, I guess. Part of me feels angry at myself for not speaking up, for letting it continue. But another part understands that I was just a kid, trying to cope the best way I knew how.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit calmer now, actually. My breathing's slowed down. But there's still this heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Can you describe that heaviness?",
    "Client: It's like... it's like all the words I never said, all the pain I pushed down, it's all sitting there in my chest. But it doesn't feel as suffocating as it used to. It's there, but I can breathe around it, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I think... I think maybe it means I'm starting to process it all? Like, it's still painful, but I'm not running from it anymore. It's like I'm finally letting myself feel it, acknowledge it.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Scary, but also kind of... liberating? Like, for so long I've been trying to pretend it didn't affect me, that I was over it. But now, facing it head-on, it's like I'm reclaiming a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has shaped me. Not just the negative stuff, but... it's made me more empathetic, more aware of others who might be struggling. I don't know if that's a silver lining or what, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does recognizing that impact you?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I wish I didn't have to go through all that to learn those lessons, you know? But at the same time, I'm kind of proud of who I've become in spite of it all. It's like, they tried to break me, but here I am, still standing.",
    "Therapist: That's a strong statement. Tell me more about that feeling.",
    "Client: It's like... for the first time, I'm seeing my strength. Not just as a victim who survived, but as someone who's actively working to heal and grow. I'm not just passively existing anymore, I'm... I'm fighting back, in my own way.",
    "Therapist: I see. What does that fight look like for you?",
    "Client: It's showing up here, for one. Facing these memories, even though it's hard. It's pushing myself to connect with others, to be vulnerable. It's reminding myself every day that I deserve to take up space, that my voice matters.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like, if I can face this and come out the other side, maybe I can face anything. It's scary, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We're almost out of time. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for helping me navigate through all this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll pick this up next session."
