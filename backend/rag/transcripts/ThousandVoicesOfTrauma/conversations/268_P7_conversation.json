    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in the hospital after the accident. The lights were so bright, and there was this constant beeping from the machines. I remember feeling scared and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The doctors were talking, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. It felt like they were talking about me, not to me. I tried to move, but I was in so much pain. I kept thinking about how I ended up there, about the traffickers...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I remember one of the nurses. She was kind. She held my hand and told me everything would be okay. But I didn't believe her. How could anything be okay after what I'd been through?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The pain was unbearable. Every time I moved, it felt like my whole body was on fire. And the worst part was, I knew that even if I recovered, I had nowhere to go. The traffickers knew who I was, where I was from...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I felt so helpless, so trapped. Even in the hospital, I was afraid they would find me. I couldn't sleep without nightmares. Every time someone entered the room, I'd flinch, thinking it might be them coming to take me away again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes another deep breath) The doctors kept asking me questions about what happened, but I was too scared to tell them the truth. I made up a story about an accident, but I could see in their eyes that they didn't believe me. I felt so ashamed, like it was all my fault somehow.",
    "Therapist: Remember, none of this was your fault.",
    "Client: I know that now, but back then... I just felt so broken. Like I'd never be whole again. The physical pain was terrible, but the emotional pain was even worse. I kept replaying everything in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the days went by, I started to feel a little better physically, but mentally... I was a mess. I couldn't stop thinking about what had happened, what might happen if they found me. I was terrified of being discharged because I had nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's hard, but... I think I'm okay. Talking about it... it's difficult, but it also feels like I'm taking some of the power back, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, but it's different now. Like the memory doesn't have as much control over me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. It's exhausting, but in a way, I feel lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's wrap up."
