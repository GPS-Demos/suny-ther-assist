    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my whole body is buzzing. My hands are shaky, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. The memory... it felt so real, like I was right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. I keep thinking about my sister's face when I last saw her. Before she... before she was taken. I feel so guilty. I should've done something, anything. Maybe if I'd been more aware, more protective... God, I miss her so much.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really painful. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel this overwhelming sense of helplessness. It's like I'm drowning in it. I know logically that there wasn't much I could've done, but emotionally... it's crushing. And then there's this anger bubbling up. At the traffickers, at the world, at myself. It's all mixed up with this deep, aching sadness.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to punch something. But then it fades, and I just feel empty. Like a hollowed-out shell. It's exhausting, this constant swing between rage and despair.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you make of these intense emotions?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess they're a sign of how much I loved her. How much I still love her. But it's also terrifying. Sometimes I worry that if I let myself fully feel everything, I'll just... shatter. Like I'll never be able to put myself back together again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really overwhelming. How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: It's hard. Some days are better than others. I try to focus on my studies, but then I'll see something that reminds me of her and it all comes flooding back. I've been trying to write about it, like you suggested. It helps sometimes, but other times it feels like I'm just reopening the wound.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's it like to share these experiences here?",
    "Client: It's... strangely relieving. Scary, but also like I'm finally letting out this breath I've been holding for years. There's a part of me that feels guilty for talking about it, like I'm betraying her somehow. But another part feels like maybe... maybe this is how I start to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I want to heal, I do. But there's this fear that healing means forgetting, and I never want to forget her. And then there's this voice in my head saying I don't deserve to heal, that I should suffer because I couldn't save her. It's all so tangled up.",
    "Therapist: I hear that conflict. What would your sister want for you?",
    "Client: She... she'd want me to be happy. She was always looking out for me, even though she was younger. God, just thinking about her smile... it hurts, but it's a good hurt, you know? Like remembering her is keeping a part of her alive.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How can you honor her memory while still moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by living the way she would've wanted me to? By trying to find joy in life, even though it feels impossible sometimes. And maybe... maybe by doing something to help others who've been through similar experiences. I don't know if I'm strong enough for that yet, but the thought of it feels... right, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful path. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, I think. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's still there, waiting for me to pick it up again, but for now... for now, I can breathe a little easier. Thank you for... for creating this space where I can talk about her.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how I can honor her memory. And maybe... maybe start looking into ways I could help others. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick up there next time. How will you take care of yourself until then?",
    "Client: I'll try to do some of those grounding exercises we talked about. And maybe... maybe I'll start a memory book for her. Writing down all the good times we had. It might hurt, but I think it could be healing too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
