    "Therapist: Welcome, Aisha. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... honestly pretty nervous, Dr. Chen. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving my experiences in prison during the war... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart? I've been using substances to cope, and I'm afraid this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe just reassure me that I won't lose control? And maybe explain why we need to do this? It feels counterintuitive to deliberately bring up painful memories.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. This process helps by reducing the power these memories hold over you. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess... what exactly will happen during the exposure? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be guiding me through it? And how long will it last? Sorry, that's a lot of questions.",
    "Therapist: No need to apologize. You'll recount the event while I guide you. It'll last about 30-45 minutes. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. But I appreciate knowing what to expect. I'm still scared, but I think I'm ready to try. Can we take breaks if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. Your bravery is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay... yes, let's do this. I'm trying to remind myself that this is part of getting better. It's just... hard to face these memories head-on, you know? But I trust you, Dr. Chen. And I want to get better. I want to be able to live my life without constantly looking over my shoulder or turning to substances to numb the pain. So... I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Remember, you're in control. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's start. I'm taking deep breaths like we practiced. It's helping a little. I keep reminding myself that I'm here, in your office, not back there. That I'm safe now. It's just... it feels so real sometimes, you know? But I'm ready. I want to face this. I want to reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Close your eyes when you're ready. We'll begin slowly."
