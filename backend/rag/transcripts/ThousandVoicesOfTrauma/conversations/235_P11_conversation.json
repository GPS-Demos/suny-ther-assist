    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's been years since I've allowed myself to revisit those memories of being imprisoned as a child. The fear, the confusion, the helplessness... it all came rushing back. I could almost smell the damp concrete and hear the clanging of metal doors. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The isolation, I think. I was just a boy, barely 10 years old, and suddenly I was alone in this cold, dark cell. I remember curling up in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. I kept thinking, \"What did I do wrong? Why am I being punished?\" The uncertainty was almost worse than the confinement itself.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that feel today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt that same tightness in my chest that I experienced back then. But... there was also something different this time. I realized that I'm not that helpless child anymore. I survived it. I'm here, I'm safe, and I have people who care about me now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it relate to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've always struggled with feeling trapped or panicky in small spaces. Even elevators can be challenging sometimes. And I often wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm back in that cell. But going through this memory today, I felt more... in control, I suppose. Like I could observe the memory without being completely consumed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What helped you feel that control?",
    "Client: I think... it was the breathing exercises we've been practicing. When I felt myself getting overwhelmed, I focused on my breath, just like you taught me. It helped me stay present and remember that I was just revisiting a memory, not actually reliving it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I might be able to face some of my fears more directly now. Maybe I could try using an elevator for short trips, knowing I have these tools to manage my anxiety. And perhaps... perhaps I can start talking to my wife about this part of my past. I've always kept it hidden, but I'm beginning to see that sharing might actually help.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great next steps. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. I realized that a lot of my anxiety about my grandchildren's safety might be connected to this experience. I'm always so worried about them being hurt or taken away. But they're growing up in a different world, a safer one. Maybe I can work on loosening those reins a bit, for their sake and mine.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's challenging, no doubt. But for the first time in decades, I feel like I'm making real progress. There's a glimmer of hope that I might not always be controlled by these memories. I'm... I'm ready to keep going, even if it's difficult. I want to reclaim the parts of myself that I lost in that cell.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For helping me face this. I know it's not easy for you to hear these things either, but I'm grateful for your guidance and support. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your hard work is paying off. See you next week?",
    "Client: Absolutely. I'll be here, ready to take on the next challenge. Thank you again, doctor."
