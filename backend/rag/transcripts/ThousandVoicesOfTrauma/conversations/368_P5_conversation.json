    "Therapist: Hello Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hey Dr. Martinez. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the hospital situation lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure exercise.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that mean? I'm not sure I like the sound of it.",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting the traumatic memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisiting it? You mean... like, talking about it in detail? I don't know if I can do that without completely falling apart. Just thinking about being trapped in that hospital room during the hostage situation makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Yes, but we'll go at your pace. It helps reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: I get that, but... how? Won't talking about it just make everything worse? I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. And with my depression already making things difficult, I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel anxious. Your bravery is commendable.",
    "Client: Thanks, I guess. But I still don't understand how this is going to help. What if I panic? What if I can't handle it? I'm already struggling with my classes and my relationship because of all this.",
    "Therapist: We'll take breaks if needed. I'll guide you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... that's somewhat reassuring. But what exactly will we be doing? Do I just start talking about what happened? And how long will this take? I have a big exam coming up, and I'm already behind in my studies.",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on one part of the memory. You'll describe it in present tense.",
    "Client: Present tense? Like it's happening right now? That sounds terrifying. I can already feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it. How do you know this won't make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Research shows it helps process trauma. Your reactions are normal.",
    "Client: I see. I trust you, Dr. Martinez, but this is really scary for me. I haven't even told my girlfriend all the details of what happened. How personal do I need to get? There are some parts that are... really hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Share what you're comfortable with. We'll build trust gradually.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. I guess I'm just worried about losing control. When I think about being in that room, hearing the gunshots outside, not knowing if I'd see my family again... it's overwhelming. How do I deal with those feelings?",
    "Therapist: We'll practice coping strategies. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That helps a little. I know you're trying to help me, and I want to get better. It's just... this is a big step. Do you really think I'm ready for this? Sometimes I feel like I'm barely holding it together as it is.",
    "Therapist: Your progress suggests you're ready. We'll go slow.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll try my best. But if it gets too much, can we stop? And... this might sound silly, but can I bring something comforting with me? Like a stress ball or something?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Comfort items are welcome. Ready to begin?",
