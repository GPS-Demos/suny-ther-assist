    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, to be honest. The idea of revisiting that hostage situation makes me very uneasy. I've spent years trying to forget it. Why do we need to bring it all back up?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. This process helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Are you ready to try?",
    "Client: I suppose so, but I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I panic or can't handle it? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm wondering how detailed I need to be. There are parts of that day that are still so vivid, but others are hazy. And... I'm afraid of feeling as helpless as I did back then. It reminds me of some difficult experiences from my childhood too.",
    "Therapist: Share what you can comfortably. Your feelings are normal. How can I help you feel safer?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Maybe... could we have a code word if I need to stop? And could you remind me that I'm here, in the present, not back there? Sometimes I lose track of where I am when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's use \"pause\" as our code word. I'll ground you regularly. Anything else?",
    "Client: That helps, thank you. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It's strange, you know. I've lived a long life, seen so much, but this one event still has such power over me. I hope this really will help.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can significantly reduce PTSD symptoms. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. Let's do this. I'm nervous, but I trust you. And I suppose after all these years, it's time to face this head-on. I just hope I can get through it without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. Remember, we're here in a safe space. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Let's get this over with. Where should I start? The beginning of that day, or when the hostage-takers first entered the building?"
