    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling pretty nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting that dog attack... it's making my stomach churn. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving the experience will be too overwhelming. What if I panic? Or what if it makes my anxiety worse? I've finally gotten to a place where I can function day-to-day without constant fear, and I'm scared this might set me back.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting the memory might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've heard exposure can reduce the power traumatic memories have over you. But it's hard to imagine how reliving something so terrifying could be beneficial. It goes against every instinct I have.",
    "Therapist: You're right about the benefits. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: I think I'd feel better if we could have a signal or a word I could use if things get too intense. And maybe if you could remind me that I'm safe here, in the present. It's easy for me to get lost in the memory and forget where I am.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use \"pause\" as our signal. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Having a glass of water nearby would be good. And maybe if we could open a window? Sometimes when I'm anxious, I feel like I can't breathe. Oh, and is it okay if I bring in a small stress ball to hold? I find having something to fidget with helps ground me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Those are excellent ideas. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, and I want to get better. Can you walk me through what's going to happen one more time? Just so I'm prepared.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll start with a relaxation exercise, then you'll describe the event in detail...",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. And you'll be guiding me through it, right? I'm worried I might freeze up or not know what to say. This isn't something I talk about... ever, really. It's been bottled up for so long.",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. Remember, you're in control. Shall we start with some deep breaths?",
    "Client: Alright, I can do that. *Takes a deep breath* I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
