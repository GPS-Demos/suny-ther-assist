    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mr. Lee. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand it's part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the combat experience we discussed.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. The air is thick with dust and the smell of gunpowder. I can hear the distant sound of explosions and gunfire. My unit is moving through a small village...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: We're advancing cautiously. Suddenly, there's a loud crack, and I see one of my men fall. I... I freeze for a moment. My heart is racing, and I can't breathe. I know I need to move, to help him, but my legs won't work...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally snap out of it and rush to him. There's so much blood... I start applying pressure to the wound, yelling for a medic. The gunfire is getting closer. I can smell the metallic scent of blood mixed with dust and sweat. I'm terrified, but I can't show it. I have to stay strong for my team...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* The medic arrives, and we're trying to stabilize him. I can hear the bullets whizzing past us. I'm so focused on keeping him alive that I almost forget about the danger we're in. Then I hear a scream... another one of my men is hit. I... I don't know what to do. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: I... I'm trying. We manage to get both men to cover, but the first one... he doesn't make it. I can still see his face, the life draining from his eyes. I failed him. I failed them all...",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I feel a wave of guilt and shame washing over me. My throat feels tight, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel. You're processing this memory.",
    "Client: *voice breaking* I know, but it hurts so much. The guilt, the fear, it's all coming back. I can hear the chaos around us, smell the gunpowder and blood. I feel like I'm suffocating...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here, now.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. The firefight continues, but we manage to call for an evacuation. As we're waiting, I'm holding the hand of the wounded soldier, trying to keep him calm. I can see the fear in his eyes, and I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I still feel tense and anxious, but the overwhelming panic has subsided somewhat.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The helicopter arrives, and we load the wounded. As we take off, I look down at the village, now partly in flames. I feel a mix of relief, guilt, and anger. I'm glad to be leaving, but I feel like I'm abandoning those we couldn't save...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I feel drained, both emotionally and physically. There's a heaviness in my chest, but the intense anxiety has lessened.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: *sighs* Exhausted, but... maybe a little relieved? It's still painful, but talking through it... it helps somehow. I feel less alone with these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Well done today."
