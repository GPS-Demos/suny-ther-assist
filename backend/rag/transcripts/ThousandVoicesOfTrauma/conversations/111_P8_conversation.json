    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm back there, you know? I can still hear the roar of the engines, feel the vibrations. My heart is racing, Dr. Thompson. It's been years, but it feels so fresh.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's the guilt. My grandson... he was so excited about his first plane ride. I remember his little face pressed against the window as we took off. And then... (voice breaks) the alarms, the screaming. I couldn't protect him. I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden. How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a weight on my chest. I can barely breathe sometimes. My hands are shaking now, just like they did when I was trying to unbuckle his seatbelt. I failed him. I failed everyone.",
    "Therapist: Maria, you're here now. You're safe. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away from these memories, but another part knows I need to face them. It's just so hard. I keep seeing their faces - my grandson, my daughter, the other passengers. They haunt me, Dr. Thompson.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by facing this. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. Angry at the airline, at the pilots, at myself. Why did I agree to take that trip? Why couldn't I save them? And then I feel guilty for being angry because I survived and they didn't. It's a never-ending cycle.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly freeing. I've been so focused on the sadness and guilt that I haven't let myself feel angry. But I am. I'm furious that this happened, that lives were lost, that my family was torn apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid feeling. What else?",
    "Client: I'm scared. Scared that I'll never be able to move past this, that I'll always be defined by this tragedy. I used to be so different - outgoing, adventurous. Now I can barely leave the house without panicking. I miss who I used to be.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. How do you see your future now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me hopes that by working through this, I can find some peace. Maybe even honor their memory by living fully again. But it feels impossible right now. Every step forward feels like a betrayal.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How might they want you to live?",
    "Client: (long pause) They... they would want me to be happy, I think. My grandson was always so full of joy. He wouldn't want me to suffer like this. But it's so hard to let go of the guilt.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to honor their memory while also healing?",
    "Client: I suppose... it would mean finding a way to live that incorporates what happened without being consumed by it. Maybe... maybe I could volunteer with other survivors or work with children. Something to give meaning to what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful idea. How does thinking about that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet. There's a glimmer of hope there, but also sadness. It's like I'm acknowledging that life goes on, which feels both right and wrong at the same time. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a complex emotion. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that I've been so focused on that day that I've forgotten to remember the good times. My grandson's laugh, my daughter's smile. It hurts to think about, but... it's also comforting in a way.",
    "Therapist: Those memories are important too. How can you incorporate them?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could start a memory book. Write down all the happy moments we shared. It might help me remember that there was more to their lives than just how they ended.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful idea. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, honestly. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a small piece of the burden I've been carrying. It's still there, but... I don't know. Maybe there's hope after all.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today, Maria. What do you need to take care of yourself now?",
    "Client: I think... I need some quiet time. Maybe I'll call my sister later. She's always been supportive, even when I push everyone away. And... I might look at some old photos. It'll be hard, but maybe it's time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. This isn't easy, but... I'm glad I'm doing it. I just hope I can keep moving forward, even when it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I have a lot to process. But... I'll be back next week. Thank you for helping me face this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
