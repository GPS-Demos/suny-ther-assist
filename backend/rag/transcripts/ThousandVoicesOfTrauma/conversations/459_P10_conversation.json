    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of going back there. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I'm waiting in line to deposit a check. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I can feel goosebumps on my arms. There's soft music playing overhead, but I can barely hear it over the chatter of other customers.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. I spin around and see three men in ski masks bursting through the front doors. One of them fires a shot into the ceiling, and everyone starts screaming. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might explode.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm paralyzed with fear. My legs feel like jelly, and I can't move. One of the men is shouting for everyone to get down on the ground. I... I can't breathe. Oh God, I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... okay. I'm on the ground now. The cold tile floor is pressing against my cheek. I can smell the cleaning solution they use, mixed with the acrid scent of gunpowder.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 8. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the men is walking between us, collecting phones and wallets. His boots are right in front of my face. I can see a scuff on the left one. He... he kicks me in the ribs and demands my wallet. I fumble to get it out of my pocket, my hands shaking so badly I can barely grip it.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm humiliated. Scared. Angry. But mostly, I feel helpless. Like a child. I hand over my wallet, and he moves on. I can hear sobbing from somewhere behind me, and hushed whispers of prayer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The police arrive outside. I can hear sirens, see flashing lights through the windows. The robbers start panicking. They're yelling at each other, arguing about what to do. One of them grabs me by the collar and yanks me to my feet.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. My legs are shaking so badly I can barely stand. He's pressing a gun to my temple, and I can feel the cold metal against my skin. He's using me as a human shield, backing towards the rear exit.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, John. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* The robber is dragging me outside now. The sunlight is blinding after the dimness of the bank. There are police cars everywhere, officers with guns drawn. I can hear them shouting, but it's all a blur. My ears are ringing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's threatening to shoot me if they don't let him go. I can feel his arm around my neck, choking me. I'm gasping for air. I... I think I'm going to die. Oh God, I don't want to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: Right... right. Um, suddenly there's a loud bang. For a second, I think I've been shot. But then the arm around my neck loosens, and I'm falling to the ground. There's a flurry of activity around me - shouting, running footsteps. Someone's helping me up, asking if I'm okay. But I can't speak. I'm just... numb.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Relieved? Shocked? It's like I'm watching it all happen to someone else. My body feels disconnected from my mind.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 7 now. My heart's still racing, but I'm starting to calm down a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: They're leading me to an ambulance now. I can see my reflection in the window - I look pale, disheveled. There's a paramedic checking me over, asking questions, but I can barely focus on what she's saying. I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did nothing wrong. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilty, I guess. And angry. Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm sitting in the back of the ambulance now. They've given me a shock blanket, but I can't stop shivering. A police officer is trying to take my statement, but I can barely string two words together. Everything feels surreal, like a bad dream I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how close I came to dying. How easily it could have gone the other way. And I'm angry - at the robbers, at myself for being so helpless, at the world for being so cruel.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I'm feeling a bit more grounded, but still shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: They're taking me to the hospital now for a check-up. The ride is a blur. I keep expecting to wake up and find out it was all a nightmare. At the hospital, there's a flurry of activity - doctors, nurses, more police. They're all asking questions, poking and prodding. I feel like a specimen under a microscope.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Exposed. Like I've lost control of everything. I just want to go home and hide under the covers, but I can't. They keep telling me I'm in shock, that it's normal to feel this way, but it doesn't help.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What happens next?",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, they finally let me go home. My sister comes to pick me up. She's crying, hugging me tightly, but I can't feel anything. It's like I'm watching everything from a distance. When we get to my apartment, I just sit on the couch, staring at the wall. I can't sleep, can't eat. Every time I close my eyes, I see that gun pressed against my head.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. Like I've run a marathon. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've finally faced it head-on instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4 now. I'm feeling more grounded, more present.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done very well today, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It... it wasn't easy, but I'm glad I did it. I feel like I've taken back a little bit of control, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. I'm pretty wiped out, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up.",
    "Client: *inhales and exhales slowly* Okay. I'm feeling a bit more settled now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll process this more next time.",
    "Client: Alright. Thanks, Doc. I... I appreciate your help with this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. You've shown great courage today."
