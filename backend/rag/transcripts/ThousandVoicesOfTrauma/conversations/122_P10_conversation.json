    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is really anxious about digging into all of this again. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? Yeah, 40.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in our old apartment. It's dark, and I can hear muffled shouting from the living room. I'm in my bedroom, trying to block it out, but the walls are so thin. I can make out my mom's voice, she sounds scared. And then there's my dad, he's yelling... God, his voice is so loud.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I'm trying to make myself as small as possible on my bed. I want to disappear. I can feel myself shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's happening now?",
    "Client: There's a crash. I think... I think he threw something. My mom screams, and I can hear her crying. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I can't move. I'm such a coward.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I hear footsteps coming towards my room. Heavy footsteps. My dad. I'm panicking now, trying to pretend I'm asleep. The door flies open, and the light from the hallway floods in. I can smell the alcohol on his breath from across the room.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's yelling at me now. Calling me useless, a disappointment. Says I should have never been born. I'm trying not to cry, but I can feel the tears coming. My chest feels so tight, like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He grabs my arm, yanks me out of bed. His grip is so tight, I know it'll leave bruises. He's dragging me to the living room, and I can see my mom huddled in the corner, her lip is bleeding. There's a broken vase on the floor. I want to run to her, but I can't. I'm too scared.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My arm hurts where he grabbed me. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's shoving me towards my mom, telling me to look at what I've done. That it's my fault she's hurt. I don't understand how it could be my fault, but I believe him. I always believe him. I'm crying now, apologizing over and over.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know. It just feels so real. Um, my mom is trying to stand up now. She's telling my dad to leave me alone, that I didn't do anything wrong. But that just makes him angrier. He turns on her again, starts screaming in her face. I can see the veins in his neck, his face is so red.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm just standing there. Frozen. I want to help her, to do something, but I can't move. I feel so helpless, so weak. And then... and then he hits her. Hard. She falls back against the wall, and there's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* Okay. I'm... I'm here. But God, I can still see it so clearly.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I finally snap out of it. I run to my mom, try to help her up. My dad is just standing there, looking shocked. Like he can't believe what he's done. And then he starts crying, apologizing. It's always like this. He hurts us, then he's sorry. But it never stops.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling towards your dad in this moment?",
    "Client: I hate him. I'm so angry, but I'm also scared. I want to protect my mom, but I don't know how. I feel... I feel powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high. Maybe 80? My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm helping my mom to the bathroom now. We're locking the door. I can hear my dad outside, still apologizing, begging us to come out. My mom is crying quietly as I help clean the blood off her face. I feel so... lost. Like I should know what to do, but I don't.",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could do in that moment?",
    "Client: I wish I could make it all stop. Take my mom and run away. But we have nowhere to go. No one to help us. We're trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We stay in the bathroom for hours. Eventually, my dad goes to bed. The house gets quiet, but it's not peaceful. It's like... like the calm before another storm. I help my mom to her bedroom, but I can't sleep. I sit outside her door all night, just in case.",
    "Therapist: How old are you in this memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm 14. But I feel so much older. Like I've aged years in just one night.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden for a 14-year-old. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. Angry. It's like... like all these emotions are swirling inside me, and I don't know how to process them.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 65 now. Still high, but... but I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start bringing you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I... I think I need that.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your body in the chair.",
    "Client: *deep breath* I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after exposure. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks. It was hard, but... but I'm glad we did it. I didn't think I could talk about it like that.",
    "Therapist: You showed a lot of strength. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... I hope this helps. I want to stop feeling so haunted by all of this.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I think I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care of yourself. We'll discuss this more next session.",
    "Client: Alright. Thanks again. I'll... I'll see you next week."
