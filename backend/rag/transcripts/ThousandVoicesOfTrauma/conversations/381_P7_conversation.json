    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes. My heart's already racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm back in my apartment. It's early morning, and I hear a low rumbling sound. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then the whole building starts to shake. Picture frames are falling off the walls, and I can hear glass breaking. I'm frozen in place, unsure of what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The shaking is getting more intense. I can hear people screaming outside. I'm trying to move, but my legs feel like lead. I'm gripping the doorframe, watching as my bookshelf topples over. Books and knick-knacks are scattered everywhere. I'm thinking, \"This is it. The building's going to collapse.\"",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I finally manage to move. I'm stumbling towards the front door, but the floor is moving so much it's like trying to walk on a boat in rough seas. I reach for the doorknob, but my hand is shaking so badly I can barely grasp it. When I finally get the door open, I see my neighbors in the hallway, looking just as terrified as I feel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing the scene.",
    "Client: We're all trying to get down the stairs, but it's chaos. People are pushing and shoving. I nearly fall several times. The stairwell is dark, and I can hear the building creaking and groaning around us. I'm convinced that at any moment, the whole thing is going to come down on top of us.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: We finally make it outside, and the scene is surreal. There's dust everywhere, and I can see cracks in the pavement. Car alarms are blaring, and there's this constant sound of sirens in the distance. People are crying and hugging each other. I'm standing there, barefoot in my pajamas, feeling completely lost and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The aftershocks start coming. Each time the ground shakes, I feel this wave of panic wash over me. I'm looking around at the buildings, wondering which ones might fall. I spot a woman searching frantically for her child, and it hits me how easily it could have been so much worse. I feel guilty for being relieved that I'm alone, that I don't have to worry about anyone else.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: As the hours pass, the reality of the situation starts to sink in. I have no idea if my apartment is safe to return to. I don't know where I'm going to sleep or what I'm going to eat. My phone isn't working, so I can't even call anyone for help. I feel completely cut off and alone, even though I'm surrounded by people. It's like the whole world has been turned upside down, and I don't know how to cope with it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job processing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Reliving it brings back a lot of those same feelings of fear and helplessness. But at the same time, there's a part of me that feels stronger now, knowing that I survived it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it helps to get it out. There's so much more to the experience - the days and weeks that followed, trying to put life back together. But just focusing on those first few hours... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* You're right, I do need that. It's strange how vivid the memories still are, even after all this time. I can still feel the ground shaking sometimes when I close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I think what scares me most is how unprepared I was. I never thought something like that could happen to me. It's made me hyper-vigilant about safety, always looking for exits, always having an emergency bag packed. Sometimes I wonder if I'm being paranoid, but then I remember how quickly everything changed that day.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It's not easy to talk about, but I know it's important. I want to be able to think about it without feeling overwhelmed by fear and anxiety. I want to feel like I have control over my life again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back. But I'm committed to working through this. I don't want this experience to define me or limit my life. I want to be able to enjoy things again without constantly worrying about when the next disaster might strike.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we conclude for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've made some progress. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
