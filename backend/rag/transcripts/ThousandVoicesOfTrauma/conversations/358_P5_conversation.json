    "Therapist: Mrs. Chen, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, but I'm feeling quite nervous. What exactly does imaginal exposure involve? I've been dreading this part of the therapy.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel nervous. Imaginal exposure means revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Oh dear, that sounds quite frightening. I've spent so long trying not to think about that terrible plane crash. The idea of purposely remembering it makes my heart race. Are you sure this is necessary?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. This process helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand why we're doing this. It seems counterintuitive to deliberately think about something so upsetting. Won't it just make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Actually, facing the memory helps your brain process it. It may be uncomfortable initially, but it typically reduces anxiety long-term. How does that align with your goals?",
    "Client: I see. Well, my goal is to feel less anxious and to stop having nightmares about the crash. If this can help with that, I suppose I'm willing to try. But I'm still scared. What if I become overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your support. I've always prided myself on being strong, but this trauma has shaken me to my core. It's hard to feel so vulnerable at my age. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You'll recount the memory in present tense, focusing on sensory details. I'll guide you through. Any questions?",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. Will I feel like I'm back in that moment? I'm worried about panicking. And what kind of sensory details do you mean? The sounds of metal crushing and people screaming are what haunt me the most.",
    "Therapist: Those concerns are valid. We'll start slowly, and you're in control. Sensory details help processing. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I'll need all the help I can get. I've been using deep breathing when I feel anxious, but I'm not sure if that will be enough for this. Do you have any other suggestions?",
    "Therapist: Deep breathing is excellent. We can also use grounding techniques. Would you like to practice some now?",
    "Client: That would be helpful, thank you. I'm willing to try anything that might make this easier. I just hope I can get through this without falling apart. You'll be here the whole time, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here supporting you throughout. Your resilience is remarkable. Shall we start with a grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do that. I'm feeling a bit calmer knowing you'll be guiding me through this. It's still scary, but I trust you. I've come this far in my therapy, and I want to keep making progress. I'm ready to give this a try.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is inspiring. Let's begin with a simple grounding technique. Are you comfortable?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm as comfortable as I can be, given the circumstances. What should I do first? I'm trying to keep an open mind, even though part of me still wants to run away from all of this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room. Can you name them?"
