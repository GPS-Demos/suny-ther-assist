    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? In that moment when my husband... when he... (voice trembles) I can still hear the sound of his voice, so angry and loud. My heart is racing even now.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I feel like I'm on high alert, like I need to be ready to... to protect myself or run away. It's silly, isn't it? He's not even here anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's not silly at all. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I leave sooner?\" And then I feel guilty because he's gone now, and I shouldn't speak ill of the dead, right? But then I remember how scared I was, how small he made me feel. It's all so confusing. I loved him, but I was also terrified of him. How is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: It's a complex situation. How do these conflicting feelings affect you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me doubt myself. I wonder if I'm remembering things correctly. Was it really as bad as I recall? But then I remember the bruises, the constant fear... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's like I'm stuck between the past and the present. I want to move on, but these memories keep pulling me back.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that pull between past and present?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, you know? I'll have a good day, laugh with my grandkids, and then suddenly, something triggers a memory. It could be a loud noise or even just a certain smell, and I'm right back there, feeling helpless and scared. It's like... like I'm living two lives sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting these memories impact your view of yourself?",
    "Client: (long pause) It's... complicated. On one hand, I feel stronger now. I survived, didn't I? But then there's this voice in my head that says I should have been smarter, braver. Maybe if I had stood up to him more... But I know that's not fair. I did what I had to do to survive. It's just... hard to silence that critical voice sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What would you say to that critical voice now?",
    "Client: (sighs) I'd tell her... that she did her best. That surviving was an act of bravery in itself. It wasn't her fault. She... I... deserved better. (voice breaks) It's still hard to believe that sometimes, you know? That I deserved better. After years of being told you're worthless, it sticks with you.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to say that out loud?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Scary, but also... empowering? Like I'm finally standing up for that younger version of myself. But it also makes me sad. I wish I could go back and tell her it wasn't her fault, that she didn't deserve any of it.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that younger version of you needs to hear most?",
    "Client: (tearfully) That she's strong. That she'll make it through. That one day, she'll be surrounded by people who love her and treat her with kindness. That the fear won't last forever. I wish... I wish I could just give her a hug and tell her it's going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that conversation make you feel?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet. There's a warmth in my chest, thinking about comforting her. But there's also this deep ache, you know? For all the years lost, all the pain endured. It's like... like I'm mourning for her, for the life she could have had if things had been different.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that mourning process?",
    "Client: It's... it's necessary, I think. I've spent so long trying to be strong, to push everything down and just keep going. But allowing myself to feel sad for what happened, to really acknowledge the pain... it's hard, but it also feels like a release. Like I'm finally giving myself permission to feel all of it.",
    "Therapist: How does this release compare to how you've dealt with these feelings before?",
    "Client: It's different. Before, I'd try to ignore the feelings, push them away. I thought that was being strong. But now... now I'm realizing that facing them head-on, that's real strength. It's terrifying sometimes, like I might get swept away by all the emotion. But there's also... I don't know, a sense of relief? Like I'm finally dealing with something I've avoided for so long.",
    "Therapist: What does this new approach mean for your healing journey?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I think... I think it means I'm finally on the right path. It's not easy, and some days are harder than others. But I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better, to have more compassion for myself. And maybe... maybe that's the first step towards really healing, you know? Accepting what happened and learning to be kind to myself despite it all.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It's scary, and sometimes I worry about what other painful memories might surface. But I also feel... hopeful? Like maybe, just maybe, I can work through this and come out stronger on the other side. I want to keep going. I owe it to myself... to that younger version of me... to see this through.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about setting boundaries. I've always struggled with that, even with my family now. I want to learn how to assert myself without feeling guilty. Is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... in a good way? Like I've done something important. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone really hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
