    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy to go back to that moment, you know? The memory of being in that hospital room, surrounded by all those machines... and then hearing about the police brutality incident on the TV... it's like it all came crashing back.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The... the helplessness. I felt so powerless in that hospital bed, and then seeing those images on the news... it was like a double whammy of feeling completely out of control. I couldn't help myself, and I couldn't help those people being mistreated either.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the monitors. And then when the news report came on, I felt this surge of anger and fear. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you coping now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to use those breathing exercises we practiced. It helps a little, but I still feel on edge. It's like my body is ready for something bad to happen at any moment. I keep thinking about my late wife and how she used to help me through these moments. Being alone now... it makes it harder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well with the techniques. What else helps?",
    "Client: Talking about it, actually. As scary as it is to revisit these memories, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm finally addressing something I've been avoiding for so long. And knowing that you're here, listening... it makes me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I've been avoiding hospitals altogether. Even for routine check-ups, I make excuses. And watching the news... I just can't do it anymore. It's like I'm constantly trying to protect myself from anything that might trigger these feelings. But I know that's not healthy, especially at my age. I need to be able to take care of my health without this... this fear controlling me.",
    "Therapist: Understood. What would you like to work on next?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to find a way to feel more in control when I'm in medical settings. Maybe we could work on some strategies for that? And also, I'd like to find a way to engage with current events without feeling so overwhelmed. I used to be quite involved in community issues, you know? I miss that part of myself.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mixed bag, really. Some days I feel like I'm making real strides, like today. Talking about this memory was tough, but I did it. Other days, though, I feel like I'm right back where I started. But I'm trying to remind myself that healing isn't linear, as you've said. It's just... it's hard being patient with myself sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great self-awareness. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm realizing that facing these memories head-on, as difficult as it is, is actually empowering in a way. It's like... it's like I'm reclaiming parts of myself that I thought I'd lost. And maybe, just maybe, if I can face this, I can start to rebuild other areas of my life too. Maybe I can even find ways to contribute to addressing issues like police brutality, instead of just feeling helpless about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe I'll call my son. I've been avoiding talking to him about all this, but... maybe it's time to open up a bit. He's been worried about me, and I think sharing some of what I'm going through might actually bring us closer.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I can find a way to live with these experiences without letting them control me. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thank you again."
