    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the memory of your imprisonment. Remember to stay present in the moment. What's your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm closing my eyes. My SUDS is about a 6 right now. I can see the small, dark cell. The air is thick and musty. I hear footsteps echoing down the hallway...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The footsteps are getting louder. My heart is racing. I'm pressed against the cold wall, trying to make myself invisible. The door creaks open, and I see a silhouette... I'm trembling...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The guard enters. His face is stern, emotionless. I can smell cigarette smoke on his uniform. He barks an order, but I can't understand the language. I'm frozen in fear, unsure what to do...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. My palms are sweaty, and I feel nauseous. The room seems to be spinning a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I... I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Try to stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The guard grabs my arm roughly. I'm being dragged out of the cell. The hallway is blinding after the darkness. Other prisoners are watching silently as I pass. I feel so ashamed, so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My legs feel weak, like they might give out.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep breathing. What do you see next?",
    "Client: We're entering an interrogation room. There's a single chair in the center, a bright light above it. The guard pushes me into the chair. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to an 8. I'm still scared, but I'm starting to feel a bit numb.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: An officer enters the room. He's carrying a file. He starts asking questions, but I can't focus on the words. I'm staring at his hands, wondering if he's going to hit me. My mouth is so dry...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8. I'm feeling more panicked again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The officer leaves the room. I'm alone, but the bright light is still on. Time seems to stand still. I don't know if it's day or night. I'm so tired, but I can't relax...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Drained. Hopeless. My SUDS is about a 6 now. I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're almost done. Can you describe how it ends?",
    "Client: Eventually, the guard returns. He roughly pulls me to my feet and leads me back to my cell. As the door closes behind me, I collapse onto the thin mattress. I'm relieved it's over, but terrified it will happen again...",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel... I don't know. Sad. Angry. Relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. Let's start grounding. Open your eyes and look around the room.",
    "Client: *opens eyes, takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something heavy.",
