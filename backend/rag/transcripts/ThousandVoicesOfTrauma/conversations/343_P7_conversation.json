    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some difficult things, and I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It's just... every time I think about that night, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Alright. So, it was late, maybe around 11 PM. I was walking home from a friend's house. The streets were quiet, too quiet...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I heard shouting from an alley nearby. I froze. Two men were arguing, their voices getting louder and more aggressive. I wanted to run, but my feet wouldn't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Then I saw one of them pull out a knife. It glinted in the streetlight. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst out of my chest. I couldn't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The man with the knife lunged forward. There was a scream, so loud and terrifying. I saw blood... so much blood. I wanted to help, to do something, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. (starts breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Okay... The injured man stumbled out of the alley. He looked right at me, his eyes wide with fear and pain. I'll never forget that look. He collapsed on the sidewalk, and I finally found my voice to scream for help.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaky. My hands are trembling. But... I also feel a bit lighter, like a weight has been lifted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Is it? Because sometimes I feel guilty. I keep thinking, what if I had intervened? Could I have prevented it?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You were protecting yourself.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. And now, with my marriage falling apart, it feels like everything is crumbling. Like I can't protect anyone, not even myself.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I've been avoiding these memories for so long, pushing them down. But they always find a way to surface, especially now with the stress of the divorce.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance is common. You're making progress by facing it.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... the violence I witnessed that night, it makes me feel so vulnerable. And now, facing a future alone, without my partner... it's bringing up all those feelings of helplessness again.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel safe again. If I'll ever be able to walk down a street at night without my heart racing, or if I'll be able to trust someone enough to build a new relationship after my divorce.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're taking important steps.",
    "Client: I hope so. Because right now, it feels like I'm stuck in that moment, forever watching that man stumble out of the alley, forever feeling that paralyzing fear. And with the divorce... it's like I'm losing my safe haven, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. We'll work on coping strategies.",
    "Client: I'd like that. I want to feel in control again, to not let this trauma and the end of my marriage define me. But it's so hard some days. The nightmares, the anxiety... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great resilience. Let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm nervous about delving deeper, but I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll build on that.",
    "Client: I appreciate your guidance. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment, especially now when I feel so alone in my personal life. I'll try to hold onto this feeling of hope until our next session.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. See you next week, Maria."
