    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but actually facing those memories of my deployment and then my illness... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the medical tent. It's hot, so hot. The air feels thick and heavy. I can smell antiseptic and... something else. Something sickly sweet. Oh god, it's the smell of infection.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There's a commotion. People are rushing in. I hear shouting, \"Medic! We need a medic!\" I'm trying to get up, but I feel so weak. My head is pounding, and I'm sweating profusely.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... about a 60, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm trying to focus, but everything's blurry. I realize I'm the patient now. Someone's leaning over me, checking my vitals. They're saying something about a fever, but their voice sounds far away. I'm... I'm scared. What's happening to me?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I can't be sick. Not now. My team needs me. But I can't even lift my head. I feel so useless, so vulnerable. This isn't how it's supposed to be. I'm supposed to be the one helping others.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Remember your breathing techniques. You're doing great, Sarah.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... The doctor is talking to me now. He's saying something about an infection, that it's spread. I need to be evacuated. No, no, I can't leave. I try to argue, but I can barely speak. My throat feels like it's on fire.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Frustration. Fear. Anger. I feel... betrayed by my own body. I've trained so hard, and now this? It's not fair. I... I think I'm crying. I never cry, but I can feel tears on my face.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. Let those emotions out.",
    "Client: They're moving me now. Onto a stretcher. The movement makes me nauseous. I can hear the chopper outside. It's so loud, adding to the chaos in my head. I'm being carried out, and the sunlight is blinding. I squeeze my eyes shut.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Maybe 85? My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor here in the room.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm in the chopper now. The vibrations are making everything worse. I can barely focus on what the medic is saying. Something about sepsis. I know it's bad. Really bad. I might die. Oh god, I might actually die here.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my husband. Will I ever see him again? And my parents... they'll be devastated. I promised them I'd come home safe. I feel like I'm letting everyone down. I'm not ready to die. Not like this, not from some stupid infection.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 90, maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Take some slow, deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathing slowly* I... I can feel the IV in my arm. They're pumping me full of antibiotics, but I still feel like I'm on fire. Every part of me hurts. I drift in and out of consciousness. Time doesn't make sense anymore. I hear snatches of conversation - \"critical condition,\" \"organ failure.\" I want to fight, but I'm so tired.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I think I'm hallucinating now. I see faces, people from my unit. But they're not really there. I try to reach out, but my arms won't move. I feel so alone, so scared. This isn't how a soldier is supposed to die. Not in a hospital bed, weak and helpless.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need someone to hold my hand. To tell me it's going to be okay. But there's no one. Just machines beeping and doctors rushing around. I feel so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can, Sarah. You're here now, you're safe. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *gasping* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm in and out of consciousness. Days are blurring together. I hear doctors talking about how I'm fighting, how I'm strong. But I don't feel strong. I feel broken. I drift off again, and when I wake up, something's changed. The pain is... less. I can focus a little more.",
    "Therapist: That's it. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: A doctor is smiling at me. He's saying something about turning a corner. The fever's breaking. I... I think I'm going to live. But I don't feel relieved. I feel... angry. Angry that this happened, angry that I was so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. How's your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 80? I'm shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I start to recover, I realize how much this has changed me. I'm not the same person who arrived in that war zone. I feel... broken. Weak. I know I'll be sent home, and a part of me is relieved, but another part feels like a failure. I've let my team down. I've let myself down.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to yourself in that moment now?",
    "Client: I... I'd tell myself that it's not my fault. That getting sick doesn't make me weak. But it's hard to believe that. Even now, it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally and physically. But... also a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for too long.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now. Still there, but not overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done amazing work today, Sarah. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm opening my eyes now. The room looks... brighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How are you feeling now that we're back in the present?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you've done. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I am. It was hard, but I did it. I actually did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breath* I'm here. I'm safe. It's over.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll process this more next time. For now, just be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
