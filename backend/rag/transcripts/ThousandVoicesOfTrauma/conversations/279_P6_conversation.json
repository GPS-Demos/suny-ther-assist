    "Therapist: Welcome back, Carlos. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Ramirez. I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 right now. Just thinking about revisiting the accident makes me tense up a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe that day.",
    "Client: Alright... It was a sunny afternoon. I was driving home from work, looking forward to seeing my family. The traffic was heavy, but moving. I remember the radio was playing some Latin pop song... Then suddenly, I heard screeching tires and a loud crash behind me. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a car spinning out of control, heading straight for me. I tried to swerve, but there was nowhere to go. The impact was... God, it was so loud. Metal crunching, glass shattering. My car spun around, and I felt this sharp pain in my neck and back. I was so disoriented...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I... I remember the smell of gasoline and burning rubber. People were shouting, car horns blaring. I was trapped in my seat, and panic just washed over me. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. All I could think about was my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I can't catch my breath. My whole body is tense, and I'm feeling dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I heard sirens in the distance. Someone was at my window, telling me help was coming. But I was in so much pain, and so scared. I kept thinking about my kids, my wife... The paramedics had to cut me out of the car. I remember the sound of the metal being torn apart...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My heart is racing, and I feel nauseous. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's stay here for a moment.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying to breathe... The paramedics were talking to me, but their voices sounded far away. They put a neck brace on me and lifted me onto a stretcher. The pain was excruciating. I remember looking up at the sky as they wheeled me to the ambulance, thinking how beautiful it was, and how close I came to never seeing it again...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8? I still feel shaky, but the nausea is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Thanks... In the ambulance, I started to feel a little calmer. The EMT was so kind, holding my hand and telling me I was going to be okay. I remember focusing on her voice, trying to stay conscious. When we got to the hospital, everything became a blur of doctors, tests, and worried faces...",
    "Therapist: How about now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I'm feeling less panicked, but still anxious. My muscles are starting to relax a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. How do you want to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need a break. This is intense, but I feel like I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take a moment. You've shown incredible strength today."
