    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's always a bit daunting, you know? But I'm here, and I want to work through this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40 right now. Just thinking about revisiting those memories has my stomach in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. Whenever you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm back in our house. It's late afternoon, and the sun is casting long shadows through the windows. I can hear the TV in the background, some game show. My partner is in the kitchen, I think they're making dinner. The air feels... heavy. Tense.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you notice about your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tight. Really tight. And my heart is starting to race a bit. I'm... I'm anticipating what's coming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I walk into the kitchen. The smell of garlic and onions is strong. My partner turns to look at me, and I can see the anger in their eyes. God, it's like a physical thing, you know? I start to say something about work, but they cut me off.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Scared. Really scared. And... angry too, I guess. I'm so tired of walking on eggshells.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: They start yelling. About money, about me being late, about... everything. Their face is red, and I can see the vein in their forehead pulsing. I try to explain, to calm them down, but it's like talking to a brick wall.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 65 now. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay. They're getting closer to me now. I can smell the alcohol on their breath. I back up, but I hit the counter. There's nowhere to go. They grab my arm, hard enough to leave bruises. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is the moment it becomes physical.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see the rage in their eyes. I hear the blood rushing in my ears. I feel... trapped. Terrified. But also... something else. A spark of defiance, maybe?",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I push them away. Hard. They stumble back, surprised. For a moment, we just stare at each other. The air feels electric. Then they lunge at me again, but this time I'm ready. I dodge, and they crash into the counter.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. But also... powerful, in a way? Like I'm finally standing up for myself.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe 55 now?",
    "Therapist: Interesting. What happens next?",
    "Client: They turn to face me, and I can see the shock in their eyes. Maybe even a flicker of fear. I find my voice and I say, \"Don't you ever touch me like that again.\" My voice is shaking, but I mean every word.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to say that?",
    "Client: Terrifying. But also... liberating? Like I'm reclaiming a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens after you speak?",
    "Client: They... they back off. Just a little, but it feels like miles. We stand there, staring at each other, both breathing hard. The silence is deafening. Then, finally, they turn and walk out of the kitchen. I hear the front door slam a few moments later.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Shaken. Relieved. Scared about what might happen when they come back. But also... proud? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a valid feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I slide down to the floor, my back against the cabinets. I'm shaking all over now. I sit there for... I don't know how long. Just breathing. Trying to process what just happened.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 40 again. Talking through it... it's hard, but it's also helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What do you do after sitting on the floor?",
    "Client: I... I get up. Slowly. My legs feel wobbly. I walk to the living room and sit on the couch. The TV is still on, that same game show. It feels surreal, like nothing has changed but everything has.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: That I can't do this anymore. That something has to change. I'm... I'm scared, but I'm also angry. Angry that it's come to this.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do they make you want to do?",
    "Client: They make me want to leave. To pack a bag and just... go. But I'm also terrified of what might happen if I do.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling in these situations. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I call a friend. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial the number. When they answer, I just... break down. All the emotions I've been holding back just come pouring out.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to reach out for help?",
    "Client: Scary. Embarrassing, even. But also... like a weight is lifting. Like I'm not alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What happens after the call?",
    "Client: My friend offers to come over. I hesitate at first, but then I say yes. While I'm waiting, I start packing a bag. Just essentials. It feels... final. Like I'm closing a chapter.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 30. Talking through it, making a plan... it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's continue. What happens when your friend arrives?",
    "Client: They knock on the door, and for a second, I freeze. Afraid it might be my partner. But then I hear their voice, and I rush to let them in. As soon as I see them, I just... collapse into their arms. I'm crying again, but it feels different now. Like relief.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to have that support?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. In a good way. Like I'm not alone in this fight anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What happens next?",
    "Client: We sit on the couch, and I tell them everything. All the things I've been hiding, all the fear and pain. It's like a dam breaking. They listen, they hold my hand, they tell me it's not my fault.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing your story affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's freeing. Scary, but freeing. Like I'm taking back control of my narrative.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What decision do you make?",
    "Client: I decide to leave. To go stay with my friend for a while. As we're walking out the door, I feel... lighter. Scared, but lighter. Like I'm walking towards something better.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. How do you feel now, thinking back on that day?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. There's still pain and fear. But there's also pride. I stood up for myself. I got out. I survived.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 20. Talking through it like this... it's helping me see how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... good. Like I've faced something big and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: *inhales and exhales slowly* Thank you. This... this helps more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you're stronger than you know. We'll pick up here next session."
