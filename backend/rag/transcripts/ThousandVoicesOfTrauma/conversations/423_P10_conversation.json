    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Been thinking about this all week. Part of me wants to dive in, but another part... it's like my body's telling me to run.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in the Humvee. The air's thick with dust, and I can taste it. We're on patrol outside Fallujah. It's hot, God, it's so hot. My uniform's sticking to me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The radio's crackling. Johnson's driving, and I can see his knuckles are white on the wheel. We're all tense. Something doesn't feel right.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we turn a corner, and suddenly there's a loud bang. My ears are ringing. I smell burning rubber and... oh God, is that blood?",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, John. You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The Humvee's stopped. There's shouting, but it sounds muffled. I reach for my rifle, my hands are shaking. I can see Miller, he's not moving. There's blood on his face.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. But there's no time to think. I have to act. I'm yelling at Johnson to move, to get out of the vehicle. My training's kicking in, but part of me just wants to curl up and hide.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're scrambling out. The heat hits me like a wall. I can hear gunfire now, sharp cracks cutting through the air. I'm dragging Miller out, praying he's still alive. His blood is on my hands, it's warm and sticky.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe. But God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: We're behind the Humvee now. I'm trying to assess Miller's wounds. There's so much blood. I can hear Thompson returning fire. The air smells like gunpowder and fear. I'm yelling for a medic, but I don't know if anyone can hear me over the chaos.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. We're not ready for this.\" But then another part of me kicks in, the part that's been trained for this. I'm torn between panic and this eerie calm.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, like coiled springs. My mouth is dry. I can feel my pulse pounding in my ears. It's like every sense is heightened.",
    "Therapist: Keep going, John. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I see movement in a building across the street. Before I can even think, I'm raising my rifle. I fire. Once, twice. I see a figure fall. Did I... did I just kill someone? The thought barely has time to register before more gunfire erupts.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a solid 9 now. I can feel sweat on my palms, just like that day.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: *exhales shakily* Right, I'm here. I'm safe. But it feels so real, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The firefight feels like it lasts forever, but it's probably only minutes. Reinforcements arrive. The shooting starts to die down. But Miller... he's not moving. I'm covered in his blood. I can't tell if he's breathing. I'm screaming for a medic again.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm devastated. Angry. Scared. It's all mixed up. I feel like I failed him. Like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, John. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The medics finally reach us. They're working on Miller, but I can see it in their eyes. It's bad. I'm being pulled away, someone's checking me for injuries, but I can't take my eyes off Miller. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. This can't be real.\"",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe, John. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Yeah, I'm here. I'm safe. But God, it's like I can still smell the blood and gunpowder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The next few hours are a blur. We're back at base. There's debriefing, but I can barely focus. I keep seeing Miller's face, hearing the gunshots. I'm exhausted, but I know I won't be able to sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in that moment?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like I'm watching everything from outside my body. But underneath, there's this rage building. At the enemy, at myself, at the whole damn war. And guilt. So much guilt.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, John. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. The intensity is starting to fade a bit, but it's still there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm in my bunk now. It's quiet, but my mind won't shut up. I keep replaying every moment, wondering if I could have done something differently. If I had been faster, smarter, better... would Miller still be alive? I can still feel his blood on my hands, even though I've scrubbed them raw.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"I'm not cut out for this. I can't do this.\" But then I feel guilty for even thinking that. Like I'm letting my team down, letting Miller down. I should be stronger than this.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but wired at the same time. My muscles ache. My head is pounding. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I don't sleep that night. Or the next. Every time I close my eyes, I'm back in that Humvee. I start volunteering for extra patrols, extra duties. Anything to keep busy, to keep from thinking. But it doesn't help. The memories are always there, just under the surface.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also like releasing some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good, John. You're making progress. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels relieved, like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. But it's also scary, you know? Like, what do I do now?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, okay. It's just... it's been so long, carrying this around. Part of me is afraid to let it go, you know? Like, if I do, I'm forgetting Miller or something.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6 now. I'm starting to feel a bit more grounded.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... there's also this weird sense of accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's still hard, still painful, but... I don't know. Maybe there's hope?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. We'll end here for today. Well done."
