    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's... it's intense. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? It's hard to put into words. Going through that memory again, it's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the fear, the helplessness... but this time, I also felt like I could observe it from a distance. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: (pauses) I think... the smell. I hadn't remembered that before, but today it was so vivid. The musty odor of his cologne mixed with... (voice breaks) with sweat. It made me feel nauseous all over again. But I also noticed how young and scared I felt. I've always blamed myself, you know? But today, I could see that little girl, and I just wanted to protect her.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to view yourself that way?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels sad for that little girl, but there's also anger. Why didn't anyone protect me? And then there's this guilt because I'm a successful professional now, and sometimes I feel like I should be \"over it.\" But clearly, I'm not. (sighs) I'm also thinking about how this has affected my relationships, especially with my husband. I've always struggled with intimacy, and now I can see why.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. How might this insight impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be more patient with myself? And perhaps talk to my husband about this. He knows about the abuse, but I've never really opened up about how it affects me day-to-day. It's scary to be vulnerable, but I'm starting to see how keeping it all inside isn't helping.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave step. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: (long pause) I... I remembered something new. There was a moment when someone walked by the room. I heard footsteps, and for a second, I thought I might be saved. But they just kept walking. I felt so... abandoned. And you know, that feeling, it's followed me my whole life. In my career, in my relationships... I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for people to let me down or leave.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that pattern feel?",
    "Client: It's... enlightening, I guess? And a little overwhelming. It's like I'm seeing my life through a new lens. But it also gives me hope. If I can understand these patterns, maybe I can change them. I don't want to live in fear anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: (thinks) Maybe... I could try to open up to my husband about one specific way the trauma affects me. Just as a start. And perhaps work on not always expecting the worst in situations at work. It's exhausting always being on guard.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... tired, but also more... I don't know, grounded? Like I understand myself a bit better. It's still painful, but I feel like I have a direction now. And I'm proud of myself for getting through the exposure. I didn't think I could do it, but I did.",

    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
