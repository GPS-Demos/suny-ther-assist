    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about the home invasion, and it's making me feel on edge all the time.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it going to be intense?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's crucial for healing. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to know what I'm getting into. The idea of revisiting that night... it makes my heart race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll revisit the memory safely. It helps process the trauma. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I think so. Go ahead. I'm listening, but I'm feeling a bit anxious already.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You'll describe the event in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Describe it? Out loud? That seems... terrifying. I've been trying so hard not to think about it. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. But avoiding memories often intensifies PTSD. This helps you process them.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? Or can't continue? I'm worried I might break down or something.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We can pause anytime. You're in control here. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's reassuring to know I can stop if needed. But I'm still scared. Will you be there the whole time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll support you throughout. Your bravery is commendable, Amir.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I guess I'm just worried about reliving it all again. It's been hard enough dealing with the memories and the anxiety that comes with them. And now, intentionally going back there... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process, while challenging, aims to reduce your symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really want to get better. It's affecting my relationship, my work... everything. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at your pace. Shall we discuss what to expect during the session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing what's coming might help me feel a bit more prepared. At least, I hope it will.",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll recount the event, focusing on sensory details. I'll guide you with questions.",
    "Client: Sensory details? Like what I saw and heard? That's... vivid. I can already feel my heart racing thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It may be intense, but remember, you're safe here. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but also... hopeful? If this can help me move past this trauma, I want to try. It's been controlling my life for too long.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Amir. Remember, we're a team in this. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm okay for now. Just... thank you for being here with me through this. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. Your strength is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this."
