    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about what happened. The idea of deliberately focusing on it feels... wrong, somehow. Like I'm inviting trouble. And honestly, I'm scared of how I might react.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. Many feel this way initially.",
    "Client: Really? That's... somewhat reassuring, I suppose. But I still don't quite understand how this is supposed to help. Won't reliving it just make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It may feel counterintuitive, but exposure helps process trauma memories.",
    "Client: Process them? What does that mean exactly? And how can you be sure it won't just... I don't know, retraumatize me or something?",
    "Therapist: Great question. Processing means integrating memories safely. We'll go slowly and carefully.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I get it. But what if I panic? Or if it becomes too much? I'm worried I might lose control.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I appreciate that. It's just... this is all so new and scary. I've never talked about this with anyone before, not even my wife. The thought of diving into it now is... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. This step is significant in healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I guess I'm just trying to psych myself up for this. Can you tell me a bit more about what to expect? Like, what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it aloud while I guide you.",
    "Client: Describe it aloud? That sounds... intense. Will I need to close my eyes? And how long will this take?",
    "Therapist: Eyes closed can help, but it's optional. We'll go for about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That's a long time to be in that headspace. But I suppose that's the point, right? To stay with it instead of avoiding it?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It allows your brain to process and adapt over time.",
    "Client: I see. And you mentioned you'll be guiding me. What does that mean? What will you be doing while I'm... reliving this?",
    "Therapist: I'll ask questions to keep you engaged and provide support throughout.",
    "Client: Okay. That's reassuring. I think... I think I'm ready to try this. It's scary, but if you believe it can help, I want to give it a shot. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Your reactions are normal and valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm grateful for your support through this. I guess... let's do this, then. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's begin. I'm nervous, but I trust you. I'm ready to face this and hopefully start moving forward."
