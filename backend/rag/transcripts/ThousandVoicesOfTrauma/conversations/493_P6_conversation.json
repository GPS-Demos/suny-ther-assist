    "Therapist: Hello, Mrs. Johnson. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the home invasion...",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm in my living room, reading a book. It's late evening, and John is upstairs. Suddenly, I hear a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart starts racing immediately. I... I freeze, unsure of what to do.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 4. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue...",
    "Client: I slowly get up, my legs shaking. As I approach the kitchen, I hear shuffling and whispered voices. I'm terrified. I peek around the corner and see two men in dark clothing. One of them notices me and shouts. I scream and run towards the stairs, calling for John.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's jumped to a 7. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to tremble.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going...",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I hear heavy footsteps behind me as I run up the stairs. John appears at the top, looking confused. I yell at him to call the police. One of the men grabs my ankle, and I fall. I'm kicking and screaming, terrified they'll hurt us.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: (nods) John pulls me up, and we lock ourselves in the bedroom. We can hear them ransacking the house. I'm shaking uncontrollably, and John is trying to calm me while calling 911. The wait feels endless. Every sound makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still high, about an 8. I feel so helpless and scared, even now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) Finally, we hear sirens. The intruders must have heard them too because we hear them running out. When the police arrive, I'm still trembling. I can't stop crying. I feel violated, like our home isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit, maybe a 6. I feel drained, but also relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's take a moment to breathe...",
    "Client: (takes deep breaths) Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 4. I'm feeling calmer, but tired.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown incredible courage today."
