    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the home invasion, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 right now. Just thinking about it is making me tense up.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe that night.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm in bed, reading a book. The house is quiet, and I can hear the clock ticking in the hallway. Suddenly, there's a loud crash downstairs. My heart... it just stops for a second.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I freeze. I can't move. I'm straining to hear any other sounds. There's shuffling, like someone moving around downstairs. Oh God, I remember feeling so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... (exhales shakily) I finally manage to move. I reach for my phone on the nightstand, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely hold it. I'm trying to dial 911, but I keep messing up the numbers. I can hear footsteps on the stairs now, and I'm panicking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally get through to 911. I'm whispering, terrified they'll hear me. The operator is asking me questions, but I can barely focus. The footsteps are getting closer, and I'm looking around frantically for something to defend myself with.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe an 8 or 9.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... I grab the lamp from my bedside table. My hands are sweating, and I'm worried I'll drop it. I can hear them trying doorknobs in the hallway. Each click makes me flinch. I'm pressed against the headboard, lamp raised, just waiting...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doorknob to my room starts to turn. I'm holding my breath, my whole body is tense. The door creaks open, and I see a shadow. I... I scream and throw the lamp. There's a crash, a shout, and then... and then...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) Sirens. I hear sirens outside. The intruder, he... he runs. I can hear him thundering down the stairs. I'm sobbing, still clutching my phone. The police arrive, but I can't stop shaking. I feel so violated, so... so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking a bit. My heart's racing. But... I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor. Notice five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I see the plant in the corner, the painting on the wall, your desk, the clock, and the bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, tell me three things you can hear.",
    "Client: I hear... the air conditioning, a car passing outside, and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's continue. What happened after the police arrived?",
    "Client: They... they searched the house. I couldn't stop crying. One of the officers, a woman, she sat with me and tried to calm me down. They found where the intruder had broken in through a window downstairs. There was glass everywhere...",
    "Therapist: How did you feel seeing the broken window?",
    "Client: Angry. Scared. Like my safe space had been violated. I kept thinking about how easily they had gotten in, how vulnerable I was.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What happened next?",
    "Client: The police took my statement. I was still shaking, could barely get the words out. They advised me to stay with someone else that night, but I... I couldn't bear to leave. This was my home. I didn't want to be driven out.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a difficult decision. How did you manage that night?",
    "Client: I didn't sleep. I sat in the living room with all the lights on, jumping at every sound. I felt so alone, so... exposed. I kept replaying the events in my head, wondering what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have those thoughts. How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still there, but not as intense. Maybe a 5?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue. What happened in the days following the invasion?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't sleep properly for weeks. Every noise woke me up. I installed a security system, got new locks, but it didn't help much. I felt like I was constantly on edge, waiting for it to happen again.",
    "Therapist: How did this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it changed everything. I struggled to concentrate at work. I was irritable with my family. I started avoiding going out, especially at night. I felt like I was always looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. I just tried to push through, but I was exhausted all the time. I started having nightmares about the invasion, sometimes waking up screaming. My daughter suggested I see a therapist, but I was resistant at first.",
    "Therapist: What made you decide to seek help eventually?",
    "Client: I... I realized I couldn't go on like that. I was pushing away the people I loved, living in constant fear. One day, I had a panic attack at work when someone dropped a stack of books. That's when I knew I needed help.",
    "Therapist: That was a brave decision. How are you feeling now, talking about all this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. But I feel like I can breathe a little easier. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 4. It's still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: I... I feel proud, actually. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but... I feel stronger.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible resilience. Let's end with some grounding exercises.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Breathes slowly)",
    "Therapist: Now, name one thing you can taste, two things you can smell, and three things you can touch.",
    "Client: I can taste... mint from my tea earlier. I can smell... your lavender air freshener and the rain outside. I can touch... the armrest of this chair, my necklace, and the fabric of my shirt.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Calmer. More... present. My SUDS is probably down to a 2 now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. You've done incredibly well today, Sarah. Remember to practice your coping strategies this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... this was hard, but I feel like I've taken a big step forward.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."
