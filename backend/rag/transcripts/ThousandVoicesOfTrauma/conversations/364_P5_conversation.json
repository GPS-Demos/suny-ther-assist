    "Therapist: Hello, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that home invasion. I've spent so much time trying to forget it, you know? I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I completely lose it? Or what if I can't handle it and have to stop? I don't want to disappoint you or waste your time.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would be helpful. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still scared. It's been years since I've allowed myself to really think about what happened that night. Even now, just talking about it, I can feel my heart racing a bit. It's like... I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with the purpose of this exercise.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. I just... I guess I need to know why we're doing this. How is reliving that nightmare going to help me? I've been trying so hard to push it away, to focus on my family and my work. But it's always there, just beneath the surface. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy, jumping at every little noise in the house.",
    "Therapist: The exposure helps process the memory and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: Process the memory? I... I guess that makes sense. It's like, right now, it's this big, scary thing that I can't control. But maybe if I face it head-on, it'll become... I don't know, more manageable? It's just hard to imagine ever feeling okay about what happened.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. What do you expect might happen during the exercise?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm afraid I might have a full-blown panic attack. Or maybe I'll freeze up and not be able to speak at all. Part of me is worried that talking about it will make it worse, like I'll start having more nightmares or flashbacks. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's... that's reassuring. I appreciate that you're not pushing me too hard. It means a lot that you understand how difficult this is for me. I've never really talked about this with anyone, not even my wife. She knows it happened, but I've always downplayed it. I didn't want her to worry or see me as... weak, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Your strength in facing this is admirable. Any questions before we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. Um, yeah, I do have a question. What if... what if I start to feel overwhelmed? Like, if I feel like I can't breathe or something? And also, how long does this usually take? I'm just trying to mentally prepare myself for what's ahead.",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. It typically lasts about 30-45 minutes. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. I think... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is harder than anything I've ever done, even compared to my time in the military. At least then I knew what I was facing. This feels like I'm walking into the unknown.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, yes. Let's do this. I'm scared, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? If this can help me sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat, or help me stop feeling like I need to check the locks a dozen times... it'll be worth it. I'm ready. Where do we start?"
