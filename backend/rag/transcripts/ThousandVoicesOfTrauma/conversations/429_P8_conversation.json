    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it all felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's this heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. I keep seeing flashes of that day - the explosion, the chaos. But there's also this... I don't know, almost a sense of relief? Like I've been holding my breath for years and I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's strange. For so long, I've tried to push these memories away, you know? But now, talking about it, it's like I'm finally acknowledging what happened. It's terrifying, but also... freeing? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: My hands are still trembling a bit. I notice I'm clenching my jaw. But my breathing... it's starting to slow down. I feel a little lightheaded, but not in a bad way. It's like... like I'm coming out of a fog.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my team... the ones we lost that day. There's guilt, definitely. But also... gratitude? I survived when others didn't, and I've carried that weight for so long. But now, I'm starting to think maybe... maybe it's okay that I survived. Maybe I can honor their memory by living my life fully.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to say that out loud?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel tears welling up, but they're not just sad tears. It's like... relief, grief, hope, all mixed together. I've never really allowed myself to feel this before. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe healing?",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my life, my relationships. I've kept people at arm's length, even my family. I was so afraid of being vulnerable, of being hurt again. But now... I'm starting to see that maybe opening up isn't weakness. Maybe it's strength.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your childhood experiences?",
    "Client: Oh, wow... I hadn't even thought of that. But yeah, I can see the connection. Growing up, I learned to be tough, to never show weakness. The military reinforced that. But those childhood experiences... they made me build walls long before I ever saw combat.",
    "Therapist: Mm. And how do you feel about those walls now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to see that they've protected me, but they've also isolated me. It's like I've been living in a fortress, safe but alone. And now, it's like I'm peeking over the walls and realizing there's a whole world out there. It's terrifying, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm ready to start taking down those walls, brick by brick. It won't be easy, and I'm sure there will be setbacks. But for the first time in a long time, I feel... hopeful? Like maybe I can heal, maybe I can have real connections again.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I'm exhausted, but it's a good kind of tired. Like after a long hike, you know? And I'm... I'm proud of myself. I never thought I could face these memories, but I did it. I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. It's hard, but I can see now that it's worth it. I want to learn how to open up more, maybe even talk to my family about some of this. And I... I think I want to find a way to honor my fallen comrades. Not just by feeling guilty, but by living a life they'd be proud of.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... intense. But good. Really good. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I feel like I've taken a big step today.",
    "Therapist: You have. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you. See you next time."
