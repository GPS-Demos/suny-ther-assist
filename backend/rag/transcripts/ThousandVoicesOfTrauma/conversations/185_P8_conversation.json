    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. It's like a whirlwind of emotions right now. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory... it felt so real, you know? Like I was right back there, experiencing it all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, wait... it's more like a mix of fear and anger. I'm angry that this happened to me, that I still feel so affected by it. But there's also this undercurrent of fear, like I'm waiting for something bad to happen again.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that fear?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm always on edge. Even though I know I'm safe here, part of me is still that scared kid, you know? I keep thinking about how helpless I felt back then, and sometimes I worry that I'll feel that way again. It's exhausting, constantly being on guard.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense. I just noticed I'm clenching my fists too. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body's preparing for something bad, even though my mind knows I'm okay right now.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did I have to go through this? And then I feel guilty for thinking that because I know other people have been through worse. But then I get angry at myself for minimizing my own experiences. It's like this constant back-and-forth in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the trauma first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're less intense now, I guess. Back then, it was all-consuming. I couldn't think about anything else. Now, it's more like... background noise? It's still there, but I can function despite it. Sometimes, though, like during this exercise, it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded when these memories surface?",
    "Client: Um, deep breaths help a bit. And sometimes I try to focus on something in the room, like counting objects or describing what I see. It helps pull me back to the present. Oh, and talking about it, like we're doing now. It makes it feel less overwhelming when I can put it into words.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience fitting into your overall recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me feels like I should be \"over it\" by now, you know? But another part recognizes that I've made progress. I mean, I can talk about it now without completely falling apart. That's something, right? I guess it's just... it's a process. Sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?",
    "Client: Hmm... I guess I've realized I'm more resilient than I thought. The fact that I can face these memories, even though it's hard, that takes strength, doesn't it? And I'm more aware of my emotions now. I used to just try to shut everything out, but now I'm learning to sit with the uncomfortable feelings.",
    "Therapist: How has this affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Sometimes I push people away because I'm afraid of getting hurt again. But I'm also learning to open up more, especially with my partner. They've been really supportive. It's scary to be vulnerable, but it's also kind of freeing, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you hope to gain from continuing this work?",
    "Client: I want to feel... normal, I guess. Or maybe not normal, but at peace? I want to be able to think about what happened without feeling like it's happening all over again. And I want to stop letting it control my life. I want to be able to trust people and form deeper connections without this constant fear holding me back.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mixed bag. Some days I feel really proud of how far I've come. Other days it feels like I haven't made any progress at all. But overall, I think I'm moving in the right direction. It's slow, and it's not always easy, but I'm starting to see glimpses of who I could be without all this weighing me down.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on self-compassion. I'm really hard on myself sometimes, especially when I'm struggling. Maybe if I could be a little kinder to myself, it would make this whole process easier. Is that... is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's end here for today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, I think. Like I've done some important work. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I'm looking forward to our next session."
