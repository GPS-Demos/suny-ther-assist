    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. To be honest, I'm... I'm a bit on edge. My hands are a bit shaky. I know we've talked about this, but actually doing it... it's different.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes and bringing yourself back to that day. Describe what you see, hear, and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon. I remember because I had just finished lunch with my grandson. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I can feel goosebumps on my arms. There's a faint smell of cleaning solution... The teller calls \"Next,\" and I step forward. That's when I hear it... a loud crash and shouting.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: Three men burst in. They're wearing masks and carrying guns. My heart... it's pounding so hard. One of them fires a shot into the ceiling, and there's plaster falling. People are screaming, dropping to the floor. I... I can't move. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My hands are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The man with the gun, he's shouting at us to get down. His voice is muffled behind the mask, but I can hear the panic in it. I slowly lower myself to the ground. The cold tile... I can feel it through my clothes. There's a young woman next to me, she's crying softly. I want to comfort her, but I'm too scared to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my family. Will I see them again? My ex-wife... even though we're divorced, I wish I could talk to her one last time. And my grandson... oh God, I was supposed to pick him up from school later. Who will tell him if something happens to me?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. I'm... I'm shaking. I feel so helpless, like a child again. It reminds me of... of when my father would...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Take another deep breath. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: The robbers are yelling at the tellers. One of them is waving his gun around wildly. I can hear drawers opening, money being stuffed into bags. Someone's cell phone rings, and one of the robbers loses it. He starts screaming, demanding to know whose phone it is. No one moves. He fires another shot into the air. The sound is deafening.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? Give me a number.",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, telling the story.",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I did survive. I... I keep telling myself that. The robbers are getting more agitated. They're arguing among themselves. One wants to leave, another says they need more time. I can hear sirens in the distance. They're getting louder.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The sirens are really close now. The robbers are panicking. They're shouting at each other. One of them grabs me... pulls me to my feet. He's using me as a shield. His arm is around my neck, the gun pressed against my temple. I can smell his sweat, feel his breath on my ear. He's trembling too.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I think this is it. This is how I die. I close my eyes and think of my grandson's face. I'm so sorry I won't see him grow up. The robber is dragging me towards the door. My legs feel weak, like they might give out at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. We're at the door now. The police are outside, I can see their lights flashing through the glass. The robber is shouting demands. He wants a car, he wants safe passage. His grip on me tightens. I'm struggling to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a moment of chaos. Someone trips the fire alarm. The sprinklers go off. In that split second of confusion, I feel the robber's grip loosen. Without thinking, I elbow him hard and duck. There's a shot... so loud. I feel a burning pain in my shoulder. I'm on the ground, water raining down on me. Everything's a blur of movement and noise.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. My shoulder hurts, even now. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe proud? I fought back. I didn't just freeze.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What happens after you're on the ground?",
    "Client: It's chaos. Police rush in. There's shouting, more gunshots. I'm lying there, my shoulder bleeding. A police officer kneels beside me, puts pressure on my wound. He's talking to me, but I can barely hear him over the ringing in my ears. I'm cold, so cold from the sprinklers. I keep thinking about my grandson, about how I need to stay alive for him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. Talking about fighting back... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're loading me onto a stretcher. The pain in my shoulder is intense, but I'm alive. As they wheel me out, I see the robbers being handcuffed. One of them, the one who held me, he looks so young. Just a kid, really. For a moment, our eyes meet, and I feel... I don't know, pity maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's a complex emotion. Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: It's strange. This person threatened my life, but seeing him there, he looked so scared and lost. It reminded me of... of myself as a child, after my father would... you know. That fear, that helplessness. I wondered what had happened to him to lead him here.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Conflicted. Angry still, but also... sad. It's all so wasteful, you know? Lives ruined over what? Some money? It makes me think about cycles of trauma, how they perpetuate.",
    "Therapist: These are profound reflections. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's often a sign of progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I see the clock on the wall, your degrees hanging next to it, the plant in the corner, the box of tissues on the table, and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, how would you rate your distress?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. Still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about what we've accomplished today?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess. And grateful. I didn't think I could talk about this without falling apart. But here I am, doing it. It's still hard, but... I feel stronger.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good for now. This was a lot, but... I'm glad we did it. Thank you, Doctor.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mr. Chen. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll discuss this experience further in our next session."
