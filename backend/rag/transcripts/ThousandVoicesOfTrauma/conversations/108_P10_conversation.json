    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. We're diving into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure I'm ready. But I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin when you're ready. Describe the scene.",
    "Client: Right... Okay. I'm... I'm at the bank. It's a regular Tuesday afternoon. I'm there to deposit some checks from my business. The line is moving slowly, and I'm getting a bit impatient. I just want to get this done and head home to my family.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There's... there's about ten people in line. The tellers look bored. I can smell that sterile bank smell, you know? Like paper and cleaning products. I'm fidgeting with my phone, checking emails...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. At first, I think someone dropped something, but then I hear shouting. \"Everyone on the ground! Now!\" My heart starts racing. I... I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... There are three men. They're wearing masks and carrying guns. One of them is waving his gun around, screaming at everyone. I drop to the floor, my face pressed against the cold tile. I can hear people crying, whimpering. The smell of fear is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: I... I can't stop shaking. One of the robbers grabs a woman nearby. She's sobbing. He's yelling at her to shut up. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. Will I ever see them again? I should have kissed my wife goodbye this morning. I should have told my kids I love them. God, what if I die here?",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe now. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. A 9, maybe? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The robbers are arguing with the bank manager now. They want access to the vault. I can hear sirens in the distance. Part of me feels relieved, but I'm also terrified. What if this turns into a shootout?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my ears. I'm sweating, but I feel cold. I can't stop trembling. I... I think I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police are outside now. I can hear them on a megaphone, telling the robbers to surrender. One of the robbers is getting agitated. He's pacing, waving his gun around. I'm... I'm scared he might start shooting.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to run. I want to get up and make a break for the door. But I'm too scared to move. I feel like a coward. I should be doing something, anything...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still... still high. Maybe an 8.5 now? I'm feeling a bit light-headed.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Okay... The negotiation goes on for what feels like hours. My legs are cramping from being on the floor. I'm so thirsty. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they know what's happening. Do they think I'm dead?",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: The robbers are getting more nervous. They're arguing among themselves. One wants to give up, but the others are refusing. I can hear people praying softly around me. The air feels thick, heavy with fear and sweat.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My muscles ache from being tense for so long. My mouth is dry. I feel like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to feel more drained than panicked.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a lot of commotion. The police are coming in. There's shouting, chaos. I hear gunshots and I... I think I wet myself. I'm so ashamed, but I'm too scared to care. People are screaming, running. Someone trips over me as they're trying to escape.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. These are normal reactions. What happens next?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. The police are everywhere. They're telling us it's over, that we're safe. But I can't move. I'm... I'm just lying there, shaking. Someone helps me up, but my legs are so weak I can barely stand.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like this isn't real. I'm outside now, and there are ambulances, police cars. Someone puts a blanket around me, but I can't stop shaking. I see my wife running towards me, crying. I want to comfort her, but I can't speak. I just... I just break down in her arms.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's take a few deep breaths together. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 5 now? I feel drained, but also... relieved? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh... your desk, the window, the bookshelf, the clock, and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. It's strange, but talking about it... it helps. It's like the memory loses some of its power.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You did very well today. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 3? I feel more in control now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few more minutes to decompress before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this, but I'm glad I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working through this in our next sessions."
