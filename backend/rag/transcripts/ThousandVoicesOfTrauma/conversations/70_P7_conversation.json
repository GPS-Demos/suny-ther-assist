    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the memory of your severe illness?",
    "Client: Okay... I was 12 years old, lying in a hospital bed. The room was so white, so sterile. I remember the constant beeping of machines around me. My parents were there, but they looked so worried, so helpless. I felt weak, like I could barely move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The doctors kept coming in and out. They spoke in hushed tones, and I could tell something was wrong. I was scared, really scared. My body felt hot, but I was shivering. The pain... it was everywhere. I remember thinking, \"Am I going to die?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't breathe. It feels like I'm back there, struggling for air. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I remember my mother holding my hand. She was trying to be strong, but I could see tears in her eyes. That scared me even more. I felt so alone, even with people around me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: The nights were the worst. The hospital was quieter, but that made the beeping of the machines seem louder. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw images of needles, tests, and worried faces. I felt so helpless, so out of control.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is racing, just like it did back then. I can almost smell the antiseptic, feel the scratchy hospital gown on my skin. But... I know I'm here. It's different now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're staying present while recalling the memory.",
    "Client: There was a moment when I overheard the doctor telling my parents that my condition was critical. I pretended to be asleep, but I heard everything. The fear in that moment was overwhelming. I felt like my whole world was collapsing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what happened next.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur of tests and treatments. I was poked and prodded so much that I lost count. Each time a doctor or nurse came in, I braced myself for more pain. I started to associate the sound of footsteps in the hallway with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I remember crying at night when I thought no one could hear me. I felt so weak for crying, but I couldn't stop. The fear of dying, of leaving my family... it was too much to bear.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but... I feel like I'm finally facing it. There's a part of me that's still that scared little boy in the hospital bed, but I know I'm not there anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it, really reliving it... it's tough, but I can see now that I survived. I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's end here and discuss how you're feeling."
