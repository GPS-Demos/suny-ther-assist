    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is kind of dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this experience. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: Um, okay... I'm in my dorm room. It's early morning, and I hear this loud rumbling. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then everything starts shaking. Books are falling off my shelves, and my desk lamp crashes to the floor.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably a 4 or 5.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shaking is getting worse. I can hear people screaming in the hallway. I'm frozen for a second, but then I realize I need to get out. I grab my phone and keys and stumble towards the door. The floor is moving so much it's hard to walk.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I make it to the hallway, and it's chaos. People are running, some are crying. The emergency lights are flashing, and there's dust in the air. I can smell something burning.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My hands are shaky, and I'm breathing fast.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I join the crowd heading for the stairs. It's hard to keep my balance because the building is still shaking. Someone falls in front of me, and I help them up. We're all pushing to get down the stairs.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's higher... maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We finally make it outside. The ground is still moving, and I can see cracks forming in the pavement. Trees are swaying wildly, and car alarms are going off everywhere. I look back at the dorm, and... oh god...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Sarah. What do you see?",
    "Client: Part of the building has collapsed. There's a huge cloud of dust, and I can hear people screaming for help. I... I feel so helpless. I want to go back and help, but I'm terrified the rest of the building will come down.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe now. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm standing there, just watching. It feels like forever, but it's probably only been a few minutes. The shaking starts to slow down, but there are still aftershocks. I see some of my friends and we huddle together. We're all crying and shaking.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Is this really happening?\" and \"What if there's another one?\" I'm worried about my family, but my phone isn't working. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts in such a situation. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe an 8 or 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The next few hours are a blur. Emergency services start arriving. There are sirens everywhere. They're pulling people out of the building. Some are okay, but others... I see them carrying out bodies. I can't look away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you watch this?",
    "Client: I feel numb. Like it's not real. But at the same time, I'm terrified and sad. I keep thinking about the people I know who live in that part of the building.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're all herded to a safe area on campus. There's no power, no cell service. We're just sitting there, waiting for news. Every aftershock sends people into a panic. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the building collapsing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Remember to stay grounded. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: Right, okay. Um, as night falls, it gets worse. It's dark, and we can hear distant sirens and sometimes screams. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they know I'm okay. I feel so alone, even though I'm surrounded by people.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very difficult. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I tried to help. I started talking to people around me, sharing what little food and water I had. It helped to focus on others. But every time the ground shook, even a little, I'd freeze up.",
    "Therapist: That was very brave of you. What happened the next morning?",
    "Client: The sun came up, and we could see the full extent of the damage. Buildings were crumbled, roads were cracked. It looked like a war zone. They started evacuating us. I remember getting on a bus, looking back at the campus... it was devastating.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, recalling all this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest feels tight, and I'm getting teary. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived this, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breaths* It's still vivid, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today, Sarah. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... I think this helped. It's like I can look at it more clearly now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
