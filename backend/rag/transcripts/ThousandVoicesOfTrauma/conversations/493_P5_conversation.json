    "Therapist: Mrs. Thompson, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Oh dear, I'm not quite sure what to expect. I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting the home invasion memory in detail. This helps process the trauma.",
    "Client: Revisit it? That sounds frightening. I've spent so much time trying to forget that terrible night. Why would we want to bring it all back up again?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. Facing the memory can reduce its power over you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Well, when you put it that way, it makes some sense. But I'm worried about getting overwhelmed. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I suppose I should trust the process, even if it's difficult. My depression has been so bad lately, and I'm willing to try anything that might help. Do you really think this could make a difference?",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful for PTSD symptoms and associated depression. Your willingness is courageous.",
    "Client: Thank you, dear. I do want to feel better. It's been hard on my family, especially my husband. He's been so patient. I just want to be able to enjoy our golden years together without this constant fear and sadness hanging over us.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is admirable. Shall we begin? Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I'm ready. But what exactly should I do? Do I just start talking about that night?",
    "Therapist: Yes, describe the event in detail, as if it's happening now. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try my best. It's strange, even though it happened months ago, I can still remember every little detail so vividly. The sound of the glass breaking, the heavy footsteps... Oh, I'm already feeling anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you, dear. I'm glad you're here with me. I don't think I could face this alone. Is it alright if we take breaks if it gets too intense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You can pause anytime. Your comfort is important.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I'll do my best to push through, but knowing I can stop if needed helps. Should I close my eyes while I'm talking about it?",
    "Therapist: Whatever feels most comfortable for you. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. Here goes... It was a quiet Tuesday evening, around 9 PM. My husband and I were watching our favorite show..."
