    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more trouble sleeping lately, and the anxiety seems to be getting worse.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I remember you mentioning it briefly last time, but I'm not sure what it entails. To be honest, it sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving that night of the home invasion. It was terrifying, and I'm not sure I can handle going through it again. What if I panic? Or what if it makes my anxiety even worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared it might be too overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It can help process the trauma. We'll go at your pace. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I guess so. I trust you, but I'm still apprehensive. Can you explain how this is supposed to work?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it in present tense. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. Will I be able to stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I appreciate that. So, what exactly will I be doing during this exercise?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event, focusing on sensory details. I'll ask questions to help you along.",
    "Client: Sensory details? Like what I saw, heard, and felt? That's... a lot to think about. I've been trying so hard to avoid those memories.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Avoidance often increases symptoms. This helps you process them safely.",
    "Client: I see. It makes sense, but it's scary. How long will we do this for?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We'll start small and build up. How are you feeling about it now?",
    "Client: A bit better, knowing I can stop if needed. But I'm still nervous. What if I get overwhelmed or have a panic attack?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We have coping strategies ready. Remember your breathing exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, I do. Those have been helpful. It's comforting to know we have a plan if things get too intense. I suppose I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. Yes, let's do this. I want to get better, even if it's difficult. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the night of the invasion."
