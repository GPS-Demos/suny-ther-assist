    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the home invasion... it brought back so many vivid details I thought I'd forgotten. The sound of the glass breaking, the footsteps... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was paralyzing. I remembered hiding in my closet, praying they wouldn't find me. I could hear them ransacking my apartment, and I kept thinking about what would happen if they opened that door. It... it reminded me of when I was younger, you know? That same helpless feeling.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving it feel different from your usual memories?",
    "Client: It was more... intense. Usually, I try to push those thoughts away, but this time I had to face them head-on. It was scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived it once, and I survived telling it again.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How might this relate to your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it shows I'm stronger than I think? It's hard to see that sometimes, especially when I'm anxious. But going through this and coming out the other side... it makes me think maybe I can handle more than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I noticed that even though the memory was terrifying, I was able to stay present here in the room with you. That's new for me. Usually, when I think about it, I feel like I'm right back there. But this time, I could separate the past from the present a little better.",
    "Therapist: How might that skill help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I suppose it could help me deal with triggers better? Like, if something reminds me of the invasion, maybe I can remind myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It's hard, but... I think it could make a difference.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What was challenging?",
    "Client: The hardest part was... was when the memory overlapped with my past abuse. There was a moment when I heard the intruder near my hiding spot, and suddenly I was a kid again, terrified of what was coming. It... it made me realize how much these experiences are connected in my mind.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that connection now?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. But also kind of clarifying? I've always treated these as separate traumas, but maybe they're more intertwined than I thought. It explains why certain things trigger both memories at once.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How can we use this?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on addressing both at the same time? I don't know if that's possible, but it seems like healing from one might help with the other. It's scary to think about, but if it could help...",
    "Therapist: It's a possibility worth exploring. Anything else?",
    "Client: I noticed that talking about it now is a bit easier than it was at the beginning of our sessions. Don't get me wrong, it's still hard, but... I don't feel as overwhelmed. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's often part of the process. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved, I guess? And hopeful. It makes me think that maybe, with time, this won't have such a hold on me. I mean, I know it'll always be part of my history, but maybe it doesn't have to control my future, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to see that facing these memories, as hard as it is, is actually helping. It's like... the more I confront them, the less power they have over me. I'm still scared, and I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but... I think I'm ready. It's not easy, but if it can help me move past this and live my life without constant fear and anxiety, then it's worth it. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?"
