    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The memories of my time in the cult, they're just so overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel apprehensive. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know logically that I'm safe, but emotionally... it's hard. Especially after losing my brother last year. He was the one who helped me leave the cult.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Are you ready to begin the exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to a significant moment in the cult.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's my first day. The compound is bustling with activity. People are smiling, but their eyes seem... empty. The leader, he's approaching me with open arms. His charisma is palpable, but there's something unsettling about his gaze.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: He's welcoming me, telling me I've finally found my true family. But I feel... I feel trapped. Like I've made a terrible mistake. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I want to run, but I can't. My brother is there too, and he looks so happy. I can't leave him behind. The leader is touching my shoulder, and I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're leading us to the main hall. There's chanting, it's getting louder. The incense is so strong, it's making me dizzy. I see people I know from my old life, but they're different now. They're... they're not themselves anymore.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I can't breathe. My brother, he's looking at me with concern. But he doesn't understand. He doesn't see what I see.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here, in the present.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm here. I'm sorry, it just felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: There's no need to apologize. You did well.",
    "Client: It's just... thinking about my brother there, and now he's gone. It's like I've lost him twice.",
    "Therapist: That's a painful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like I've let out something that's been bottled up.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. Especially after losing my brother. It's like reopening old wounds.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for your patience with me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care."
