    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, in the middle of that terrible flood. The roar of the water, the... the smell of the damp and mud. It's all so vivid. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... it's more like... terror. Even though I know I'm safe here, there's this part of me that still feels in danger. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that terror in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my chest. Like a tight knot that's making it hard to breathe. And my hands are shaking. I can't seem to stop them. It's... it's embarrassing, really. A man my age, trembling like a leaf.",
    "Therapist: It's a natural response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if it happens again? What if... what if next time I'm not so lucky? I lost everything in that flood - my home, my possessions, nearly my life. And Margaret... oh, Margaret. She never really recovered from the shock. I can't help but wonder if that's what led to her passing so soon after.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. How are you coping with those thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to remind myself that I survived. That I'm here, that I'm safe. But it's hard. Sometimes I feel so... so helpless. Like I'm just waiting for the next disaster to strike. And now, living in this assisted living place... it's like I've lost my independence too. It's... it's a lot to bear.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe just to know that it's okay to feel this way? That I'm not... weak for still being affected by this after all these years?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry too. Angry at the world, I suppose. For taking so much from me. My home, my wife, my... my sense of security. It's not fair. I worked hard all my life, and now... now I'm left with nothing but these terrible memories.",
    "Therapist: How does expressing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've been holding onto it for so long, trying to be strong, you know? But it feels good to let it out. To acknowledge it. I... I didn't realize how much it was weighing on me.",
    "Therapist: What's different about sharing it now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I suppose I feel less alone with it. Talking about it here, with you... it makes it feel more manageable somehow. Like maybe I don't have to carry this burden all by myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm noticing that my breathing has slowed down a bit. The knot in my chest... it's still there, but it's not quite as tight. And my hands... they're steadier now. It's... it's strange how talking about it can make such a difference.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to previous times you've recalled the memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Usually, when I think about the flood, I try to push it away as quickly as possible. But this time... facing it head-on, it's... it's hard, but I feel like I'm... I don't know, maybe processing it better? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What's giving you that sense?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's because I'm allowing myself to really feel it, instead of running from it. And talking about it... it's like I'm finally acknowledging how much it affected me. How much I lost. It's painful, but... but also somehow freeing.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's... it's a strange mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: What do you need to take care of yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some quiet time. Maybe a cup of tea and some time to just... be. To let all of this settle. And maybe... maybe to remember some of the good times with Margaret. To balance out the painful memories, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. Is there anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For listening, for... for helping me face this. It's not easy, but I think... I think it might be necessary. For the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe... maybe there's hope. That I won't always be haunted by this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself before I leave. And maybe... maybe to remind myself that I survived. That I'm still here, still fighting. That feels important somehow.",
    "Therapist: Let's do that together. Ready when you are.",
    "Client: [Takes a deep breath] I am here. I survived. I am still fighting. [Exhales slowly] Thank you, doctor. I... I think I'm ready to face the rest of my day now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Mr. Johnson. Take care."
