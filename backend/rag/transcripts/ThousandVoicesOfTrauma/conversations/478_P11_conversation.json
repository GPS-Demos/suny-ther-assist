    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that night. The memories are so vivid, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs, and my heart starts racing all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was paralyzing. I remember hiding in my closet, trying not to breathe too loudly. I kept thinking about my late wife, wishing she was there with me. It's silly, I know, but I felt so alone and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: It's not silly at all. How did it feel to share that today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. But also, I don't know, maybe a little liberating? I've never really talked about it in such detail before. I always tried to push it away, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What's going through your mind now?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this incident has affected me. I've been so anxious ever since, always checking the locks, installing more security systems. It's exhausting, but I can't seem to stop.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've become quite isolated. I rarely go out, especially at night. I've turned down invitations from friends, even missed my grandson's evening school play. It's like I'm still hiding in that closet, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... it's sad, really. And frustrating. I don't want to live like this, always afraid. But I don't know how to change it.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a big step. What might help you feel safer?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe talking about it more? And perhaps gradually trying to do more things outside my home? It's scary to think about, but I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's very brave. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Could we... could we work on some strategies for managing my anxiety when I'm out? And maybe set some small goals for me to try between sessions?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll definitely do that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also a bit hopeful. It's like a weight has been lifted, sharing all this. I didn't realize how much I was carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else would you like to discuss today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk more about my relationship with my family. I've been pushing them away, and I want to change that. Can we work on that too?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's explore that next time. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds good. Thank you, doctor. I... I appreciate your help. It's not easy, but I think I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mr. Lee. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
