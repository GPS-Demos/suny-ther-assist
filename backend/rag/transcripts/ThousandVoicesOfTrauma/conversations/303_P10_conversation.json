    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my body knows what's coming and it's trying to protect me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm in our old living room. The yellow wallpaper is peeling in the corner. I can smell Mom's cigarettes. It's late afternoon, the light's all golden and dusty.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: Dad just got home. I can hear his keys jingling. Mom's in the kitchen, I think. There's this... tension in the air. Like everyone's holding their breath.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My stomach's in knots. I want to hide, but I'm frozen on the couch.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad storms into the kitchen. His face is red, and I can smell the alcohol from here. He's yelling something about dinner not being ready. Mom's voice is quiet, trying to calm him down.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I see... I see Dad grab Mom's arm. She yelps. There's a crash \u2013 I think he knocked over a chair. My heart's racing. I want to help her, but I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here in the present. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay. Mom's crying now. Dad's voice gets louder. He's calling her names, terrible names. I can see them through the doorway. He raises his hand and... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Sarah. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (sobbing) He hits her. Hard. She falls against the counter. There's blood. Oh God, there's blood on her face. I'm shaking. I want to scream but nothing comes out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can barely breathe. My hands are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. This is just a memory. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (deep, shaky breaths) Okay. Okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Mom's on the floor now. Dad's still yelling, kicking at her. I finally find my voice and scream. He turns and sees me. His eyes... they're not human. They're like a wild animal's.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He comes towards me. I run to my room, slam the door. I can hear Mom crying, begging him to stop. I'm under my bed, hands over my ears, but I can still hear everything.",
    "Therapist: How old are you in this memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm seven. Just a little girl. (crying) Why didn't I help her? Why was I such a coward?",
    "Therapist: You were a child, Sarah. It wasn't your responsibility to intervene.",
    "Client: But I should have done something! Anything!",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could have done?",
    "Client: I wish... I wish I could have been brave enough to call the police. Or run to the neighbors. Or... or somehow protect Mom.",
    "Therapist: Those are big expectations for a seven-year-old. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Take some deep breaths with me.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah. I... I stay under the bed for what feels like hours. Eventually, it gets quiet. I hear Dad's truck start up and drive away. I'm still too scared to move.",
    "Therapist: What happens then?",
    "Client: After a while, Mom comes to my room. Her face is swollen, there's dried blood on her lip. But she smiles at me, tells me everything's okay. That it won't happen again. But I know it will. It always does.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. At Dad, at Mom for lying, at myself for being helpless. And scared. Always scared.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal reactions, Sarah. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Can you tell me more about what happened after that?",
    "Client: We... we just went on like nothing happened. Mom made dinner. I did my homework. But everything felt different. Like the world had shifted. I couldn't sleep that night. Or many nights after.",
    "Therapist: How did this experience affect you in the long term?",
    "Client: I became hyper-vigilant. Always watching, always waiting for the next explosion. I struggled to trust anyone. Loud noises still make me jump. And I... I have a hard time believing that relationships can be safe.",
    "Therapist: Those are common responses to trauma. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've set it down for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a good observation. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. Let's take a few more deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay. I feel a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Good. As we wrap up this session, is there anything else you want to share about this memory?",
    "Client: I just... I wish I could go back and hug that little girl. Tell her it's not her fault. That she'll survive this and become strong.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. How does it feel to think about comforting your younger self?",
    "Client: It feels... healing, I guess. Like maybe I can start to forgive myself a little.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight, Sarah. You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you've done. You should be proud of yourself. Let's end here for today and discuss how you're feeling about this experience next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I think this is helping, even though it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue working through this together."
