    "Therapist: Alright, John, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the earthquake...",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. It's early morning, and I'm getting ready for work. Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. It's subtle at first, but then it gets stronger. I can hear things falling off shelves, and the windows are rattling. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay, continue...",
    "Client: The shaking is getting worse. I'm trying to get to a doorway, but I'm stumbling. I can hear my neighbors screaming. There's a loud crack, and I see a huge crack forming in the wall. I'm terrified the building might collapse. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going...",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The power goes out, and it's pitch black. I can hear things crashing all around me. I'm frozen in place, unable to move. The shaking seems to go on forever. I'm thinking about my wife, wondering if she's safe. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. You're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Right, right. Okay... As the shaking subsides, I hear sirens in the distance. There's dust everywhere, and I can smell gas. I'm coughing, trying to find my phone to call my wife. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you survived this. Keep going...",
    "Client: I finally get through to my wife. She's okay, but stuck in traffic. The roads are chaos. I tell her to stay put. I look out the window and see collapsed buildings, people running in the streets. It's like a war zone. I feel so small, so insignificant in the face of nature's power...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now. I'm feeling more sad than scared at this point.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Continue...",
    "Client: The aftershocks keep coming. Each one sends a jolt of fear through me. I decide to leave the building, afraid it might collapse. Outside, it's chaos. People are crying, injured. I want to help, but I don't know how. I feel guilty for being okay when others aren't...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7. I'm feeling overwhelmed thinking about all the destruction.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well processing these difficult memories.",
    "Client: (sighing) Yeah... The rest of the day is a blur of aftershocks, news reports, and trying to contact family and friends. The uncertainty was the worst part. Not knowing if another big quake was coming, if buildings were safe, if everyone was accounted for...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's back down to a 5. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced the memory and survived it again.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, John. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together and then we can discuss what you experienced."
