    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Miguel?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, Dr. Martinez. It's a lot to process. Going through that hostage situation again in my mind, it's like I was right back there in the hospital. My heart's still racing a bit, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, definitely. I could feel it in my chest, just like that day. But also... I noticed something new this time. I remembered how one of the nurses tried to keep us calm. She was so brave, whispering words of comfort even though she was scared too. I hadn't thought about her in a while.",
    "Therapist: Interesting observation. How did recalling that affect you?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, it reminds me that there was some humanity in that terrifying situation. But it also makes me feel guilty. Like, why couldn't I be as brave as her? I was just frozen, useless.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does that guilt relate to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I often feel like I'm not doing enough. In school, in my relationship. It's like I'm still that scared kid in the hospital, unable to act. Sometimes I wonder if my girlfriend deserves someone stronger, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How might challenging that belief impact your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, when you put it that way... Maybe if I could see myself differently, not as a victim but as a survivor, it could help. It's just hard to shake off that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: I could... maybe try to focus on the times I've been strong since then? Like how I've managed to continue my studies despite everything. Or how I've opened up to you and my girlfriend about this trauma.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight, Miguel. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful, I guess. Like maybe I'm not as weak as I thought. But it's also scary. What if I try to be stronger and fail?",
    "Therapist: Valid concern. How might you handle that fear?",
    "Client: I suppose I could remind myself that even trying is a form of strength. And maybe talk to my girlfriend about it. She's always telling me I'm stronger than I think.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What else helped you get through today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly? Knowing you were here, listening. And remembering why I'm doing this - to reclaim my life, my future. It's tough, but I want to get better.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your commitment. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Yeah... I'm exhausted, but also kind of proud. Each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Miguel. How will you take care of yourself tonight?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my mom, maybe watch a movie with my girlfriend. Something light, you know? And I'll try to remember what we talked about - that I'm stronger than I realize.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Thanks, Dr. Martinez. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, Miguel."
