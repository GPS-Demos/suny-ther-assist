    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work, it was late evening. I saw flashing lights and heard shouting. As I got closer, I saw several police officers surrounding a young Black man. He had his hands up, but they were yelling at him. I... I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The man looked terrified. He was trembling, saying \"Please don't shoot\" over and over. One officer approached him aggressively, gun drawn. I wanted to intervene, but I was paralyzed with fear. My heart was racing, and I felt sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the officer tackled the man to the ground. There was a scuffle, and then... (voice breaking) I heard a gunshot. The man cried out in pain. I... I can still hear his scream. It was horrifying. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Blood started pooling around him. The other officers just stood there, not helping. I wanted to run, to help, to do something, but I couldn't move. I felt so helpless, so angry. How could they do this? He wasn't a threat!",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: People started gathering, shouting at the police. Someone was filming with their phone. I finally found my voice and yelled for someone to call an ambulance. The tension in the air was palpable. I was shaking uncontrollably, tears streaming down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: The ambulance arrived, but it felt like it took forever. They took the man away, but I didn't know if he would survive. The crowd was getting angrier, and the police started pushing people back. I stumbled home in a daze, feeling numb and shocked.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you feel when you got home?",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the man's face, heard the gunshot. I felt guilty for not doing more, angry at the police, and scared that it could happen to me or someone I love. It's like the world suddenly became a much darker, more dangerous place.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I had nightmares. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, reliving that moment. I started avoiding that street, always looking over my shoulder. I became hyper-aware of police presence, my heart racing whenever I saw a patrol car. It's like I lost my sense of security in my own neighborhood.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: The incident affected my relationships too. I became irritable, withdrawn. My partner didn't understand why I was so on edge all the time. I couldn't explain the constant fear and anger I felt. It was straining our relationship, but I didn't know how to process what I'd seen.",

I felt torn between wanting to make a difference and needing to protect my mental health.",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength in sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's still hard. Talking about it brings back those intense emotions. But I'm also feeling... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like sharing this burden makes it a bit lighter. I want to heal, to not let this define me, but it's a struggle every day.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I hope that by working through this, I can find a way to cope and maybe even use my experience to help others. It's a long road, but I'm willing to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll end here for today."
