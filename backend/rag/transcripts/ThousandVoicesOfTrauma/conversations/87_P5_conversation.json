    "Therapist: Mr. Thompson, today we'll be doing imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this technique?",
    "Client: Not really, no. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but I'll guide you through it. How are you feeling about trying?",
    "Client: Well, to be honest, I'm a bit nervous. At my age, I've been through a lot, but reliving that home invasion... it's not something I look forward to. I've tried so hard to forget it all these years.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... I've spent so long trying to push those memories away. The thought of bringing them back up, especially now that I'm alone... it's frightening. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes things worse? I've already been struggling with my drinking because of this, and I don't want to spiral further.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? It's been affecting me for so long, even when I try to ignore it. Perhaps facing it head-on might finally give me some peace. But I'm still scared, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a insightful perspective. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like reliving the entire thing all over again? Because I'm not sure I can handle that. It was terrifying enough the first time around.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You'll describe the event, and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds a bit less daunting. But what if I get overwhelmed? What if I panic or can't continue? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my nerves aren't what they were.",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. Your safety is my priority. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate that, truly. I guess knowing we can stop if it gets too much helps. It's just... it's been so long since I've talked about this with anyone. After my wife passed, I felt even more vulnerable. This whole process is bringing up a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. How do you feel about starting next session?",
    "Client: I... I think I can do that. It won't be easy, but if you think it will help, I'm willing to try. I've carried this burden for too long. Maybe it's time I faced it, even at my age. Can you just... can you promise you'll be there to help me through it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We're in this together. Any other questions or concerns?",
    "Client: Just one more thing. After we do this, after I talk about it all... what happens then? Will I feel better right away, or is it a process? I'm just trying to understand what to expect in the long run.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but many find relief. We'll work through it step by step.",
    "Client: I see. Well, I suppose that's all I can ask for. Thank you for explaining all this to me. It's still scary, but I feel a bit more prepared now. I just hope I can get through it without falling apart or reaching for a drink afterward.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident. Shall we end here and prepare for next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I need some time to mentally prepare myself. Thank you for your patience with me today. I know I asked a lot of questions, but this is all so new and frightening. I'm glad you're here to guide me through it."
