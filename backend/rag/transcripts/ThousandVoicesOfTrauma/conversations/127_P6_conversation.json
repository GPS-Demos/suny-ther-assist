    "Therapist: Alright, James. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember to tell me your SUDS rating when I ask. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the bullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the school cafeteria. It's loud, and I can smell the food. I'm sitting alone, trying to eat my lunch quietly.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 3 out of 10. I'm a bit tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: I see a group of guys approaching. They're laughing and pointing at me. One of them, the leader, he's got this mean smirk on his face. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They surround my table. The leader, he starts making these awful slant-eye gestures and speaking in a mocking accent. I... I feel so small and humiliated. My cheeks are burning, and I can't look up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're getting louder now. One of them knocks my tray off the table. Food spills everywhere. Everyone in the cafeteria is staring. I want to disappear. I... I can feel tears welling up, but I'm trying so hard not to cry.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel sick to my stomach. My SUDS is probably at an 8 now. It's... it's really intense.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... The bullies are still there, laughing. A teacher finally notices and comes over. But even as they're being told off, they're still smirking at me. I feel so angry and helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My fists are clenched, and I'm shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The teacher makes them leave, but everyone's still staring. I'm trying to clean up the mess, but my hands are shaking so much. A girl offers to help, but I'm too embarrassed to accept. I just want to run away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 6? I still feel awful, but the worst part is over.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I gather my things and leave the cafeteria. I can hear whispers and a few giggles as I walk out. I head to the bathroom and lock myself in a stall. That's... that's where I finally break down and cry.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7. Remembering how I felt in that moment... it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're very brave for facing this memory.",
    "Client: Thanks... I remember sitting there for what felt like hours, trying to calm down. I was so scared to face everyone again. I felt so alone and different from everyone else.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as we near the end of this exercise?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit better. Maybe a 5 now? It still hurts, but I feel like I can breathe easier.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... I'm back in the present now. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Well done, James. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Drained, but... kind of relieved too? Like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. We'll discuss this further next time."
