    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I joined this group on campus that seemed friendly at first. They invited me to meetings and study sessions. It felt nice to belong somewhere. But then things started to change. They began controlling what I ate, who I talked to, even how I dressed. It was subtle at first, but it got more intense over time.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: They... they told me my family didn't understand me, that only the group truly cared. I started distancing myself from everyone else. I felt so confused and alone, but they said that was normal, that I was \"evolving.\" I spent all my free time with them, neglecting my studies. I was sleep-deprived from late-night meetings and early morning rituals. I... I'm sorry, this is hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. Um, there was this leader who seemed to know everything. He'd single me out sometimes, praising me in front of others. It made me feel special, but also scared. He started suggesting that I had a \"higher purpose\" and that I should consider leaving school to devote myself to the group full-time. I was terrified but also tempted. They had become my whole world.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: One night, during a particularly intense session, they had us all confess our deepest secrets. I shared something very personal, and afterward, I felt so exposed and vulnerable. The leader used that information to manipulate me, threatening to reveal it if I ever thought of leaving. I felt trapped, like I couldn't breathe. I wanted to run, but I was too scared. I didn't know who I was anymore.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. I remember feeling so lost, like I was drowning. They had stripped away everything that made me... me. My independence, my dreams, my relationships. I was just a shell, following their commands. The worst part was, a small part of me still believed they cared, that this was all for my own good. How could I have been so blind?",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have mixed feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: I started having panic attacks. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. My grades were slipping, and I was lying to my family about everything. One day, my roommate from before - we hadn't talked in months - she confronted me. She said I looked like a ghost of myself. It was like a slap in the face. I broke down and told her everything. She helped me reach out to a counselor, and slowly, I started to see how manipulated I'd been. But getting out... it was the hardest thing I've ever done. They harassed me, threatened me. I was terrified they'd follow through on their threats to expose my secrets. I felt so ashamed and stupid.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter? It's still painful to remember, but talking about it... it's like I'm reclaiming my story. I'm angry at them, but also at myself for falling for it. I'm scared that I'll never fully trust myself or others again. But I'm also proud that I got out, that I'm here trying to work through this. It's a mix of everything, really.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know I have a long way to go, but being able to talk about this without completely falling apart... it feels like progress. I want to understand why I was so vulnerable to their manipulation, so I can protect myself in the future. And maybe, someday, I can help others who've been through similar experiences. Is that... is that a realistic goal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your insight is commendable.",
    "Client: Thanks. I guess I'm learning to trust my own judgment again, slowly but surely. It's scary, but also empowering. I'm rediscovering who I am without their influence, and while it's challenging, it's also exciting. I'm reconnecting with old friends, focusing on my studies again, and even considering joining some campus clubs - real ones this time. But I'm taking it slow, being cautious. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That's more than okay. It's wise.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I still have nightmares about being back there, or I'll see someone who looks like a member of the group and panic. But I'm learning to ground myself, to remind myself that I'm safe now. It's a process, isn't it? Learning to feel secure again, to trust my own thoughts and feelings. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but sometimes it's frustrating how long it's taking.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: You're right. I need to remember that. Every day I stay true to myself is a victory. I'm learning to celebrate the small wins. Like today, being able to talk about this without dissociating or having a panic attack - that's huge for me. I'm starting to see a future for myself that isn't defined by this experience. It's still a part of my story, but it doesn't have to be the whole story. I want to reclaim my life, my dreams. It's scary, but also exciting. I feel like I'm finally starting to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I am proud, actually. It feels good to acknowledge that. I know there will still be tough days ahead, but I feel more equipped to handle them now. I'm building a support network, learning coping strategies, and most importantly, learning to trust myself again. It's a journey, but I'm committed to it. I want to turn this painful experience into something meaningful, something that makes me stronger. Is that too idealistic?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a healthy outlook.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I guess I'm learning to balance being cautious with being hopeful. It's okay to dream again, to have ambitions. The cult tried to strip that away from me, but they didn't succeed. I'm here, I'm healing, and I'm moving forward. It's not always easy, but sessions like this remind me of how far I've come. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Our time is almost up. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something heavy I've been carrying. I'm a bit emotionally raw, but also stronger. Talking about it like this, really diving into the memories and feelings, it's intense but also liberating. I feel like I've taken another step in my healing journey. Thank you for creating a safe space for me to do this work.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
