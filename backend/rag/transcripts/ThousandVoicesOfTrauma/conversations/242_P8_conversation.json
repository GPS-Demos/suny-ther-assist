    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you take me through the memory we discussed?",
    "Client: Okay... It's hard to talk about, but I'll try. I was scrolling through my social media feed when I saw this post. Someone had taken a picture of me from a party and edited it to make me look... ridiculous. They added cruel captions and it had already been shared hundreds of times. I felt my stomach drop and my hands started shaking. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now as you recall this?",
    "Client: I feel... ashamed. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat a little. It's like I'm right back in that moment, seeing all those comments and likes. People I thought were my friends were laughing at me. I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\"",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I guess... it reminds me of how alone I felt after losing my grandmother. She was always my biggest supporter, and without her, I felt so vulnerable. This cyberbullying incident just reinforced that feeling of vulnerability and isolation. It's like the world is out to get me sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clenched now. I'm angry, but also scared. What if it happens again? What if I can never trust anyone? I keep replaying all the mean comments in my head. It's like a loop I can't escape from. I feel so exposed and powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw is clenched. I'm also feeling a bit nauseous. It's like my body is trying to curl up and protect itself. I can feel my heart racing too. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not safe anywhere.\" Even in my own room, with my phone or computer, I don't feel safe. I worry about what people are saying about me when I'm not around. I think, \"Maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe I deserve this.\" It's exhausting carrying these thoughts all the time.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... paralyzing. I've started avoiding social situations. I barely post anything online anymore. I'm always second-guessing myself, wondering if something I say or do will be used against me. It's affecting my studies too. I can't concentrate because I'm always on edge, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice changing as we talk about this?",
    "Client: Actually, I feel... a little lighter? Like, it's still painful to talk about, but sharing it with you makes it feel less overwhelming. My breathing is a bit easier now. I'm realizing that even though it was a horrible experience, I survived it. I'm still here, still fighting.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, I guess. A small part of me feels proud for getting through it. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts, but maybe I'm stronger than I thought. It's like, for the first time, I can see a tiny light at the end of this dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to do with that strength?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to use it to start reclaiming my life. Maybe I could join a support group for cyberbullying victims. Or start advocating for stricter online harassment policies. It won't erase what happened, but it might help me feel less helpless. And maybe, just maybe, I could help prevent this from happening to someone else.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that future feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Scary, but hopeful. Like I'm taking back some control. My chest feels a bit looser, and I'm sitting up straighter. I'm not naive enough to think it'll be easy, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a way forward.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing now?",
    "Client: Determination, I think. It's mixed with fear and sadness, but determination is definitely there. I want to heal. I want to trust again. I want to stop letting this experience define me. It's going to be a long journey, but I think I'm ready to take the first step.",
    "Therapist: How can we support that determination in our future sessions?",
    "Client: Maybe we could work on strategies for dealing with anxiety in social situations? And perhaps some techniques for challenging those negative thoughts when they come up? I'd also like to explore ways to build my self-esteem back up. It took such a hit, and I want to learn how to value myself again, regardless of what others might say or do.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like after a hard workout. It was tough to go through all of that, but I feel like I've made some progress. There's still a lot to work on, but I'm not feeling as hopeless as I was at the beginning of our session. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
