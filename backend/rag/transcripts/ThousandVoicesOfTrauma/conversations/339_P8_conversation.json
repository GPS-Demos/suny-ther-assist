    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of that airplane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screams, smell the burning fuel. My heart is pounding, and my palms are sweaty. I feel like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold, gripping sensation in my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, watching that plane go down. I couldn't do anything to stop it. And now, I can't shake this feeling that something terrible could happen at any moment. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How does this fear compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's different, but similar. Back then, it was pure shock and disbelief. Now, it's more like... a constant state of anxiety. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next disaster. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel safe again. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: That sounds draining. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why did I have to see that?\" and \"What if it happens again?\" It's like my brain is stuck in a loop, replaying the worst moments over and over. And then there's this guilt... I survived, I wasn't even on the plane, but so many others didn't make it. I feel... I don't know, almost ashamed that I'm struggling so much when I wasn't directly involved.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How do you cope with them in your daily life?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not well. I've been drinking more than I should, trying to numb these feelings. It helps in the moment, but then I wake up feeling worse. I've been avoiding airports, obviously, but also any news about air travel. I've even stopped watching movies or TV shows that might have plane scenes. It's like I'm living in this bubble, trying to pretend that planes don't exist. But they do, and I know I can't avoid them forever.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What do you think might help you feel safer?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me thinks that if I could understand more about air safety, it might help. But then another part of me is terrified to even think about it. Maybe... maybe talking about it more, like we're doing now? It's hard, but it also feels like a release. I've been holding this in for so long, afraid to burden others with my fears.",
    "Therapist: That's a good insight. How does it feel to share these thoughts and feelings?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of emotions. There's relief, definitely. Like a weight is being lifted. But there's also fear, like I'm opening Pandora's box. What if talking about it makes it worse? What if I can't handle the memories? But then... there's also a tiny spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, by facing this head-on, I can start to move past it. It's scary, but also... necessary, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave perspective. What's one small step you could take towards feeling safer?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could start by reading some factual information about air safety. Nothing too graphic, just statistics and safety measures. Or... maybe I could try some relaxation techniques when I start feeling anxious. I've heard deep breathing can help. It's not much, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a great start. How do you feel about trying that this week?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but... I think I'm ready to try. It can't be worse than living in constant fear, right? And knowing that I have these sessions to process what comes up... it helps. I feel less alone in this. It's still scary, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of light at the end of this very long tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What else is coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this fear has controlled my life. I've missed out on so much \u2013 family vacations, work opportunities, even just the joy of looking up at the sky without panicking. There's a part of me that's angry... angry at the circumstances, angry at myself for letting it affect me so much. But there's also a growing determination. I want my life back. I want to be able to watch my niece's soccer games without flinching every time I hear a plane overhead. It's going to be hard, but... I think I'm ready to put in the work.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can we support that determination?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could set some goals? Small ones at first, like the reading about air safety we mentioned. And then maybe work our way up to bigger challenges, like watching a movie with a plane scene, or even visiting an airport observation deck. It sounds terrifying right now, but having a plan, a roadmap of sorts, might make it feel more manageable. And knowing I have these sessions to process my reactions... it makes me feel safer about trying.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Shall we start planning those steps for next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. It's scary, but also... exciting? Is that weird to say? For the first time in a long time, I feel like I might actually be able to overcome this. There's still a lot of fear and doubt, but also a spark of hope. Thank you for... for helping me see that there might be a way through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like I've run a marathon or something. Emotionally exhausted, but also lighter. There's still fear and anxiety, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did at the start of our session. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... cautiously optimistic? It's a strange mix of emotions, but overall, I think I feel... okay. Better than I have in a while, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember to be kind to yourself this week.",
    "Client: I'll try. It's not always easy, but I'm starting to see the importance of self-compassion through all of this. Thank you for your guidance today. I know we have a long road ahead, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like it's a road I can actually travel. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
