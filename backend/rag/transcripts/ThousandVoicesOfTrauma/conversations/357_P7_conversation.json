    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the event?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at home, and my wife and I are arguing about finances. It started small, but it's escalating quickly. I can feel my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: She's yelling now, saying I don't contribute enough. I'm trying to explain, but she's not listening. I feel cornered, helpless. My palms are sweating, and I'm starting to feel that familiar tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't want to remember this part. She's throwing things now, a vase shatters near my feet. I'm frozen, can't move. The sound is so loud, it reminds me of when I was bullied in school. I feel like that helpless kid again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can smell the perfume from the broken vase. It's mixing with the tension in the air. My wife is screaming at me to leave, but I can't move. I'm shaking. I want to defend myself, but no words come out. I feel so ashamed, so weak.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I tell her to stop, that this isn't right. But my voice is trembling. She laughs at me, calls me pathetic. I feel a surge of anger, but also fear. I'm afraid of what might happen if I lose control.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The neighbors are knocking now. I hear them asking if everything's okay. My wife suddenly changes, puts on a calm face. She opens the door, says we're just having a disagreement. I stand there, unable to speak up. I feel so trapped, so alone even with people right there.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: After the neighbors leave, there's this horrible silence. My wife acts like nothing happened. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to leave, but where would I go? I'm a successful professional, but in this moment, I feel like a complete failure. I can't even protect myself in my own home.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I retreat to the bedroom, lock the door. I can hear her in the kitchen, cleaning up the mess like it's just another day. I'm sitting on the bed, my whole body shaking. I'm thinking about my parents, how disappointed they'd be. In our culture, men are supposed to be strong, in control. But I feel anything but that.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I spend the night in the guest room. The next morning, she acts like nothing happened. I go to work, put on my professional face. But inside, I'm crumbling. I feel like I'm living a lie. Everyone sees me as this successful, put-together man. But at home, I'm... I'm this weak, scared person. I don't know how to reconcile these two versions of myself.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Reliving this is hard, but there's also a small sense of relief. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of pushing it down. But I'm also scared. What if I can't change this situation? What if I'm stuck like this forever?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard to talk about this. But I want to get better. I don't want to live in fear anymore. I want to find my strength again, to stand up for myself. But it feels like such a long road ahead.",
    "Therapist: You've taken an important step. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know I'm not alone in this. I've kept it hidden for so long, it's both terrifying and liberating to finally speak about it. I hope... I hope I can find a way to feel safe and respected in my own home again.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling exhausted, but also a bit lighter. Like I've started to lift a weight I've been carrying for years. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to face this and work on making changes. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
