    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Chen. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My hands are a bit shaky. But I'm here, ready to face this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day on the airplane. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm settling into my seat. Window seat, 14A. The cabin smells like a mix of cleaning products and that distinct airplane smell. My carry-on is tucked under the seat in front of me. I can feel the cool air from the vent above.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The flight attendants are going through their safety demonstration. I'm only half-listening... I've heard it so many times before. But now... now I wish I'd paid more attention. Oh god...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart... it's starting to race. I can feel it pounding in my chest. There's this knot forming in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's climbing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We're... we're taking off. The engines are roaring. I can feel the pressure pushing me back into my seat. We're climbing higher and higher. I'm looking out the window, watching the ground get smaller...",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your surroundings?",
    "Client: The seatbelt sign is still on. People around me are settling in, some are reading, others are putting on headphones. It all seems so... normal. But then... then there's this... this awful jolt.",
    "Therapist: What happens with that jolt?",
    "Client: The plane... it drops suddenly. My stomach lurches. I can hear gasps and cries from other passengers. The oxygen masks drop down. Oh god, oh god...",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. You're doing well. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80, maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm grabbing for the oxygen mask. My hands are shaking so much, I can barely get it on. The plane is shuddering violently. I can hear the engines making this awful, sputtering noise.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. This is it. I never got to say goodbye to my sister. I never... I never told her how much I love her. Oh god, why didn't I call her more often?",
    "Therapist: Stay present with those thoughts. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The... the captain's voice comes over the intercom. He's trying to sound calm, but I can hear the tension in his voice. He's saying we're experiencing severe turbulence, that we're trying to find a clear air pocket. But I don't believe him. This feels like more than turbulence.",
    "Therapist: How is your body reacting?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking uncontrollably. My knuckles are white from gripping the armrests. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up at any moment. And I can't stop crying. Silent tears are just... streaming down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: The plane... it feels like it's falling. Just... plummeting. I can see the ocean getting closer through the window. People are screaming, praying. I close my eyes. I can't look anymore. I'm thinking of my parents, my sister, my whole life flashing before me...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: *inhales sharply* Right... right. I'm here. But in that moment... I was certain it was the end.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the painting on the wall, and... and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: Okay... The plane... it's still shaking violently. But somehow, miraculously, it starts to level out. The captain's voice comes back on. He's saying we've regained control, that we're diverting to the nearest airport. I can hardly believe it. I'm... I'm still alive.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trembling. My whole body feels weak, like I've run a marathon. My chest hurts from how hard my heart is pounding. I feel... I feel dizzy, lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens as the plane starts to land?",
    "Client: We're... we're descending. It's not smooth. The plane is still shuddering. I can see the runway approaching. I'm gripping the armrests so tight my fingers are cramping. The wheels touch down and... and there's this collective gasp of relief from everyone.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as the plane comes to a stop?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Tears are just pouring down my face. I'm sobbing, but it's like... it's like I can't make a sound. My throat feels tight. I'm gasping for air. People around me are hugging each other, crying, praying. But I'm just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still up there. Maybe 85? I can feel my heart racing even now, just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. What happens as you leave the plane?",
    "Client: We're... we're told to leave everything and evacuate. My legs feel like jelly. I can barely stand. Someone... a flight attendant, I think... helps me to the emergency exit. As I step onto the inflatable slide, I just... I break down completely. I'm crying and shaking as I slide down.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice once you're on the ground?",
    "Client: There are... there are emergency vehicles everywhere. Flashing lights, sirens. The tarmac is hot under my feet. I can smell jet fuel. People are being guided to a building nearby. I'm... I'm in shock. I can't believe I'm alive. I keep touching my face, my arms, making sure I'm real.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you recall these moments?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... grateful? Is that strange? To feel grateful after something so terrifying?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common reaction. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe around 70 now? I feel... I feel like I've lived through it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you... I... I never thought I could talk about this in so much detail.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. How are you feeling now that we've gone through this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. We'll end our session here, but I want you to be gentle with yourself for the rest of the day. You've done important work today.",
    "Client: Thank you... I... I think I need a long nap after this.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly understandable. We'll discuss this further in our next session. Take care, Mrs. Chen."
