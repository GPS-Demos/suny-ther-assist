    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us to the day of the accident.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... It's a sunny afternoon. I'm driving home from class. The radio's on, playing some pop song. I'm... I'm feeling good, you know? Like things are finally looking up.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... trees lining the road. It's that winding part of Route 9. The sun's kinda in my eyes, so I pull down the visor. And then... oh God...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Sarah. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's... there's a car coming around the bend. It's... it's in my lane. Why is it in my lane? I... I try to swerve, but it's too late. The sound... the awful crunching sound...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I can hear the glass shattering.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) The airbag goes off. It hits me so hard. I can't... I can't breathe. Everything's spinning.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. I think I'm screaming, but I can't hear myself. There's this ringing in my ears. And the pain... oh God, the pain in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I smell gasoline. And something burning. I'm trying to move, but I'm pinned. My leg... I can't feel my leg. Why can't I feel my leg?",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. This is it. I'm never going to see my parents again. I never got to... to tell them I love them. (Starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. Let it out. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Through tears) It's a 9. Maybe... maybe higher. I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) I... I hear sirens. They sound far away. I'm trying to stay conscious, but it's hard. Everything hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I see someone at my window. A firefighter, I think. He's saying something, but I can't make it out. They're going to get me out. But I'm so scared. What if moving me makes it worse?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm outside of it. Watching from somewhere else. But also, every nerve is on fire. I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that sensation. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're cutting the car open. The sound is horrible. Like... like the car is screaming. Or maybe that's me. I'm not sure anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Remember that. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. An 8, maybe? I... I remember them pulling me out. The sunlight is so bright. It hurts my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: They put me on a stretcher. Everything's a blur of faces and voices. Someone's holding my hand. Telling me I'll be okay. But I don't believe them. How can I be okay after this?",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve this? And... and guilty. Maybe if I'd been paying more attention...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're loading me into the ambulance. The siren is so loud. I... I keep fading in and out. I hear them saying something about internal bleeding. I think... I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that fear. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: All the things I never got to do. All the people I'll never see again. I... I feel so alone. So scared. I don't want to die like this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8? I... I remember arriving at the hospital. The bright lights. So many people talking at once.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The cold. I'm so cold. And the smell... antiseptic, I think. Someone's cutting off my clothes. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're putting needles in me. Taking blood. Asking me questions I can't answer. My head hurts so much. I... I think I'm going to throw up.",

    "Client: Like it's not mine anymore. Like I'm trapped in this broken shell. I... I hear them say something about surgery. And then... then everything goes black.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now? I... I remember waking up later. The pain is... it's different. Duller, but still there.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see when you wake up?",
    "Client: White walls. Machines beeping. My parents... oh God, my parents are there. They look so worried. I've never seen my dad cry before.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing them make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved. Guilty. Scared. I... I don't know how to tell them I'm sorry. Sorry for putting them through this.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's explaining things, but I can barely focus. Something about a punctured lung, broken ribs, my leg... I'll need physical therapy.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel hearing this?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Angry. Why me? How am I supposed to go back to school like this? Everything's ruined.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 6? I... I remember the next few days in the hospital. The pain, the tests, the nightmares.",
    "Therapist: Tell me about the nightmares.",
    "Client: They're... they're always about the crash. But worse. Sometimes I'm trapped in the car as it burns. Sometimes I see the other driver's face, laughing at me.",
    "Therapist: How do these nightmares make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Terrified. I... I wake up screaming sometimes. The nurses have to come calm me down.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a deep breath. What happens when you leave the hospital?",
    "Client: Going home is... it's strange. Everything looks the same, but I feel so different. My parents are hovering, always watching me. I feel like a burden.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry at myself. I... I should be grateful I'm alive, but sometimes... sometimes I wonder if it would've been easier if I hadn't survived.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal, Sarah. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start wrapping up. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But... but also a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Take a deep breath. You can open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) That was... intense. But I made it through.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You showed incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need some water.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a break and then we'll debrief."
