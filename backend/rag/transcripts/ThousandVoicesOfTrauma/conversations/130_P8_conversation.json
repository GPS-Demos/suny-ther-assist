    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is buzzing. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the images, you know? They're so vivid, even now.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. I keep thinking about how young and naive I was back then. How easily I fell for their promises of belonging and purpose. But then I remember the fear, the constant anxiety of never knowing if I was doing enough, if I was truly \"worthy.\" It's like I'm right back there, feeling trapped and powerless all over again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, like I'm bracing for something. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's... it's almost like I can smell the incense they always burned during our \"cleansing\" rituals. God, I haven't thought about that in years.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger, definitely. A lot of anger. At them for manipulating me, but also at myself for falling for it. There's shame too, deep shame. And... and a sort of grief, I guess? For the years I lost, the relationships that were damaged. It's overwhelming, like I'm drowning in all these feelings at once.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I think... I think they're all tied up with this sense of betrayal. Not just by the cult leaders, but by my own judgment. I trusted them, I believed in what they were selling. And now, even decades later, I struggle to trust myself sometimes. It's like that experience left this... this permanent mark on how I see the world and my place in it.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What do you notice about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, aren't I? That's something. I'm facing this head-on instead of trying to bury it like I did for so long. It's hard, really hard. But there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? That I'm strong enough to confront this now. And I'm noticing that while the memories are still intense, they don't completely overwhelm me like they used to. I can step back a bit, see them for what they are - just memories, not my current reality.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of liberating. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful and scary to revisit all of this. But there's also this glimmer of hope, you know? Like maybe I'm not as trapped by my past as I thought. It's a strange mix of vulnerability and strength. I feel raw, exposed, but also... I don't know, maybe a little bit empowered?",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that feeling of empowerment?",
    "Client: It's subtle, but it's there. It's like... for so long, I felt like a victim of what happened to me. And in many ways, I was. But now, by choosing to face this, to work through it, I'm taking back some control. I'm deciding how this story goes from here on out. It's terrifying, but also... exciting? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How does this shift your perspective?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's helping me see that I'm not defined by what happened to me. I'm more than just an ex-cult member or a trauma survivor. I'm a person who's been through something awful but is still here, still fighting. And maybe... maybe I can use this experience to help others somehow. I don't know exactly how yet, but the idea that something good could come from all this pain... it gives me a sense of purpose, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel physically now?",
    "Client: You know, it's funny. As we've been talking, I've noticed my body starting to relax a bit. The knot in my stomach is loosening, and my breathing feels easier. I'm still shaky, but it's more like... like the trembling after a hard workout, if that makes sense? Like I've done something difficult but worthwhile.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What does this tell you about your resilience?",
    "Client: I... wow. I guess it shows that I'm stronger than I often give myself credit for. That I can face these memories, feel all these intense emotions, and still come out the other side. Not unscathed, maybe, but... intact. Whole. It's like... like I'm reclaiming pieces of myself that I thought were lost forever. It's exhausting, but also... kind of amazing.",
    "Therapist: How might this impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be more present, more engaged. For so long, I've been living with one foot in the past, always on guard, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. But if I can face the worst of my memories here and survive it, maybe I can start to trust that I'm safe in the present. Maybe I can start to fully inhabit my life again, you know? Enjoy my relationships, my work, without this constant shadow hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How does it feel to consider that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and a little scary. The idea of living without that constant fear and vigilance - it's what I've wanted for so long, but it's also unfamiliar territory. It's like... like I'm standing on the edge of something new, something better, but taking that step forward is still daunting. But I think I'm ready. Or at least, I'm ready to try.",
