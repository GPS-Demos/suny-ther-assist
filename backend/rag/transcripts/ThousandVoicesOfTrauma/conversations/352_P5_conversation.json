    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit nervous, I guess. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that animal attack... it's making my stomach churn already.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so much time trying to forget what happened. The thought of purposely bringing it all back up feels counterintuitive. And scary. Really scary. I'm worried I might lose control or... I don't know, have some kind of breakdown.",
    "Therapist: Your fears are valid. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe by facing it head-on, I could start to process it better? But I'm still not sure. It's like, I know logically it might help, but emotionally, I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It's about processing. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will we spend on this? And what if I can't handle it? What if I freeze up or... or have a panic attack? I mean, I already struggle with anxiety, and this seems like it could make it so much worse.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control. What else worries you?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about disappointing you if I can't do it. And... I'm scared of how I'll feel afterwards. Will this make my nightmares worse? Will I be able to function normally after the session?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll work through this together. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes. I mean, I'm still scared, but I trust you. And I want to get better. I'm tired of letting this control my life. It's affecting my studies, my relationships... everything. So yes, I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes a deep breath* I can do this. I can do this. Just... don't leave me alone, okay?",
    "Therapist: I'm right here. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. *pause* It was a warm day. I was hiking alone, something I'd done a hundred times before. The trail was familiar, but somehow... different that day. Quieter. I remember thinking how peaceful it was, and then... *voice trembles* and then I heard the growl.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue at your own pace.",
    "Client: *breathing quickens* It... it happened so fast. One moment I was admiring the view, and the next... I was on the ground. The pain was... indescribable. I could feel its teeth, its claws... I thought I was going to die. I was so sure of it. *starts crying* I... I can't... This is too much.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm alright. It's just... it feels so real. Like it's happening all over again. But... but I know I'm here. I'm safe. It's over. *pause* Can... can we continue?",
    "Therapist: If you feel ready. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Yeah. Yeah, I want to keep going. I need to face this. *deep breath* After the attack, I somehow managed to get to my phone. I remember how slippery it was... my hands were covered in blood. My blood. I called for help, but I couldn't speak. I just... screamed. And then I passed out. The next thing I knew, I was in the hospital.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also... I don't know. There's a sense of relief, I guess? Like I've finally acknowledged what happened instead of trying to push it away. It's still terrifying, but... maybe a little less so? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common response. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do it. But I did. And you're right, I do feel a sense of accomplishment. It's strange... I feel exhausted but also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's a great analogy. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need some time to process all of this. But... I'm glad we did this. Thank you for guiding me through it. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm actually looking forward to it now. It's still scary, but... I can see how this helps. Thank you again. See you next week."
