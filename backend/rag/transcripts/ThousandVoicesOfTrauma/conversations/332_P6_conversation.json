    "Therapist: Alright, Ahmed. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my apartment, it's late at night. I'm sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone. Suddenly, I hear a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably a 4 out of 10. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue.",
    "Client: I freeze for a moment, then I hear footsteps. They're heavy, unfamiliar. I know someone's in my home. I'm paralyzed with fear, my throat feels tight. I can't breathe properly. The footsteps are getting closer, and I'm just sitting there, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My chest feels really tight, like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Then I see him. A man, dressed in black, wearing a mask. He's huge, towering over me. I can smell alcohol on him. He grabs me roughly, pushes me to the ground. I try to scream but no sound comes out. I'm shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: 8... maybe 9. This is really hard. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He... he starts touching me. His hands are everywhere. I'm crying silently, praying for it to end. I feel so helpless, so violated. The shame is overwhelming. I can't fight back, I'm too scared. It feels like it lasts forever.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Ahmed. Let's pause here. Take some deep breaths with me.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit better. Maybe down to an 8. But I still feel so ashamed and angry at myself for not fighting back.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are common. Remember, you survived. That's what matters.",
    "Client: I guess. It's just... I feel so weak when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: You're not weak. You're here, facing this trauma. That takes immense strength.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer now. Maybe a 6 on the SUDS scale.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What do you notice in your body as you calm down?",
    "Client: My breathing is slowing down. The tightness in my chest is easing a bit. My hands are still shaky though.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's end the exercise here. You did excellent work today, Ahmed.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but... I think it helped. I've never talked about it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something heavy. My SUDS is probably down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll work through this together, at your pace."
