    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the natural disaster experience and provide an initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was during the monsoon season back home. The rain wouldn't stop for days. I remember standing on our balcony, watching the water rise... it was terrifying. The streets turned into rivers, and I could hear people screaming for help. I... I feel my heart racing just thinking about it. SUDS... maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Let's continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: The power went out, and everything went dark. The wind was howling, and I could hear things crashing outside. My family huddled together in one room. I remember feeling so helpless, like we might not make it through the night. The water started seeping in under the door, and I... I just froze. I couldn't move or think clearly. My hands are shaking now...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8? I can feel my chest tightening, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Right, I'm safe... The water kept rising, and we had to move to the roof. I remember the look of fear in my parents' eyes. I felt like I had failed them somehow, like I should've been able to protect them. We spent hours up there, soaked to the bone, watching our neighborhood disappear under the flood. I can still smell the damp, musty air...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7.5? My stomach is in knots, but talking about it... it's like I'm starting to see it from a distance.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: As dawn broke, we saw the full extent of the damage. Houses were partially submerged, debris everywhere. The silence was eerie, broken only by distant cries for help. I felt so guilty... why were we spared when others weren't? I remember thinking, \"This is what the end of the world looks like.\" My hands are clammy now, and I feel a bit dizzy...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 6 now? I still feel anxious, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I'm finally facing this memory head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Continue.",
    "Client: The rescue teams arrived later that day. I remember the sound of helicopters overhead. As we were being evacuated, I saw bodies being pulled from the water. It was... horrifying. But I also felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching it all happen to someone else. Now, talking about it, I feel a mix of sadness and... maybe acceptance? My breathing is steadier now.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: I think it's down to a 5. I still feel emotional, but it's not overwhelming anymore. It's like... I'm acknowledging what happened without being consumed by it. My shoulders feel less tense, and the knot in my stomach has loosened a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I feel... surprised, actually. And a little proud. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still painful, but it feels... manageable now. Like I'm starting to take control of the memory instead of it controlling me. My hands have stopped shaking, and I feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic. Let's wrap up. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. Thank you for guiding me through this. I never thought I'd be able to face these memories, but... I did it. And I think I'm ready to do it again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. We'll end here for today."
