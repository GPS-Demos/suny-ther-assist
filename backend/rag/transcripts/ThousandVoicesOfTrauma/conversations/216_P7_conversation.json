    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my childhood trauma and the loss of my grandmother, and it's making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing. My grandmother was everything to me. She raised me after my parents passed away when I was young. Losing her felt like losing my whole world all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take your time.",
    "Client: It happened when I was 15. I remember coming home from school and finding her collapsed on the kitchen floor. I... I didn't know what to do. I called for help, but by the time the ambulance arrived, it was too late. I keep replaying that moment in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see her lying there, so still. The kitchen tiles were cold under my knees as I knelt beside her. I can smell the soup she was making - it was still on the stove. I remember shaking her, calling out \"Ah Ma, Ah Ma, please wake up.\" But she didn't respond. Her skin felt cool to the touch. I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling so helpless. I didn't know CPR or anything that could help. I just sat there, holding her hand and crying until the paramedics arrived. They tried to revive her, but... (voice breaks) I knew she was gone. I felt so alone in that moment. It was like my whole world had shattered.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: After that, everything's a blur. Social services came, and I was placed in foster care. But nothing felt right anymore. I withdrew from everyone and everything. I couldn't shake the feeling that I had failed her somehow. That if I had been there earlier, or if I had known what to do, maybe she would still be alive.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The guilt... it's been with me ever since. I threw myself into my studies and work, trying to make her proud, trying to prove that her sacrifice in raising me wasn't wasted. But deep down, I've always felt this emptiness, this fear of getting close to anyone again. What if I lose them too? What if I fail them like I failed her?",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My chest feels tight, and I can feel tears coming. But also... there's a strange sense of relief in talking about it. I've kept this bottled up for so long. I miss her so much, and I wish I could tell her how sorry I am, how much I loved her, how grateful I am for everything she did for me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I've never really allowed myself to grieve properly. I always felt like I had to be strong, to keep moving forward. But now, talking about it, I realize how much pain I've been carrying. It's like a weight I've been bearing all these years, and only now am I starting to let it go.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How does it feel to share this?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and liberating. I feel vulnerable, but also like I'm finally facing something I've been running from for decades. I'm realizing that maybe... maybe it wasn't my fault. I was just a kid, and I did everything I could. Perhaps it's time I forgive myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I think... I think my grandmother would want that for me. She always encouraged me to be kind to myself. I've spent so long trying to make her proud, but maybe the best way to honor her memory is to heal, to allow myself to be happy. It's what she would have wanted.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful thought. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter. There's still sadness, but it's not as overwhelming. For the first time in years, I feel like maybe I can move forward without this crushing guilt. I want to remember her with love and gratitude, not just pain and regret.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart. But I feel... I feel like I've taken a step towards healing. It's scary, but also... hopeful. I think I'm ready to start working on letting go of this guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today."
