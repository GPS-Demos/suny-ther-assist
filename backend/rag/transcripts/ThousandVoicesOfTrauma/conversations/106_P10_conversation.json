    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to dive in, but another part is hesitant. It's like there's this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. The fluorescent lights are so bright, and there's this antiseptic smell that's making me nauseous. My wife, Maria, is sitting next to me. Her hand is squeezing mine so tight it almost hurts.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The doctor just called us in. We're following him down this long corridor. My heart is racing. I can hear the beeping of machines and distant voices. We enter a small office, and... and... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Stay with it. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. Maybe 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The doctor sits us down. He's looking at some papers, and I can tell by his face it's not good news. He starts talking, but it's like I can't hear him clearly. Everything's muffled. Then I catch the words \"stage 4\" and \"aggressive,\" and suddenly everything snaps into focus.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I can't breathe properly. It's like there's this weight pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Focus on that feeling. Allow yourself to experience it fully. What happens next?",
    "Client: Maria starts crying. I want to comfort her, but I'm frozen. The doctor is still talking, mentioning treatment options, but all I can think is \"This can't be happening. Not to us. Not now.\" We just got married. We were talking about starting a family...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. At the world, at God, at myself. Why didn't I notice something was wrong sooner? Maybe if we'd caught it earlier... (voice breaks) I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay. I'm... I'm still in the doctor's office. He's handing us some pamphlets, talking about support groups. But all I can focus on is Maria. She looks so small, so fragile. I've never seen her like this before.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to run. Just get out of there and pretend none of this is happening. But I can't. I have to be strong for Maria. So I just sit there, nodding, pretending I'm taking in what the doctor is saying.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to stay there instead of running?",
    "Client: It's... it's excruciating. Like I'm being torn apart from the inside. But also... I don't know, there's a small part of me that feels... proud? That I'm not falling apart completely.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What happens as you leave the office?",
    "Client: We walk out, and it's like the world has changed. Everything looks different. People in the waiting room are just going about their day, and I want to scream at them. Don't they know our world just shattered?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: We get to the car, and that's when I break down. I start sobbing, and Maria... she holds me. Even though she's the one who's sick, she's comforting me. I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to need comfort, Carlos. How does Maria respond to your emotions?",
    "Client: She's... she's amazing. She just holds me and tells me we'll get through this together. But I can see the fear in her eyes, and it kills me that I can't take it away.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after that moment in the car?",
    "Client: We drive home in silence. The radio is on, but I can't make out the words. It's just noise. When we get home, I go straight to our bedroom and just sit on the edge of the bed. I feel numb.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about all our plans. The house we wanted to buy, the kids we talked about having. It all seems so far away now. And I'm angry at myself for thinking about that when Maria is the one who's sick.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those thoughts. How does your body feel as you sit there?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like I'm made of lead. My shoulders are slumped, and I can't seem to lift my head. I hear Maria in the kitchen, probably making tea or something. She always does that when she's stressed.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to go to her, to hold her, to tell her everything will be okay. But I can't move. I'm paralyzed by fear and guilt.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: Maria comes into the bedroom. She sits next to me and takes my hand. We don't speak for a long time. Then she says, \"We'll fight this.\" And I... I break down again. But this time, it feels different. Like we're in this together.",
    "Therapist: How does that moment of connection feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm terrified of losing her, but I'm also in awe of her strength. I feel closer to her than ever before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. What happens after that?",
    "Client: We start making calls. To our families, to our jobs. It's surreal, having to say the words out loud. Each time I say it, it becomes more real. My mom starts crying on the phone, and I have to be the strong one. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do you manage those conversations?",
    "Client: I... I put on a brave face. I tell them we have a plan, that we're optimistic. But inside, I'm screaming. I feel like a fraud.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. Talking about it... it's helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue. What happens as the day goes on?",
    "Client: We start researching. Looking up treatment options, success rates. Maria is methodical, making lists and plans. I'm in awe of her, but also... I feel useless. Like I should be doing more.",
    "Therapist: What do you do with that feeling of uselessness?",
    "Client: I... I throw myself into practical tasks. Making appointments, organizing our schedules. It feels good to be doing something, anything. But there's this underlying panic that I can't shake.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're doing these tasks?",
    "Client: Tense. My jaw is clenched, and my shoulders are up to my ears. I keep catching myself holding my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath now. What happens as night falls?",
    "Client: We go to bed, but neither of us can sleep. We're lying there in the dark, and I can hear Maria's breathing. It sounds normal, and for a moment, I can pretend everything is okay. But then reality crashes back in.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified of losing her. Of being alone. And I feel guilty for thinking about myself when she's the one facing this illness. I keep wondering if I'll be strong enough to support her through this.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid concerns. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. Talking about it... it's helping. It doesn't feel as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Let's start wrapping up. How do you feel now, thinking back on that day?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but... I can see how far we've come. We're still fighting, still together. And I'm... I'm proud of us. Of how we've handled it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Is there anything else you want to share about that day?",
    "Client: Just... how grateful I am for Maria. For her strength, her love. It's been hard, but it's also brought us closer in ways I never imagined.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Carlos. You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but also relieved. Like a weight has been lifted. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session."
