    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the accident scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving down the highway. It's late, around 11 PM. The road is dark, and there's a light drizzle. I'm tired from work, but I wanted to get home. Suddenly, I see headlights coming straight at me in my lane. My heart starts racing, and I grip the steering wheel tighter.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car is getting closer, and I realize it's not moving back to its lane. I try to swerve, but everything happens so fast. There's a deafening crash, and I feel my body jolt violently. The airbag deploys, hitting me in the face. I can taste blood in my mouth, and there's a sharp pain in my chest. I'm disoriented, and the world is spinning.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can hear screaming. I think it's coming from the other car. I want to help, but I can't move. My legs are pinned, and every breath hurts. I smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm terrified the car might explode. I try to call for help, but my voice is weak. I feel so helpless, just trapped there, waiting...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Minutes feel like hours. I hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. I'm relieved but also scared about how badly I'm hurt. The firefighters arrive first. They're talking to me, but I can barely focus. They start cutting the car to get me out. The sound of metal grinding is overwhelming. When they finally pull me out, the pain is excruciating. I think I passed out then.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I wake up in the hospital. Everything is a blur of bright lights and beeping machines. Doctors are rushing around, and I catch phrases like \"internal bleeding\" and \"possible spinal injury.\" I'm terrified I might be paralyzed. They're asking me questions, but I can barely speak. I keep thinking about the other driver, wondering if they're alive. The guilt is overwhelming, even though I know it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a haze of pain and confusion. I have multiple surgeries. Every time I wake up, I hope it's all been a bad dream, but the pain reminds me it's real. My wife is there, looking worried and exhausted. I feel guilty for putting her through this. The doctors tell me I'll recover, but I'll have chronic pain. I feel angry and scared about how this will change my life. Will I ever be the same? Will I be able to work? To enjoy life? The uncertainty is almost as painful as the physical injuries.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Reliving it... it's intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I'm finally facing it instead of trying to push it away. It's still painful, but maybe a bit less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I think it's helping. I've avoided thinking about the accident for so long, always changing the subject when it came up. But facing it like this, it feels like I'm taking back some control. I'm still scared about the future, about the chronic pain, but I feel a little stronger now. Like maybe I can handle it better than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. After I was released from the hospital, coming home was both a relief and a challenge. Everything felt different. Simple tasks became monumental. I needed help with basic things like getting dressed or preparing meals. It was frustrating and humiliating. I've always been independent, and suddenly I felt like a burden. My wife was supportive, but I could see the strain on her. We had to rearrange our entire house to accommodate my needs. It was a constant reminder of how much had changed.",
    "Therapist: You're navigating this difficult experience well.",
    "Client: The pain was constant, a nagging presence that never quite went away. Some days were better than others, but it was always there. I started physical therapy, which was its own kind of challenge. Every small improvement felt like a victory, but there were also setbacks that left me feeling defeated. I struggled with depression, feeling like I'd lost my old self. I withdrew from friends and family, partly because I didn't want them to see me like this, and partly because I was angry at the world.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the nightmares. They started a few weeks after the accident. I'd relive the crash over and over, sometimes with even worse outcomes. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding. It affected my sleep, which made the pain worse, creating a vicious cycle. I felt like I was losing control of my mind as well as my body. There were times I wondered if I'd ever feel normal again, if I'd ever be able to drive without panicking or sleep through the night without reliving the trauma.",
    "Therapist: You're showing courage in facing these memories.",
    "Client: Gradually, things started to improve. The physical therapy began to show results. I could do more for myself, which helped my mood. I started seeing a therapist, which helped me process my emotions and fears. Slowly, I began to reconnect with friends and family. Their support meant more than I could express. I still had bad days, but they became less frequent. I started to see a future for myself again, even if it was different from what I had imagined before the accident.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Talking through it all, from the accident to the recovery, it's like I can see the whole journey. Yes, there's still pain and challenges, but I can also see how far I've come. I'm not the same person I was before the accident, but maybe that's okay. I've learned things about myself, about resilience and the importance of support. It's still hard, but I feel more hopeful than I have in a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand my experience better now, and that gives me some peace. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it might be challenging. Thank you for guiding me through this."
