    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of Carlos yelling at me and throwing things... it's like I was right back there. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. I remembered how terrified I was, not knowing if he would actually hit me this time. And the shame... I kept thinking, \"How did I let things get this bad?\" I could almost smell his cologne mixed with alcohol. It's strange how vivid these details are now.",
    "Therapist: You're noticing a lot. How does it compare to when you usually think about this memory?",
    "Client: It's... clearer, I guess? Usually, I try to push it away as soon as it pops up. But going through it like this, I'm noticing things I hadn't before. Like how tightly I was gripping the kitchen counter, or the exact words he used. It's uncomfortable, but also... I don't know, maybe helpful?",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... by facing it head-on, I'm starting to see it for what it really was. Not just this big, scary blob in my mind, but a specific event with a beginning and an end. And I survived it. I'm here now, talking about it. That feels... significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: It is significant. How do you think this relates to your overall recovery?",
    "Client: I guess it's showing me that I can face these memories without falling apart. And maybe... maybe if I can do that, I can start to let go of some of the fear I still carry with me. Like, I don't have to be on high alert all the time, expecting every man to turn into Carlos.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much anger I still have. Not just at Carlos, but at myself for staying as long as I did. But there's also this... I don't know, pride? That I eventually found the strength to leave. It's a weird mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have conflicting feelings. How are you managing them?",
    "Client: It's tough. Part of me wants to push it all away again, but I know that's not helpful. I'm trying to just... let the feelings be there without judging them. Like we've practiced. It's hard, but I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. What's helping you continue?",
    "Client: Honestly? Knowing that I'm not alone in this. Having you guide me through it, and remembering that other people have gone through similar things and come out stronger. And... I want to be able to trust again, to have healthy relationships. I guess that's my big motivation.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I'm committed. Each session, even though it's difficult, I feel like I'm reclaiming a bit of myself. It's exhausting, but also... freeing? I want to keep going. I need to.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Any final thoughts today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me through this. I never thought I'd be able to talk about these things without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not there yet, but... I think I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress, Maria. We'll continue next week."
