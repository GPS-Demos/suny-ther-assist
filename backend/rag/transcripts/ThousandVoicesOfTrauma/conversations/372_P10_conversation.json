    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. It's not easy to talk about this stuff.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 out of 10. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, you're safe here. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital waiting room. The lights are so bright, and there's this antiseptic smell that's making me nauseous. I can hear the beeping of machines in the distance. My mom is sitting next to me, she looks worried. We're waiting for the doctor to come out with my test results.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking, and I can't stop fidgeting. I keep thinking about how I've been feeling so tired lately, and how the pain in my joints won't go away. What if it's something serious? What if I have to drop out of uni?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The door opens, and the doctor comes out. He looks serious, and my heart just drops. He asks us to come into his office. As we walk in, I can feel my legs getting weak. The office is small and cluttered with medical textbooks. There's a skeleton model in the corner that I can't stop staring at.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My palms are sweaty, and I'm gripping the armrests of the chair so hard my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The doctor starts talking, using all these medical terms I don't understand. But I catch phrases like \"chronic condition\" and \"lifelong management.\" My mom starts crying silently next to me. I feel... I feel like the room is spinning. This can't be happening to me. I'm only 21, for God's sake!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... this is it. My life is over before it's even started. How am I going to finish my degree? Will I ever be able to have a normal relationship? What if I become a burden to everyone around me?",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor is still talking, but I can barely hear him over the sound of blood rushing in my ears. He's saying something about treatment options and lifestyle changes. But all I can think about is how everything is going to change. My studies, my social life, my future career... everything seems so uncertain now.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel like I might throw up. And there's this pressure in my head, like it might explode. I... I want to run out of the room, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe.",
    "Client: Right... okay. In the memory, the doctor finishes talking and hands us some pamphlets. My mom is asking questions, but I can't focus on what she's saying. I'm just staring at the floor, trying not to cry. I feel so... so powerless. Like my body has betrayed me.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Anger. Frustration. Fear. It's not fair! Why me? What did I do to deserve this? I'm supposed to be in the prime of my life, and instead, I'm facing a lifetime of pain and doctor's appointments.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: As we're leaving the doctor's office, I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror. I look pale and shocked. It's like I'm looking at a stranger. We walk back through the waiting room, and I see other patients waiting. Some of them look so sick, and I realize... I'm one of them now. I'm not just a normal uni student anymore. I'm a patient. Someone with a chronic condition.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel like I've lost a part of my identity. Like I've aged 50 years in the span of an hour. There's this heaviness in my chest, a mix of grief and fear for the future.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: We get to the car park, and the sun is so bright it hurts my eyes. Everything looks different now, like the world has shifted on its axis. My mom is trying to comfort me, saying we'll get through this together, but her words feel hollow. All I can think about is how I'm going to tell my girlfriend, my friends. Will they treat me differently? Will they still want to be around me?",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared of being a burden. Of being pitied. I've always been the strong one, you know? The one who has it all together. And now... now I feel so vulnerable. So exposed. It's like everyone will be able to see that I'm broken somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit... maybe a 7 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also kind of releasing something.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: We drive home in silence. I'm staring out the window, watching the world go by. People walking, laughing, going about their day. And I'm sitting here, feeling like my world has ended. When we get home, I go straight to my room. I can hear my mom on the phone, probably telling my dad. And I just... I break down. I cry like I haven't cried since I was a kid. It's like... like mourning for the life I thought I was going to have.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My chest hurts from crying so hard. My eyes are burning. I feel drained, like all the energy has been sucked out of me. But there's also this... this strange calm. Like after a storm.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I spend the next few days in a daze. I don't go to uni, I don't answer my phone. I just... exist. My parents are tiptoeing around me, trying to be supportive but not really knowing how. I start researching my condition online, which probably isn't the best idea. Some of the stories I read... they're terrifying. But others... others give me a glimmer of hope. People who've learned to live with their condition, who've found ways to thrive despite it.",
    "Therapist: How does reading those stories affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. On one hand, I'm scared of what the future might hold. On the other, I'm starting to realize that maybe... maybe this isn't the end. Maybe it's just a different path than the one I thought I'd be on.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's helping. It doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did at first.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After a few days, I finally work up the courage to tell my girlfriend. I'm so nervous, my hands are shaking as I dial her number. When I tell her, there's this long pause, and I'm terrified she's going to break up with me. But then... then she starts crying. She says she wishes she could be there to hug me, that we'll face this together. And for the first time since the diagnosis, I feel... I feel like maybe I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant moment. How did it make you feel?",
    "Client: It was... it was a relief. Like a weight had been lifted. I realized that maybe I didn't have to go through this alone. That there were people who would stand by me, even when things got tough.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit more hopeful. Don't get me wrong, I'm still scared. The future still feels uncertain. But it's like... like I can see a tiny light at the end of the tunnel now. It's not all darkness anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4 now. Talking about it... it's helping me process everything.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. It's been intense, but I feel like I've gotten a lot out of it. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to practice self-care for the rest of the day."
