    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the home invasion incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at home, alone. It was late evening, around 9 PM. I was in the living room, reading a book when I heard a noise from the kitchen. At first, I thought it might be the cat, but then I heard footsteps. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I froze in my seat, trying to be as quiet as possible. The footsteps were getting closer. I could hear them in the hallway now. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move. My whole body was shaking. Then, I saw a shadow in the doorway...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It was a man. He was tall, wearing dark clothes and a mask. When he saw me, he rushed towards me. I screamed and tried to get up, but I stumbled and fell. He grabbed me by the arm, so tight it hurt. I could smell alcohol on his breath...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: He demanded money and jewelry. His voice was rough, angry. I couldn't stop crying. I told him where my purse was, but he didn't let go of me. He dragged me through the house, making me show him where I kept valuables. I felt so helpless, so violated...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Every room we entered, he ransacked. Drawers pulled out, contents spilled everywhere. All the while, he kept threatening me, saying he'd hurt me if I didn't cooperate. I was terrified he'd kill me. I kept thinking about my children, how they'd cope if something happened to me...",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like hours, but was probably only minutes, he pushed me into a closet. He told me if I came out or called anyone, he'd come back and kill me. I heard him leave, but I was too scared to move. I stayed in that dark, cramped closet for so long, shaking and crying...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel scared. My heart is racing, just like it did that night. But I also feel angry. Angry that he took away my sense of safety in my own home. I still struggle to feel secure, even now...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Eventually, I found the courage to leave the closet and call the police. But even after they came, I couldn't stop shaking. I felt so exposed, so vulnerable. I couldn't stay in that house anymore. I moved in with my sister for a while after that...",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel about sharing this?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But... I also feel a bit relieved. Like I'm finally facing it instead of running from the memory. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still overwhelming sometimes. I have nightmares about it, and I'm always double-checking locks. But talking about it... it feels like I'm taking some control back. Like I'm not letting him win by keeping me silent.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You're doing wonderfully.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... it's changed so much. I used to love being home alone, enjoying the quiet. Now, every little noise makes me jump. I hate feeling this way, but I'm trying to work through it.",
    "Therapist: Your efforts are commendable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for so long. It's still scary, but maybe a little less so now that I've talked about it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to stop for now. This has been intense, but I'm glad we did it. Can we talk about some coping strategies for when I feel anxious at home?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done incredibly well today. Let's discuss those strategies."
