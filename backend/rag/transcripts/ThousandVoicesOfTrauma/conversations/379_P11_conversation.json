    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The wind, the noise, the fear... it all feels so real again. I can still hear the creaking of the house, wondering if it was going to collapse on us.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember huddling in the bathroom with my neighbor and her kids, trying to stay calm for them, but inside I was terrified. I kept thinking about how I couldn't do anything to stop the cyclone, to protect us. It brought back memories of... of feeling powerless in other situations.",
    "Therapist: How did that feeling of helplessness compare to other experiences?",
    "Client: It was... different, but similar, if that makes sense? With the cyclone, it was nature, something huge and unstoppable. But it reminded me of times when I felt trapped and powerless with my ex-husband. The same fear, the same feeling of having no control.",
    "Therapist: I see. How are you coping with those emotions now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe now, that both the cyclone and my ex are in the past. But my heart is still racing, and I feel on edge. I keep wanting to check the weather, make sure there are no storms coming.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What helps you feel grounded?",
    "Client: Taking deep breaths helps a bit. And... and reminding myself of where I am now. My apartment, my job, my friends. The life I've built since then. It's like... anchoring myself in the present.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent strategy. How else has this process been for you?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But... I think it's helping? I noticed today that I was able to stay with the memory a bit longer before feeling overwhelmed. And talking about it afterwards, like this... it helps me make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. What do you think has contributed to that?",
    "Client: I guess... practice? And knowing that I'm safe here, that I can talk about it without judgment. It's still scary, but it feels less... all-consuming, maybe? Like I can look at it from a bit of distance now.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your overall recovery goals?",
    "Client: I want to feel in control of my life again, not controlled by these memories or fears. This... this helps me face them, understand them. It's like... reclaiming my story, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, but... I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I don't want to be afraid of storms or loud noises or... or being close to people. I want to be able to help others in emergencies without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: I think... that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face these memories and survive them. And that... that it's okay to be scared, but I don't have to let that fear control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable takeaway. How can you reinforce that this week?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could write it down somewhere I'll see it often? And practice those grounding techniques we talked about, especially when I start feeling anxious or overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone to talk to about all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Your hard work is paying off. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling... tired, but also a bit lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for a while. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's a great note to end on. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
