    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Well, doc, I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part... it's like my stomach's tied in knots. You know how it is when you're about to jump into cold water? That's how I feel right now.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you describe where you are in your memory?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm in the hospital. It's... it's that day when they told me about the cancer. The walls are this sickly pale green color, and there's this constant beeping from somewhere down the hall. I can smell disinfectant... it's making me feel a bit queasy.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening right now?",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the edge of this hard examination table. The paper crinkles every time I move. The doctor just walked in... he's got this serious look on his face. God, I remember thinking, \"This can't be good.\" My mouth is so dry...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6, I reckon.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take us through what happens next.",
    "Client: The doctor... he's not beating around the bush. He says, \"I'm afraid it's cancer, John.\" And just like that, the world stops. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. I'm... I'm trying to focus on what he's saying, but it's like I'm underwater. Everything's muffled.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest... it's so tight. I can barely breathe. My hands are gripping the edge of the table so hard, my knuckles are white. I feel cold... really cold. And alone. So damn alone.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor's still talking, but I'm not really hearing him. I'm thinking about my ex-wife... my kids. How am I going to tell them? And then... then I think about how I've wasted so much time. All those years drinking... (voice breaks) I could've been a better father, a better husband.",
    "Therapist: Stay present, John. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the doctor's face. He looks concerned, but also... detached? Like he's done this a hundred times before. There's a chart in his hands, and he's pointing at something, probably explaining the diagnosis. But all I can focus on is this poster on the wall behind him. It's about quitting smoking. Ironic, isn't it? I quit years ago, and here I am anyway.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Furious, actually. Why me? I've already been through so much shit in my life. The neglect from my parents, the failed marriage, the drinking... and now this? It's not fair. (voice rising) It's not fucking fair!",
    "Therapist: I hear your anger. It's okay to feel that way. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. My legs are shaky, but I'm standing. The doctor looks startled. I want to punch something, but instead... I just start crying. (voice breaks) I haven't cried in years, but now I can't stop. It's like a dam breaking.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (sobbing) I'm scared. I'm so scared. I don't want to die alone. I've pushed everyone away... who's going to be there for me now?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: The doctor... he's put his hand on my shoulder. He's saying something about treatment options, about how we caught it early. But all I can think about is how I'm going to face this alone. The room feels smaller somehow, like the walls are closing in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I sit back down. My legs feel like jelly. The doctor hands me some tissues and a glass of water. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold the glass. I take a sip, and it's like I'm tasting water for the first time. It's so cold, so real... it brings me back a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Focus on that sensation. What are you thinking now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my son. We haven't spoken in years, not since I missed his wedding because I was too drunk. But now... now all I want is to see him. To tell him I'm sorry. To ask for his help. (pauses) God, that's hard to admit.",
    "Therapist: It's brave of you to recognize that. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I ask the doctor about my chances. He starts talking about percentages and treatment plans. I'm trying to focus, to understand, but it's like my brain can't process it all. I keep nodding, but I'm not really there. I'm thinking about all the things I need to do... call my kids, sort out my will, maybe even try to reconnect with my ex-wife.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My body feels heavy, like I've run a marathon. But there's also this strange energy, like electricity running under my skin. I can't sit still. I keep fidgeting with the hem of my shirt.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're making progress. What happens as the appointment ends?",
    "Client: The doctor's wrapping things up. He's handing me a bunch of pamphlets, scheduling follow-up appointments. I'm nodding, but it's all a blur. As I stand up to leave, my legs are steadier now. I shake the doctor's hand... his grip is firm, reassuring. For a moment, I don't feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. How do you feel as you leave the room?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I've aged ten years in the span of an hour. But there's also... I don't know if 'hope' is the right word, but something like it. Like maybe this is a chance to make things right, to reconnect with my family before it's too late.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done really well today, John. How are you feeling now, back in the present?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, doc. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying. It's still there, but I feel like I can breathe a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Thanks, doc. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage today, John. We'll continue to work through this in our next session."
