    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My hands are a little clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and begin describing the hostage situation.",
    "Client: Alright... I was at the bank, just a routine visit. Suddenly, there was shouting. A man with a gun burst in, waving it around wildly. My heart started racing immediately. He was yelling at everyone to get down on the floor. I remember the cold tile against my cheek as I lay there, trembling.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's beating faster just thinking about it. The fear is coming back.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The gunman was pacing, sweating profusely. He kept muttering to himself. I could smell his sweat and it made me nauseous. Police sirens started wailing outside, and he became more agitated. He grabbed a young woman near me as a shield. I could hear her whimpering, and I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: The negotiator's voice came over a megaphone. The gunman was shouting back, his voice cracking. Hours passed. My body ached from lying still for so long. I was thirsty, scared, and angry all at once. When he finally surrendered, I couldn't believe it was over. My legs were so weak, I could barely stand.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The relief of walking out of that bank... but also the guilt. Why did I survive when others were hurt? I had nightmares for weeks. Loud noises would make me jump. I... I started drinking to numb the memories.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. My SUDS is probably a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause. Take some deep breaths with me.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... that helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you describe your surroundings now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in your office. The blue walls, the painting of the ocean. Your voice... it's grounding me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can. It's hard, but I want to get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After the incident, I couldn't go back to work for a while. I'd have panic attacks just thinking about leaving the house. My husband tried to understand, but I felt so alone. The drinking got worse. I'd wake up with terrible hangovers, feeling even more ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's at a 6 now. Talking about it... it's helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally sought help when my daughter confronted me about the drinking. It was a wake-up call. I realized I was letting that day control my entire life. That's when I decided to face my trauma head-on.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Surprisingly... better. My SUDS is down to a 4. I feel... lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that talking about it doesn't make it happen again. It's in the past. I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm working through it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. Let's end here. You did great today."
