    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all kind of jumbled up right now. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. It's like I'm right back there, you know? Seeing it all happen again. The shouting, the sound of glass breaking... I can still hear it so clearly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. I feel scared, like I did then. But there's also this overwhelming sadness. I keep thinking about how things used to be before that night, before everything fell apart. We were happy, or at least I thought we were. And now... now it's all gone. I feel like I've lost everything.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about those feelings of loss?",
    "Client: It's like... it's like a huge hole in my chest. I invested so much in our relationship, in our life together. We had plans, dreams. And now, it's not just the relationship that's gone, but also the future I thought I'd have. I feel so... so alone. Even though I know I have support, it's like I'm adrift in this sea of uncertainty. And I'm angry too. Angry at him, at myself, at the situation. Why did it have to happen like this?",
    "Therapist: I hear your pain. How do these emotions connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it all ties into this feeling of instability. Ever since that night, when I saw him... when I saw the violence, it's like my whole world became unstable. I don't trust my own judgment anymore. I mean, how could I have been so wrong about someone? And now, with the divorce, it's like another layer of instability. I'm trying to rebuild, but it feels like I'm doing it on quicksand. Every time I think I'm making progress, something triggers a memory or a feeling, and I'm right back there, feeling helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get a full breath. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is constantly on high alert, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. And I'm so tired. Just... bone-deep exhausted. But at the same time, I have trouble sleeping because my mind won't shut off. It keeps replaying that night, and all the what-ifs and should-haves.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these sensations affect your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... they're always there, lurking in the background. Some days are better than others, but it's like I can never fully relax. I'm always scanning for danger, even in places I know are safe. It affects my work - I have trouble concentrating, and sometimes I have to step away because it all becomes too much. And socially... well, I've withdrawn a lot. It's hard to explain to people what I'm going through, and I'm afraid of being a burden. Plus, there's this constant fear that if I let anyone get close again, I'll end up hurt like before.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. What thoughts come up when you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Is this my fault?\" \"Could I have prevented it?\" \"Will I ever feel normal again?\" There's this constant loop of self-doubt and second-guessing. And then there's the fear - what if I can never trust anyone again? What if I'm too broken to have a healthy relationship in the future? I want to move forward, but it feels like I'm stuck in this moment, reliving it over and over. And then I feel guilty for not being able to just \"get over it\" like some people seem to think I should.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex thoughts. How do they relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I think they're both helping and hindering me. On one hand, recognizing these thoughts helps me understand why I react the way I do in certain situations. It gives me a starting point to work from. But on the other hand, they can be paralyzing. Sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back. I'm trying to challenge these thoughts, to remind myself that what happened wasn't my fault, that I'm doing the best I can. But it's hard. Really hard. Some days, just getting out of bed feels like a major accomplishment.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's the small victories. Days when I feel a little lighter, when I can laugh without feeling guilty. Moments when I realize I've gone hours without thinking about it. And... and this, actually. Being able to talk about it, to process it. It's painful, but it also feels like I'm doing something, like I'm actively working towards healing. And I have to believe that it will get better. That one day, this won't be the first thing I think about when I wake up. That I'll be able to trust again, to feel safe again. It's a small flame of hope, but I'm holding onto it with everything I've got.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly courageous. How can we nurture that hope?",
    "Client: I think... I think by continuing this work, as hard as it is. By acknowledging the progress I've made, even when it feels small. Maybe by setting small, achievable goals for myself? And by reminding myself that healing isn't linear. That it's okay to have bad days, as long as I don't let them define me. I want to focus on rebuilding my sense of self, separate from what happened. Maybe... maybe even start thinking about what I want for my future, instead of just trying to survive the present.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. What's one step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to try reconnecting with a friend. Someone I've been avoiding because I was afraid of being vulnerable. Maybe just a coffee or a short walk. Something low-pressure, but a step towards rebuilding my social connections. And... and maybe start a journal? To track my thoughts and feelings, to see the progress over time. It might help on those days when I feel like I'm not moving forward.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up. There's still a lot to process, and I know it won't be easy. But I feel a little more grounded, a little more in control. And talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming, less like this big, dark secret I'm carrying alone. I'm nervous about the steps ahead, but also... maybe a little excited? Like I can see a path forward, even if it's still a bit foggy.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this. It means more than I can express. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get there. It's scary, but also... hopeful. I'm looking forward to our next session, to continue this work.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
