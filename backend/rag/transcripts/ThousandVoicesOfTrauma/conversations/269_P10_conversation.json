    "Therapist: Good morning, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Martinez. I'm... I'm feeling a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and it's making my stomach churn a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I think so. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) I'm... I'm standing outside my apartment building in Santiago. The air feels thick, almost electric. There's this eerie silence, you know? Like the whole city is holding its breath.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's early evening, maybe 6 or 7 PM. The sky has this weird orangey-gray color. I remember thinking it looked like the end of the world.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I feel the ground start to shake. It's gentle at first, but then... Dios m\u00edo, it just keeps getting stronger. I can hear car alarms going off all around me. People are starting to come out of their buildings, looking confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 5? It's uncomfortable, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I start to panic a little. I'm thinking about Mar\u00eda, my girlfriend. She's still at work downtown. I pull out my phone to call her, but the lines are jammed. The shaking is getting worse, and I can hear this awful groaning sound coming from the buildings.",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There's... there's chaos everywhere. People are screaming, running into the streets. I see a woman fall and hit her head on the curb. There's blood... (voice trembles) I want to help her, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're just observing. What do you notice next?",
    "Client: The... the ground is still shaking. It feels like it's been going on forever. I hear this horrible crashing sound and look up to see part of a building collapsing down the street. There's dust everywhere, and people are screaming... Oh God, I can still hear those screams...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Carlos. You're doing great. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe. I want to run, but I don't know where to go. Everything is moving, shaking. I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you survived this. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally snap out of it and start running towards downtown. I need to find Mar\u00eda. The streets are chaos. There are cracks in the pavement, overturned cars. I see people trapped under rubble, others trying to help them. I want to stop and help, but I can't... I can't stop thinking about Mar\u00eda.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is probably an 8. My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the ground here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I keep running. My legs are burning, but I can't stop. I pass by a collapsed school... there are kids crying, parents screaming. It's like a war zone. I finally reach Mar\u00eda's office building, and my heart stops. Half of it has collapsed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I... I feel like the world is ending. My mouth is dry, I can taste dust and fear. I'm screaming Mar\u00eda's name, but my voice sounds strange, far away. People are stumbling out of the building, covered in dust and blood. I can't see her anywhere.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Remember, you're here in my office, safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start digging through the rubble with my bare hands. My fingers are bleeding, but I don't care. I keep calling for Mar\u00eda. Hours pass, it's getting dark. Emergency services are arriving, but it's not enough. There are too many people who need help.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel broken. Hopeless. The city I love is in ruins, and I don't know if Mar\u00eda is alive or... (voice breaks) I can't do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here. Can you tell me one thing you see in my office right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the plant on your windowsill. The green leaves.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happens next?",
    "Client: (Sighs) I... I keep searching. All night. My hands are raw, my throat is hoarse from calling her name. As the sun comes up, I hear someone shout that they've found survivors in the basement. My heart leaps. I rush over, and... and there she is. Mar\u00eda. She's covered in dust, bleeding from a cut on her forehead, but she's alive.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Relief. Overwhelming relief. But also... guilt. So many others didn't make it. Why did we?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6, I think. My heart is still racing, but I feel... I feel like I can breathe again.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after you find Mar\u00eda?",
    "Client: We... we hold each other and cry. Around us, the rescue efforts are continuing. The air is filled with dust and the sound of sirens. We start helping others, pulling people from the rubble. It feels like we're in a nightmare that won't end.",
    "Therapist: How long does this go on?",
    "Client: Days. Weeks, really. The aftershocks keep coming. We sleep in the streets because it's not safe to go inside. Food and water become scarce. The whole city smells like dust and death. But people... people come together. Neighbors help each other. We start to rebuild, little by little.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind during this time?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... how fragile everything is. How quickly life can change. I have nightmares every night, reliving the quake. Every time the ground shakes, even a little, I panic. I feel... I feel like I'm constantly waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. How are you feeling now, as you recount this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My SUDS is probably around a 5 now. It's still painful to remember, but... but I feel like I can talk about it without falling apart. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work today, Carlos. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I feel drained, but also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after these sessions. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Sure. I see... your plant, the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the box of tissues, and the clock on your bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my jeans, my watch, and... the smooth surface of my wedding ring.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and some kind of air freshener. Lavender, maybe?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you taste?",
    "Client: The lingering mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Very good, Carlos. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... more present. More grounded. The memories are still there, but they feel less... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember to use these grounding techniques if you feel anxious between sessions. Do you have any questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. Thank you, Dr. Martinez. This was hard, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care, Carlos.",
    "Client: Gracias, Doctor. Hasta la pr\u00f3xima."
