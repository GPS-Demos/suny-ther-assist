    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I was right back there, you know? Watching that building collapse during the earthquake... I can still hear the rumbling and the screams. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. There were people inside that building, and I couldn't do anything. I just stood there, frozen. I'm wondering if... if I could have done something, anything, to help. Maybe if I had reacted faster or... I don't know. It's like my mind is racing with all these \"what ifs.\"",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty, I guess. And scared. It's like this overwhelming sense of dread that something like that could happen again at any moment. I know it's not rational, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm always in danger now. And then I feel angry at myself for feeling this way. I should be stronger than this, right?",
    "Therapist: There's no \"should\" about how you feel. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing how much this experience has changed me. Before the earthquake, I was this carefree college student, you know? Now I'm constantly on edge. I check the news obsessively for any signs of seismic activity. I've mapped out every possible escape route from my apartment, my classes, everywhere I go. It's exhausting living like this, but I can't seem to stop.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these changes impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me sad, honestly. I miss who I used to be. I want to feel safe again, to be able to walk into a building without wondering if it's going to come crashing down around me. But at the same time, part of me feels like I need to stay vigilant. Like if I let my guard down, something terrible will happen. It's this constant internal battle.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense. I just realized I've been clenching my jaw this whole time. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is always braced for impact, you know? Always ready to run or... I don't know, brace myself against a wall or something. God, it's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to breathe. Just... give me a second.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. What small step could you take?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try to go one day without checking the seismic activity reports? That feels terrifying to even consider, but I know it's not healthy, what I'm doing. Or perhaps I could talk to someone else who went through the earthquake. I've been avoiding that, scared of triggering more memories, but maybe it would help to know I'm not alone in feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful ideas. How do you feel about them?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like, for the first time, I can see a tiny light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. It's scary to think about changing my routines, even if they're not healthy ones. But I'm also tired of living in constant fear. I want to reclaim some part of my old self, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk about this, my breathing has slowed down a bit. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. And I'm realizing that even though remembering the earthquake was really intense and scary, I got through it. I'm here, talking about it. Maybe that means I'm stronger than I give myself credit for?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... proud, I guess? And a little surprised. I've been so focused on how scared and messed up I feel, I didn't really stop to consider that surviving this and working through it takes strength. It doesn't fix everything, but it feels good to acknowledge that. Like maybe there's hope for me after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how I can start feeling safer in my daily life. Maybe we could talk about some coping strategies for when I start feeling overwhelmed? And I'd like to work on challenging some of these thoughts I have, like the constant feeling that danger is imminent. I know it won't be easy, but I think I'm ready to start taking those steps.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. It's scary, but... I want to get better. I want to feel like myself again, or at least a version of myself that can function without constant fear. I know it'll take time, but I'm willing to put in the work. Let's do this.",
