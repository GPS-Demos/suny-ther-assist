    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm back there again, you know? The cult compound, the smell of incense and sweat. I can almost feel the rough fabric of those robes we had to wear. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like... like I can't get enough air. I keep hearing the leader's voice in my head, that calm, hypnotic tone he used when he was about to... (pause) when he was about to punish someone.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"How could I have been so stupid?\" I was a successful professional, for crying out loud. But I fell for it all. Hook, line, and sinker. And now, even decades later, I'm still... I'm still afraid. Afraid that somehow, they'll find me. That I'll wake up one day and be back there.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a cold pit in my stomach. My shoulders are tense, like I'm bracing for a blow. I... I can almost feel the sting of the whip on my back. God, I haven't thought about that in years.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger. So much anger. At them, at myself. Shame, too. Deep, crushing shame. And grief... for the years I lost, for the person I used to be before all this. It's overwhelming, like a tidal wave.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been carrying this weight for so long. The anger, the shame - they've colored everything in my life. My relationships, my work, even how I see myself. It's like I've been living in the shadow of that experience, always looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's sad, really. But also, I feel a glimmer of something else. Maybe... hope? Like, by facing this head-on, I'm finally taking back some control. It's terrifying, but also... liberating, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of liberation feel?",
    "Client: It's strange. Like a weight lifting, ever so slightly. My breathing feels a bit easier. There's still fear, still anger, but... but also this tiny spark of strength. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: What does that spark of strength mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means that maybe I'm not as broken as I thought. That there's still a part of me that's resilient, that can heal. It's fragile, this feeling, but it's there. And that's... that's something to hold onto, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How do you want to nurture that spark?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to keep talking about this. Keep facing it. It's painful, God knows it's painful, but... but I can't keep running from it. Maybe by confronting these memories, I can start to... to reclaim parts of myself I thought I'd lost forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for too long. It's scary, but... but I think I'm ready to keep going. To see where this path leads.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. But here I am. It's... it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself in the present. To remind myself that I'm here, now, safe. That what happened is in the past, and I'm... I'm working towards a future where it doesn't control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Let's do that together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm here. I'm safe. And I'm... I'm going to be okay. One day at a time, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. One day at a time. We'll pick this up next week."
