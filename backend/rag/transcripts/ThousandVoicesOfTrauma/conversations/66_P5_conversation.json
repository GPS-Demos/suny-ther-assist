    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I'm... well, I suppose I'm a bit anxious. I've been thinking about this session all week, and I'm not quite sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Could you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit your traumatic memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit the memory? I... I'm not sure I'm ready for that. The thought of going back there, even in my mind, it's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. Many find it challenging at first. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm scared, to be honest. But I trust you, Doctor. If you think this will help, I'm willing to give it a try. It's just... well, I've spent so many years trying to forget. The idea of purposely remembering is... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can help reduce the memory's power over you.",
    "Client: I see. And you'll be here with me the whole time? I'm not sure I could face this alone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through it and provide support throughout the session.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I've been having more nightmares lately, especially since my wife passed. Do you think this might help with those too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it often helps reduce nightmares and other PTSD symptoms. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. I'm still nervous, but I'm ready to try. What exactly do I need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail, in the present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: In the present tense? That sounds... intense. Will I be able to stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime you need. Your comfort and safety are paramount.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. And afterwards? How might I feel?",
    "Therapist: You may feel emotionally drained. It's normal. We'll discuss coping strategies before you leave.",
    "Client: I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. It's helping me feel more prepared. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is a step towards healing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your patience and guidance. Let's begin."
