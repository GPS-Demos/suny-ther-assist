    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the police brutality incident was intense. I could almost feel the officer's hands on me again, you know? The fear, the helplessness... it all came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The shouting, the sirens... and my own voice pleading. I hadn't realized how vivid those sounds were in my memory. It's like they've been locked away, and now they're all I can hear.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those sounds today?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. But... also different. I mean, I'm here, safe in your office, but part of me was back there. It's strange, feeling scared but also knowing I'm okay now. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many find that contrast meaningful.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. I noticed something else too. When I was describing the officer's face, I realized I couldn't remember it clearly. It's always been this looming, terrifying presence in my mind, but today... it seemed less powerful somehow. Like, still scary, but not larger than life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. How do you interpret that change?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe it's because I'm finally facing it? Like, by talking about it, I'm taking some of its power away. It's not this big, nameless fear anymore. It's a real event that happened, and I survived it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll feel a bit less jumpy around police officers? I mean, I know not all of them are like the one who hurt me, but I've been avoiding them completely. Maybe I can start small, like not crossing the street every time I see one.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful goal. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I noticed how tense my body got during the exposure. My shoulders were up to my ears, and my fists were clenched. I'm always telling myself to relax, but I never realized how much tension I'm holding onto. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: It is exhausting. How might you address that tension?",
    "Client: I could try some of those breathing exercises we talked about? Maybe set reminders to check in with my body throughout the day. I've been so focused on just getting through each day that I haven't been paying attention to how I feel physically.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. Today was hard, but I feel like I understand myself a little better now. And knowing that I can talk about it without falling apart... that's huge for me. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thanks. You know, I've been thinking about maybe joining a support group. Hearing other people's stories might help me feel less alone in this. What do you think?",
    "Therapist: That could be very beneficial. How would you prepare for that?",
    "Client: I guess I'd need to work on opening up more. Maybe practice sharing parts of my story here first? And definitely use those grounding techniques we've been working on. I'm nervous about it, but also kind of excited to connect with others who might understand.",
    "Therapist: That's a great approach. Shall we discuss this more next time?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I feel drained now, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many clients report similar feelings. It's a good sign.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I know we're out of time, but I wanted to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
