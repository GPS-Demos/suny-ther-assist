    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 right now. Just thinking about revisiting that day makes my stomach clench a bit.",
    "Therapist: Noted. Let's begin when you're ready. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It's a Tuesday morning. I'm at the bank, waiting in line to deposit a check. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I'm wishing I'd brought a sweater. There's soft muzak playing overhead, and the tellers are calling out numbers. I'm number 43, and they're only on 37. I'm getting a bit impatient, tapping my foot...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. At first, I think someone's dropped something heavy, but then I hear shouting. \"Everybody down! This is a robbery!\" My heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I drop to the floor, my knees hitting the cold tile hard. I can see shoes moving quickly, hear more shouting...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking, and I can feel sweat breaking out all over my body. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping they won't notice me. Oh god, I can smell gunpowder now. They've fired a shot into the ceiling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",

    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay... One of the robbers is shouting at the tellers, demanding money. Another one is walking among us, the hostages. I can hear crying and whimpering all around me. The robber near us kicks someone who's sobbing too loudly. I flinch at the sound, squeezing my eyes shut tighter. I'm... I'm so scared they'll hurt me too.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: Time seems to stretch on forever. My legs are cramping from staying still for so long. I can hear police sirens outside now, and the robbers are getting agitated. They're arguing amongst themselves. One of them grabs a young woman near me and drags her to her feet. She's screaming, and I... I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I feel so helpless, so weak...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police are trying to negotiate now. I can hear a voice over a megaphone, but I can't make out the words. The robbers are shouting back, threatening to hurt us if their demands aren't met. I'm... I'm thinking about my family. Will I ever see them again? The thought makes me start to cry, and I'm trying so hard to stay quiet...",

    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... The standoff continues for what feels like hours. My whole body aches from being on the floor. I'm so thirsty, but I'm afraid to move or speak. One of the robbers is pacing back and forth, muttering to himself. He seems unstable, and that scares me even more. What if he just starts shooting? I'm imagining worst-case scenarios, and each one is more terrifying than the last...",
    "Therapist: Stay present with what's happening. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: I... I hear more shouting. The police have given the robbers an ultimatum. Things are escalating quickly. There's a crash of breaking glass - I think they've broken a window. People are screaming and scrambling. I'm being pushed and shoved as everyone tries to get away. I can't see clearly, there's so much chaos. My glasses have been knocked off, and everything's a blur...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Terrified. I can't breathe properly. I'm being carried along by the crowd, and I'm scared I'll be trampled. I can hear gunshots, but I don't know who's firing. I'm desperately trying to find an exit, but I'm so disoriented without my glasses. Someone grabs my arm and pulls me towards a door. I don't know if it's friend or foe, but I have no choice but to follow...",

    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm outside now. The bright sunlight is blinding after the dimness of the bank. There are police cars and ambulances everywhere. People are crying, hugging each other. I'm standing there, alone and confused. A paramedic approaches me, asks if I'm hurt. I shake my head, but I can't speak. I'm in shock, I think. They lead me to an ambulance, wrap a blanket around my shoulders. I'm shaking uncontrollably...",
    "Therapist: You've made it through. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Exhausted. But also... relieved? Like I've survived it all over again. My heart is still racing, but it's starting to slow down.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see your desk, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, and the painting behind you.",
