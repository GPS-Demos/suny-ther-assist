    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling anxious about revisiting the memory, but it's manageable right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm back in the hospital room. The beeping of the machines is so loud. I can smell the antiseptic, and it's making me nauseous. My mom is lying in the bed, looking so small and pale. Her hair is gone from the chemo, and her skin looks almost yellow. I'm holding her hand, but it feels cold and limp. I'm trying not to cry, but I can feel the tears welling up.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting more intense. Maybe a 6 out of 10 now. My chest feels tight, and my throat is closing up. I can hear my mom's labored breathing, and it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in, and I can tell by his face that it's not good news. He starts talking about \"options\" and \"quality of life,\" but all I can focus on is the way my mom's hand twitches in mine. I want to scream at him, tell him to do something, anything. But I just sit there, frozen. I feel so helpless, so useless. My mom deserves better than this. She deserves better than me just sitting here, unable to even comfort her properly.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I'm right back in that moment, feeling all that fear and anger and helplessness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's so overwhelming. I can hear my mom trying to say something, but her voice is so weak. I lean in closer, and she whispers, \"It's okay, sweetheart. You can let go.\" And I just... I break down. I'm sobbing, telling her I'm not ready, that I need her. But I can see in her eyes that she's tired, that she's fighting for me, not for herself. And I feel so selfish, so horrible for making her hold on when she's in so much pain.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I'm shaking, and I can feel the tears on my face. My chest hurts so much, like there's a physical weight on it. I can't... I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here. In the office. Not in the hospital. But it still feels so real.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky and upset, but I'm more aware of where I am.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. The next part is... it's hard. I remember the moment she... when she passed. The room went so quiet. The machines stopped beeping, and it was just... silence. I was still holding her hand, and I kept waiting for her to squeeze back, but she didn't. And then the nurses came in, and they were so gentle, but I couldn't bear it. I ran out of the room, down the hall, and I ended up in this little courtyard. I sat on a bench and just... broke down completely.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually coming down. Maybe a 5? I feel sad, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've been carrying this memory for so long, and now I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm not alone with it anymore. Like maybe I can start to process it instead of just trying to avoid it all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Your current SUDS?",
    "Client: I think it's down to a 4 now. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something heavy I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I'm tired, but... I feel like I've accomplished something today.",
    "Therapist: You have. We'll continue next session. Well done."
