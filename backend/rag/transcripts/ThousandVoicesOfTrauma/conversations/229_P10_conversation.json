    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. The thought of revisiting that day... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, maybe 6 AM. I can hear the birds chirping outside. Everything seems normal, peaceful even. I'm getting ready for work, brewing my morning coffee.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. It's... it's subtle at first, but then it gets stronger. My coffee mug falls off the counter and shatters. I... I freeze for a moment, not sure what to do.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. My heart is racing. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The shaking gets more intense. I can hear things falling in my apartment. Picture frames, books... I stumble towards the doorway, trying to stay upright. The noise is deafening - a low, rumbling sound mixed with the crashing of objects.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking this might be it. This might be how I die. I'm alone, and no one knows what's happening to me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My legs feel weak. I'm shaking, but I can't tell if it's me or the earthquake. I... I slide down to the floor, huddled in the doorway. I can smell dust in the air.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right... okay. The shaking continues for what feels like an eternity. I can hear screams from other apartments. Suddenly, there's a loud crack, and part of my ceiling collapses. I... I cover my head with my arms, feeling debris falling on me.",
    "Therapist: What sensations do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel sharp pain as something hits my arm. It's hot and stinging. I'm coughing from the dust. My eyes are watering, and I can taste something metallic... blood, I think.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The shaking finally stops, but I'm... I'm too scared to move. I can hear car alarms going off outside, people shouting. I slowly look up, and my apartment is... it's destroyed. There's a gaping hole in the ceiling, and I can see the sky.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock. I can't believe what I'm seeing. My home, everything I own... it's all in ruins. I feel... lost. Helpless.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here in this room.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I... I slowly stand up. My arm is bleeding, and I wrap it with a torn piece of my shirt. I make my way to the door, stumbling over fallen furniture. When I open it, the hallway is filled with dust and debris. I can hear people crying, calling for help.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start moving down the hallway, checking on my neighbors. Mrs. Lee from next door is struggling to open her jammed door. I help her, and we make our way down the emergency stairs together.",
    "Therapist: How does helping Mrs. Lee make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it gives me a sense of purpose. I'm still terrified, but focusing on helping someone else... it helps me push through my own fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. Continue.",
    "Client: We finally make it outside. The street is... it's chaos. There are people everywhere, some injured, some just looking lost. Buildings are damaged, cars are crushed under fallen debris. I... I can smell smoke in the air.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. It's like a war zone. I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. I'm... I'm scared for what's going to happen next. How will we recover from this?",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right... Thank you. I... I see emergency vehicles arriving. Firefighters, paramedics. They start triaging people. Someone notices my arm and leads me to a makeshift medical station. As I'm getting treated, I... I start to feel the full weight of what's happened.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a mix of things. Relief that I'm alive, guilt for being relatively okay when others are worse off, fear for the future. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to such a traumatic event. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Both in the memory and here, now. It's... it's draining to relive this.",
    "Therapist: Your current distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower now. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: That's good. We're going to start winding down. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breaths* It's... it's strange. Talking about it like this, it's hard, but... I feel like I'm starting to process it differently.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You did very well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but there's a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
