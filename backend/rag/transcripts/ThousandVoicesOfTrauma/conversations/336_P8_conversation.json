    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my mind is still caught in that memory, you know? My heart's racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange, reliving those moments from my time in the cult. I can still hear the leader's voice, see the faces of the other members... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe it's more like... anxiety? It's this constant worry that somehow, they'll find me again. Even though I know logically that I'm safe now, there's this nagging feeling that I'll never truly escape their influence. It's like I'm always looking over my shoulder, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this anxiety manifest in your body?",
    "Client: Well, aside from the racing heart, my palms are sweaty, and I feel this weird tingling sensation in my fingers. It's like my body is ready to run at any moment. And my stomach... it's all knotted up. I guess that's why I've been having trouble eating lately. It's like my body is constantly in fight-or-flight mode.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if I made a mistake by leaving?\" Which is crazy, I know. But there's this part of me that wonders if I'll ever find that sense of belonging again. And then I feel guilty for even considering that, because I know how toxic and manipulative the cult was. It's like my mind is at war with itself.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How do these conflicting thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused, mostly. And angry at myself for not being able to just move on. I mean, it's been three years since I left. Shouldn't I be over this by now? But then I remember the bullying I experienced as a kid, and how that made me vulnerable to the cult's manipulation in the first place. It's like... layers of trauma, you know? And I'm not sure how to peel them all back.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What else comes up for you when you think about these layers?",
    "Client: Sadness, I guess. A deep, aching sadness. For the years I lost, for the relationships that were damaged. And for that scared, lonely kid I used to be who just wanted to belong somewhere. It's like I'm mourning for multiple versions of myself - the one who was bullied, the one who got sucked into the cult, and the one who's struggling to put the pieces back together now.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you coping with these emotions?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not great. I've been throwing myself into work, trying to distract myself. But it's not really helping. Sometimes I have these moments where I feel okay, almost normal. But then something will trigger a memory - a phrase someone uses, or a certain smell - and I'm right back there. It's exhausting, constantly being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What do you think you need to feel more grounded?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to just forget it all happened, you know? But I know that's not realistic or healthy. I think... I think I need to find a way to integrate these experiences into my life without letting them define me. But I don't know how to do that. And I'm scared of what I might uncover if I dig too deep.",
    "Therapist: That's a common fear. How might facing these memories help you move forward?",
    "Client: I suppose... it might help me understand myself better. Maybe if I can make sense of why I was so vulnerable to the cult's influence, I can protect myself from similar situations in the future. And maybe... maybe it would help me be kinder to myself. I've been carrying so much shame and guilt, you know? It's exhausting. If I could see myself as a survivor rather than a victim, maybe that would make a difference.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful perspective. What's one small step you could take in that direction?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start by writing about my experiences. Not to share with anyone, just for myself. To get it all out of my head and onto paper. It might help me see patterns or connections I've missed before. And maybe it would help me process some of these emotions that feel so overwhelming right now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... also a little excited? It's scary to think about confronting all of this, but there's also a part of me that feels ready. Like maybe I'm finally strong enough to face it head-on. And I know I have support now, which makes a big difference. It's not like when I was a kid being bullied, or when I first left the cult and felt so alone. I have people in my corner now, including you. That makes it feel... not easy, exactly, but possible.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that support. What else might help you feel safe as you explore these memories?",
    "Client: I think... maybe establishing some kind of routine or ritual before and after I write. Like, I don't know, maybe lighting a candle or doing some deep breathing exercises. Something to signal to my brain that I'm entering a safe space to process these memories, and then another ritual to help me transition back to the present when I'm done. And maybe setting a time limit, so I don't get too overwhelmed. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How else can we support you in this process?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could check in at the beginning of each session about how the writing is going? And if there's anything that comes up that feels too big to handle on my own, maybe we could work through it together here? I'm realizing that I don't have to do this all alone, and that's... that's a pretty powerful feeling, actually.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic, I think. Still a bit shaky from the exposure exercise, but also like I have a direction to move in. It's like... for the first time in a while, I can see a path forward. It's not going to be easy, but I think I'm ready to take those first steps. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll talk more next week."
