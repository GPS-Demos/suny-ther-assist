    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Rodriguez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the shouting, feel the rough hands on me. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. I've lived in this country for over 50 years, built a life here, and in that moment, none of it mattered. I was just... a target. It's... it's hard to reconcile.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. But... but I also felt something else. A sort of... I don't know, strength maybe? Like I'm finally facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding crowds, especially when I see police around. But going through this... it's making me realize that not all situations are threats. I'm starting to distinguish between then and now.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I... I've been sleeping a little better. The nightmares are less frequent. And yesterday, I actually went to the park with my granddaughter. I was nervous, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic. How do you feel about these changes?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. I'm proud of myself, but also scared. What if I regress? What if it all comes crashing back?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How might you address them?",
    "Client: I suppose... I could keep practicing the breathing exercises you taught me. And maybe... maybe talk to my husband more about how I'm feeling? He's been so supportive.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great strategies. What else might help?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about volunteering at the community center. Maybe helping others could... I don't know, give me a sense of purpose? Help me feel less... victimized?",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful idea. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It's both exciting and terrifying. But I think... I think I'm ready to try. I want to reclaim my life, you know? I'm tired of letting that day define me.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is remarkable. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll call the community center tomorrow. And maybe... maybe take a short walk in the evening. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... but good. I feel like I'm making progress. Slow progress, but still... Thank you for your patience with me, Doctor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: I'd like to... maybe explore more about my feelings of self-worth? The incident... it made me feel so... insignificant. I want to work on that.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable goal. Anything else you'd like to add?",
