    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you're in control. Can you start by describing the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm standing outside this old warehouse. It's dark, and I can hear chanting from inside. My heart is racing. I know I shouldn't go in, but I feel drawn to it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. I'm feeling nervous just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I push open the heavy door. The smell hits me first - incense and sweat. There's a circle of people in robes. They turn to look at me, and I freeze. Their eyes... they seem empty. The leader approaches me, smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. He says, \"We've been waiting for you.\" I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: The leader puts his hand on my shoulder. It feels heavy, like it's pinning me down. He starts talking about how I'm special, how I've been chosen. But all I can think about is how trapped I feel. The circle starts closing in around me. I can feel their body heat, smell their breath. My chest feels so tight...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. God, I feel like I'm actually there again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This memory can't hurt you.",
    "Client: The leader starts chanting, and the others join in. The sound surrounds me, presses in on me. I try to back away, but hands grab my arms. They're not violent, but they're firm. I can't escape. The leader brings out a cup of something... he says it will \"open my mind.\" I don't want to drink it, but they're all staring at me, expecting me to... I...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I take the cup with shaking hands. The liquid inside is dark, almost black. I can smell something herbal, but also something... off. Wrong. The leader is smiling at me, encouraging me. I raise the cup to my lips, feeling like I have no choice. Just as I'm about to drink, there's a loud crash. Police sirens outside. Everything erupts into chaos. People are running, shoving past me. I drop the cup and it shatters. Someone grabs my arm and pulls me towards a back exit. I'm stumbling, disoriented...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel shaky, but also... relieved? Like I narrowly escaped something terrible.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: As I'm being pulled out of the building, I catch a glimpse of the leader's face. He looks furious, but also... scared. For the first time, I see him as just a man, not some all-powerful figure. We burst out into the cool night air, and I gulp it down. My head is spinning, but I feel like I can finally breathe again. The person who grabbed me disappears into the darkness, and I'm left standing alone, watching police cars pull up with flashing lights. I feel... numb. Shocked. But also... free?",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I think... maybe a 5 now? I'm still shaken, but I feel... I don't know, lighter somehow? Like I faced it and survived.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's like... I can look at the memory now without feeling completely overwhelmed by it. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage today."
