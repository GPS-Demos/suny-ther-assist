    "Therapist: Welcome back, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more flashbacks about the cyclone lately, especially at work. It's been making it hard to concentrate.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. Is it... like reliving the trauma? That sounds pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: It involves recounting the experience, yes. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrified. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a common concern. Can I explain why we do this?",
    "Client: Yeah, please. I need to understand why we're doing something that seems so... counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory and reduce its power over time. What are your thoughts?",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense. But how can reliving it possibly make it less powerful? It feels like it would just reinforce how scary it was.",
    "Therapist: By facing it in a safe environment, we can change how your brain processes it.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I get it. But what if I panic? Or can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: A little better, I suppose. But I'm still really nervous. What exactly will we be doing? Can you walk me through it?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll recount the event, and I'll guide you. Ready to try?",
    "Client: I... I think so. But can we stop if it gets too much? I'm worried about losing control.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause anytime. Your bravery is admirable.",
    "Client: Thanks. That helps a bit. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. How do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and start describing the day of the cyclone.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* It was a Tuesday morning. I remember because I had an important meeting at work. The sky was... so dark. Unnaturally dark. The wind was already picking up..."
