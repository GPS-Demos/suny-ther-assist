    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day?",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I'm there. It's early morning, and I'm opening up my shop. The air is still cool, but I know it'll be scorching by midday.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see the familiar shelves of my convenience store. The fluorescent lights flicker as they warm up. There's a faint smell of cardboard and cleaning supplies.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm restocking the refrigerators when I hear the bell above the door. I turn to greet the customer, but... (voice falters) it's not a customer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Can you tell me what you see when you turn around?",
    "Client: There are two men. They're wearing dark clothes and... and masks. One of them has a gun. Oh god, I can see the gun so clearly. It's... it's pointed right at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. My legs feel weak, and I'm thinking about my family. Will I ever see them again? The man with the gun, he's shouting at me to open the register.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's up to about 60. My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm fumbling with the keys. My hands are shaking so badly. The other man, he's grabbing things off the shelves, stuffing them into a bag. The one with the gun, he's getting angry. He's yelling at me to hurry up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay in the moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I finally get the register open. I'm handing over the money, praying they'll just take it and leave. But then... (voice cracks) then we all hear sirens.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're here in a safe place. What happens when you hear the sirens?",
    "Client: Everything happens so fast. The guy with the gun, he grabs me. He's pulling me close, using me as a shield. I can smell his sweat, feel the gun pressed against my temple. The other one is panicking, yelling about what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth. That's it. Now, when you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a shaky breath) The police are outside now. I can hear them on a megaphone, telling the robbers to come out. The guy holding me, he's shouting back, saying he'll shoot me if they come in. I'm... I'm terrified. I'm thinking about my wife, my kids. Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Angry that these men are threatening my life, angry that I might die over the contents of a cash register. But mostly, I'm scared. So scared.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. How long does this standoff last?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but I think it was only about 45 minutes. The whole time, I'm trying to stay still, trying not to provoke them. My legs are shaking, and I'm sweating so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens to end the situation?",
    "Client: The police... they manage to negotiate. The robbers agree to let me go if they're guaranteed safe passage. When they finally release me, my legs almost give out. I stumble towards the police, half-expecting to feel a bullet in my back at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, reliving this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit lightheaded. But... but I'm here. I survived it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You're safe now. Take a few deep breaths. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's around 80, I think. It's hard to shake off those feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the plant in the corner, your desk, the bookshelf, the window, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my shirt, my watch, and the floor beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The leather of the chair and... is that coffee?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. Lastly, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just the lingering taste of the mint I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit better. My heart rate is slowing down. I feel... I feel drained, but also like I've accomplished something.",
    "Therapist: You have accomplished something significant. You faced a traumatic memory and worked through it. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, it's normal for these feelings to linger. We'll work on processing them further. Is there anything else about the experience you want to share?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how close I came to never seeing my family again. It's hard to shake that feeling of vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. We'll continue to work on processing those feelings and developing coping strategies. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll end our session here, but first, let's do a quick relaxation exercise to help you transition. Can you close your eyes and take three deep breaths with me?",
    "Client: Okay. (Takes three deep breaths)",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, imagine a peaceful place. It can be real or imaginary. Where are you?",
    "Client: I'm on a beach. The sun is setting, and the waves are gently lapping at the shore.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Spend a moment there. Feel the warm sand beneath you, hear the waves, smell the salt in the air. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) That... that helped. I feel more centered now.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Remember to use this visualization technique if you feel overwhelmed between sessions. How are you feeling about our work today?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work. We'll continue next session. Take care of yourself this week, and don't hesitate to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you need them.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
