    "Therapist: Welcome back, Rahul. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a little tense just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I see the community center. It's early evening, and I'm walking in for the weekly meeting. The air feels heavy, like something's not right. As I approach the door, I notice unusual silence. Normally, there's chatter, but today it's eerily quiet. My heart starts to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I push open the door, and... oh god. Everyone's there, but they're all sitting in a circle, eyes closed, chanting something I don't recognize. In the center, there's a small fire burning in a metal bowl. The smell of incense is overpowering. I feel dizzy, confused.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Absolute panic. My chest feels tight, and I can't seem to catch my breath. I want to run, but my feet won't move. It's like I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I see my wife... she's part of the circle. Her eyes open, and she looks at me, but it's like she doesn't recognize me. Her pupils are dilated, and there's this eerie smile on her face. I feel sick to my stomach. How could this happen? These were our friends, our community. Now it feels like I've stepped into some twisted nightmare.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding so hard. I feel betrayed, scared, angry. It's all mixed up. The SUDS is still at 9.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. You're handling it well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble backward. I can't process what I'm seeing. As I turn to leave, I bump into someone. It's the group leader. He puts his hand on my shoulder, and I flinch. He says, \"Join us, Rahul. We've seen the truth.\" His voice is so calm, but his eyes... they're not right. I feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's maxed out at 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment. Breathe slowly.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm trying. It's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I push past him and run out. The cool air hits me, and I gasp. I'm shaking all over. I can't believe what I've seen. My wife, my friends... it's like they've been stolen from me. I feel so alone, so betrayed. I get in my car, but I can barely drive. I pull over a few blocks away and just... break down.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The intensity has dropped a bit. Maybe a 7 or 8. I feel drained, but also angry. How could I not have seen this coming?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. What you experienced was shocking.",
    "Client: I know, but... I should have noticed something. The signs must have been there. I feel like I failed them, failed my wife.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts, but not accurate. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel exhausted, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My breathing is steadier now. The tightness in my chest is easing up. I still feel a bit shaky, but it's not as bad.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today. Let's start winding down. Where are you now?",
    "Client: I'm back here, in your office. The memory feels less immediate now. It's still painful, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger for having faced it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 now. I feel drained, but also a sense of relief.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today, Rahul. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it was important. I feel like I understand what happened a bit better now. It still hurts, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. We'll end here for today. Well done."
