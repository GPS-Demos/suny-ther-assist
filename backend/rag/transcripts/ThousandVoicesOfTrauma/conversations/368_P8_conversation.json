    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my heart is racing, but I also feel kind of numb. That memory of being in the hospital during the hostage situation, it's so vivid. I can still hear the beeping of the machines and smell the antiseptic.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, trapped in that hospital bed while everything was chaos around me. I couldn't move, couldn't run... I was just... there.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I notice I'm breathing faster, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like my body is preparing to flee, but there's nowhere to go. I feel trapped all over again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. Why did this have to happen to me?\" And then I feel guilty for thinking that because other people had it worse. Some didn't make it out. But I can't shake this feeling that my life was stolen from me that day. I was just a kid, you know? I should've been worried about classes and crushes, not whether I was going to live or die.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life now?",
    "Client: They... they make everything harder. I struggle to focus in class because I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. I push people away, even my girlfriend, because I'm afraid of losing them. It's like I'm still stuck in that hospital room, even though I'm not.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about sharing this now?",
    "Client: It's... surprisingly relieving? I mean, it's still painful and scary, but talking about it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like, maybe I'm not crazy for feeling this way. But it also makes me sad, realizing how much this experience has affected me.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's complicated. Part of me feels angry that this still has such a hold on me. But another part feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like, if I can understand it better, maybe I can start to move past it. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: What gives you that sense of hope?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That I'm not letting it keep me silent anymore. And, well, the fact that you're listening and not judging me. It makes me feel like maybe I can work through this, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does this hope differ from how you felt before?",
    "Client: Before, it was like I was drowning in this experience. I couldn't see a way out. But now, it's like... maybe there's a lifeline? It's still hard, and I'm still scared, but I feel like maybe I can start to swim instead of just treading water.",
    "Therapist: What would moving forward look like for you?",
    "Client: I think... being able to go to the hospital without having a panic attack would be a start. And maybe being able to watch medical shows again? I used to love those before... you know. And just feeling safer in general, less on edge all the time. Being able to enjoy my relationship and my studies without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about working towards those goals?",
    "Client: It's scary, to be honest. The idea of facing this head-on is terrifying. But... I'm also tired of letting it control my life. I want to be able to live without constantly looking over my shoulder, you know? So yeah, it's scary, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you the courage to face this?",
    "Client: I guess... the realization that I've already survived the worst of it. I made it out of that hospital. If I could do that, maybe I can do this too. And... I don't want to let those people who hurt us win by letting this ruin my life. I want to reclaim my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that determination feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... warm? Like, there's this energy in my chest. It's not exactly comfortable, but it feels... powerful? Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought. My hands aren't shaking as much anymore, and I'm sitting up straighter. It's weird, but I feel more... present?",
    "Therapist: What does this presence mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... maybe I'm not just a victim anymore. Maybe I can be a survivor. It's like, for the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm actually here, in this room, instead of stuck in that memory. And that feels... good. Scary, but good.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this feeling forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to notice when I'm feeling present like this. And when I'm not, maybe I can try to remember this feeling. It's like... a reminder that I'm here, now, and I'm safe. And maybe that can help me face the memories without getting lost in them. Is that... is that something I can work on?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... yeah, I think it is. It feels like something concrete I can do, you know? Like a tool I can use when things get tough. And it's something I can practice, even when I'm not in therapy. It's not going to fix everything overnight, but it feels like a start.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as we wrap up today's session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've run a marathon or something. It was hard, reliving that memory, but I also feel like I understand it a bit better now. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's still scary, but I feel like maybe I can do this. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: What matters is how it feels for you. What's next?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try practicing that presence thing we talked about. Maybe start small, like when I'm feeling anxious in class. And... I think I might try talking to my girlfriend about some of this. Not everything, but... something. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: How does that plan sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Scary, but right. Like I'm taking control back, bit by bit. Thank you for... for helping me get here. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... yeah, I'll see you next week. Thanks again."
