    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. It's all a bit overwhelming. Reliving that workplace bullying incident... it's brought up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The fear, mostly. I could feel my heart racing just like it did back then. I remember the way my supervisor would corner me in the break room, mocking my age and suggesting I should retire. It's like I was right back there, feeling small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... tough. Really tough. But also, different somehow. I noticed I felt angry this time, not just scared. I kept thinking, \"I didn't deserve that treatment.\" Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I suppose it could be. It's the first time I've felt something other than fear when thinking about those incidents. But I'm also exhausted. Reliving it... it's draining. And I worry about how this might affect my current part-time job. What if I start getting anxious there too?",
    "Therapist: How might this experience relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I want to feel more confident in work environments. And maybe recognizing that anger, that sense of injustice, is a step towards standing up for myself? But it's hard. I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories, and now we're diving right into them.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What else?",
    "Client: I... I realized during the exposure that I've been isolating myself a lot since my wife passed. The bullying made me wary of people, and losing her... it just compounded everything. I've been using alcohol to cope more than I'd like to admit. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of avoidance.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's uncomfortable, but... maybe necessary? I think I need to start reaching out more, building connections. Maybe even look into some support groups for widowers or... or for people struggling with substance use. Is that something you think could help?",
    "Therapist: What are your thoughts on that idea?",
    "Client: I think it could be good for me. Scary, but good. It might help me feel less alone in all of this. And maybe talking to others who've gone through similar experiences could give me some new perspectives on how to cope.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How else might this help your recovery?",
    "Client: I suppose... it could help me rebuild my confidence. Both in social situations and in work environments. If I can share my experiences and listen to others, maybe I'll start feeling more... I don't know, worthy? Like I have something to offer. And that might help me feel more secure in my part-time job too.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll look into those support groups we mentioned. And maybe... maybe I'll try to have a coffee with my neighbor next week. Just a small step, you know? And I'll keep working on these exposures, even though they're difficult. I can see now how they might be helping me process everything.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful, I think. It's like I can see a path forward now, even if it's a challenging one. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I need some time to process all of this. But I'm looking forward to our next session. It's... it's nice to feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take care, Mr. Johnson.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I will. See you next week."
