    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doc. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... scared, I guess. It's been a long time since I've really talked about what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our living room. It's evening, and the lights are dim. I can hear the TV in the background, but it's just noise. Maria is... she's standing near the kitchen doorway, and her face is... God, she looks terrified.",
    "Therapist: Good, Carlos. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm yelling. My fists are clenched, and I can feel this... this rage building up inside me. It's like I'm back in the war, you know? Everything feels like a threat.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's... it's getting intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I take a step towards her. She flinches, and it... it makes me even angrier. I'm shouting about... about how she doesn't understand, how no one understands what I've been through. My heart is racing, and I can feel sweat on my forehead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My hands are... they're shaking. I feel hot, like I'm about to explode.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I pick up a vase from the coffee table. Maria's eyes go wide, and she's begging me to calm down. But I... I can't hear her. All I can hear is the sound of gunfire in my head. I... oh God, I throw the vase. It shatters against the wall, inches from her head.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening for you right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My throat feels tight. I can't... I can't believe I did that. I almost... I could have hurt her so badly.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Carlos. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still in the room. Maria is crying now. She's slid down to the floor, and she's... she's looking at me like I'm a monster. And maybe I am.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. This is... it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here now, safe in this room. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I suddenly realize what I've done. The rage just... it drains out of me. I feel... empty. Horrified. I take a step towards Maria, but she flinches again, and I... I can't bear it. I turn and I run out of the house.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go?",
    "Client: I... I get in my truck. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely get the key in the ignition. I just... I drive. I don't know where I'm going. I just know I can't face what I've done.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment in the memory?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel so ashamed. So scared. What if I've ruined everything? What if I've become the very thing I fought against?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. Maybe even higher. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Take another deep breath. Where does the truck take you?",
    "Client: I... I end up at the beach. It's dark now, and the waves... they're loud. Angry. Like me. I get out of the truck and I just... I collapse on the sand. I'm crying. I can't remember the last time I cried like this.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you sit there?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about Maria. About how scared she looked. About all the times I've lost control. I'm thinking about my time in the war, about the things I saw, the things I did. I'm wondering if I'll ever be... normal again.",
    "Therapist: And how does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. My muscles are aching. My head is pounding. I feel like I could sleep for days, but I'm also... wired. Alert. Like danger could come at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's good, Carlos. You're processing this. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I sit there for hours. The sun starts to come up. I watch it rise over the water, and I... I make a decision. I need help. I can't keep living like this. I can't keep putting Maria through this.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel making that decision?",
    "Client: I feel... scared. But also... relieved? Like maybe there's hope. Like maybe I'm not completely lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I drive home. My hands are steady now. When I get there, Maria is... she's sitting on the couch. She looks like she hasn't slept. When she sees me, she starts to cry again, but... but she lets me hold her. I tell her I'm sorry. That I'm going to get help.",
    "Therapist: And how does that moment feel?",
    "Client: It feels... raw. Painful. But also... like a beginning. Like maybe we can heal from this.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now, Carlos?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50. I feel... drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Carlos. How are you feeling now, back in the present?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe proud? Like I faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you did. You showed incredible courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you, doc. I... I never thought I could talk about this without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you give yourself credit for, Carlos. How about we take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I could use a moment to... to come back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's start by focusing on your breath..."
