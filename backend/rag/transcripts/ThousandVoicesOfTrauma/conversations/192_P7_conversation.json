    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit your experience as a refugee?",
    "Client: I think so. It's still hard to talk about, but I'll try.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, it was about three years ago. We were in our village when we heard the first explosions. The sound was deafening, and I could feel the ground shake beneath my feet. My partner and I looked at each other, and without saying a word, we knew we had to leave immediately. We grabbed what we could - some clothes, a few photos, and whatever food was in the pantry. As we were rushing out, I remember the overwhelming smell of smoke and burning...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We ran towards the outskirts of the village, and I could hear screaming and crying all around us. Children were calling for their parents, and there was so much confusion. I saw our neighbor, an elderly woman, struggling to walk. I wanted to help her, but there was no time. That image still haunts me... leaving her behind.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: We made it to the main road, and it was chaos. Cars were speeding by, people were running with whatever they could carry. I remember the dust in the air, making it hard to breathe. We managed to flag down a truck that was heading towards the border. As we climbed in, I looked back at our village one last time. The sky was filled with smoke, and I could see flames in the distance. It was like watching our whole life burn away.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The journey to the border was long and uncomfortable. We were crammed in the back of the truck with so many others. People were crying, praying, some were just silent with shock. I held onto my partner's hand so tightly, afraid we might get separated in the chaos. The heat was unbearable, and we had very little water. I remember feeling so thirsty and dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: When we finally reached the border, it was like entering another world of chaos. There were thousands of people trying to cross, and the guards seemed overwhelmed. We waited for hours in the scorching sun, not knowing if we'd be allowed through. I saw families being separated, children crying for their parents. It was heartbreaking. When it was finally our turn, I was terrified they'd turn us away. The guard looked at our papers for what felt like an eternity. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: We were finally allowed through, but the relief was short-lived. We had no idea where to go or what to do next. We ended up in a refugee camp, and that's where we stayed for months. The conditions were... difficult. Cramped, unsanitary, with barely enough food to go around. I felt so helpless, so far from home. At night, I'd lie awake, listening to the sounds of people crying, children coughing. I missed our home, our life, everything we left behind.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You've been through so much.",
    "Client: The hardest part was not knowing what would happen next. Every day was filled with uncertainty. Would we ever go back home? Would we be sent to another country? The waiting was excruciating. I tried to stay strong for my partner, but inside, I was falling apart. I felt guilty for surviving when so many others didn't make it. And the nightmares... they were relentless. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I was back in the village during the attack.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, we were granted asylum in this country. I should have felt relieved, but I was overwhelmed with a new kind of fear. How would we start over? How would we learn a new language, find work, make a life here? It felt like we were leaving everything behind all over again. The day we left the camp, I felt a mix of hope and dread. As we boarded the plane, I looked back one last time, thinking of all the people we were leaving behind, still waiting for their chance at a new life.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. Talking about it brings back so many emotions. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and sharing it helps somehow. But it's still hard. I worry about the people we left behind, and I still struggle with guilt sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. You've been incredibly brave today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know we've made progress here, but sometimes it feels like I'll never fully move past this experience. It's shaped so much of who I am now.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I just need to be patient with myself. It's just... some days are harder than others. Especially when something reminds me of home or the people we lost. But I'm trying to focus on building a life here, on the opportunities we have now. It's not easy, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's all we can ask. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need some time to process all of this. It's been a lot to revisit these memories. But I'm glad we did this session. It helps to talk about it, even if it's painful.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here."
