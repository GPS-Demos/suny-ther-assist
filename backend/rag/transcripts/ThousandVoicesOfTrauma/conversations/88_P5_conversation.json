    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about the bullying, and it's bringing up a lot of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. Can you explain what exactly that means? I'm not sure I fully grasp the concept.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. Shall I elaborate?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm feeling a bit apprehensive about revisiting those memories. They're still quite painful.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. This process helps reduce their emotional impact over time. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It makes sense, but it's scary. Will it make the nightmares worse? I'm already struggling with sleep.",
    "Therapist: It may initially increase discomfort, but ultimately aims to reduce symptoms. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I'm conflicted. I want to get better, but the idea of deliberately thinking about the bullying is daunting. How exactly will this help?",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory repeatedly, it loses its power. Your brain reprocesses it. Does this clarify things?",
    "Client: A little. So, it's like exposure therapy but for memories? That's interesting. What will I need to do exactly?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying. But I trust you, Dr. Thompson. Will you be there to support me if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. You're in control. What other concerns do you have?",
    "Client: I'm worried about breaking down or not being able to continue. What if I can't handle it? And... I'm embarrassed about some of the details of what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We can pause anytime. There's no judgment here. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we have a safe word or signal if I need to stop? And perhaps some grounding exercises before we start? I've found those helpful in the past.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. We'll implement both. You're showing great courage. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. How long will this process take? Will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for several sessions, adjusting as needed. Shall we set up our signal now?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do that. And maybe we could spend a few minutes on some deep breathing before we start? I'm feeling quite anxious now that it's becoming real.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin with grounding. Focus on your breath. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's helping a bit. My heart's still racing, but I feel more centered. Thank you for being so patient with me, Dr. Thompson. I know this is important for my recovery.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. Ready to continue?",
