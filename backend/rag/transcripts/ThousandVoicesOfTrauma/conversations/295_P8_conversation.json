    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel a tightness in my chest. It's like I was right back there, in the middle of the flood. The sound of the water rushing, the panic in everyone's voices... it all felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt, I think. I keep thinking about my neighbor's little girl who got swept away. I... I couldn't save her. I can still hear her mother's screams. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do those feelings show up in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. And I feel this heaviness in my stomach, like a rock sitting there. My throat feels tight too, like I'm trying not to cry. It's strange, but I also feel cold, even though the room isn't chilly. It's like my body is remembering the flood waters.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do more?\" I know logically that I couldn't have... the current was too strong. But part of me still feels like I failed. And then I think about how lucky I was to survive when others didn't. It makes me feel guilty for being alive, for being here in therapy trying to get better when so many others lost everything.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your experiences with domestic violence?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it before, but there's a similar feeling of helplessness. With the flood, I couldn't control nature. In my marriage, I couldn't control my ex-husband's anger. In both situations, I felt powerless, trapped. And in both, I carry this guilt for not being able to change things, for not being able to protect others or myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's eye-opening, actually. I've always kept these experiences separate in my mind, but they do share that common thread of powerlessness. And in both cases, I've blamed myself for things that were out of my control. It's like I'm carrying the weight of two different disasters on my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that connection make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's some relief, oddly enough. Like, maybe I've been too hard on myself all this time. But there's also sadness. A deep, aching sadness for all that's been lost, in both situations. And a bit of anger too, I think. Anger at the circumstances, at my ex-husband, even at nature itself. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to breathe. Just sit with these feelings for a bit. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself. It's hard, but I'm starting to see that not everything was my fault. I couldn't control the flood any more than I could control my ex-husband's actions. That's... that's a big realization for me.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight impact your healing journey?",
    "Client: I think it could be really significant. If I can start to let go of some of this guilt and self-blame, maybe I can focus more on healing and moving forward. It's scary to think about, but also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a way to honor what happened, remember those we lost, without carrying all this weight. I don't know if I'm ready to do that yet, but for the first time, I can see that it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards self-compassion?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could start by acknowledging one thing each day that wasn't my fault. Whether it's related to the flood, my marriage, or just daily life. It sounds simple, but I think it would be challenging for me. I'm so used to taking on responsibility for everything. But it might help me start to shift my perspective.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... uncomfortable, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I'm stretching a muscle I haven't used in a long time. There's a part of me that's resistant, that wants to hold onto the guilt because it's familiar. But there's another part that feels a glimmer of hope. Maybe by doing this, I can start to forgive myself, little by little.",
    "Therapist: What support might you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I think... I might need reminders. It's easy to fall back into old patterns of thinking. Maybe I could set a daily alarm on my phone, or leave myself notes. And... I might need patience from my family. They've been so supportive, but I know my healing journey affects them too. I want to be able to talk to them about this new perspective I'm trying to develop.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've done some hard but necessary work. I didn't expect to make these connections between the flood and my marriage, but now that I have, it feels significant. I'm nervous about trying to change my thinking patterns, but I also feel a spark of determination. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to implement this self-compassion practice. And maybe delve deeper into how my experiences with the flood and my marriage have shaped my relationships with my family. They've been so supportive, but I know my trauma has affected them too. I want to find ways to heal not just myself, but our family unit as a whole.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaky from the exposure exercise, but also like I've gained some new understanding. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and hope. I'm looking forward to going home and reflecting on what we've discussed today. It feels like a small step, but an important one on this long journey of healing.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness today. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
