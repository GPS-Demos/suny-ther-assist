    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment in the hospital, when the doctor told me about the complications... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so visceral, you know? I could feel my heart racing, just like it did that day. And the helplessness... I felt so powerless, like my body was betraying me. It's strange how vivid it all still is, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I didn't expect it to hit me so hard. I've always prided myself on being strong, on having everything under control. But reliving that moment... it's like I'm right back there, feeling so vulnerable and scared. I... I'm not used to feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident in facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... it's hard to reconcile this with who I am now. I'm a successful professional, I have a good life with my husband. But this experience... it's like it's still lurking beneath the surface, ready to pull me back.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I've been so anxious lately. Why I've been having trouble sleeping, why I get so tense when anyone mentions hospitals or medical procedures. It's like my body is constantly on high alert, waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How else has it affected you?",
    "Client: I've been pushing people away, I realize that now. My husband, he's been so patient, but I know he doesn't understand why I get so irritable sometimes. And at work, I've been taking on more and more, as if I'm trying to prove that I'm in control of everything. But I'm not, am I? No one is.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you make of it?",
    "Client: I think... I think I've been running from this for a long time. Trying to outwork it, out-achieve it. But it's always been there, hasn't it? This fear, this trauma. Maybe... maybe it's time I stopped running and actually faced it.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Scared. Really scared. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe if I can face this, I can start to let go of some of this tension I've been carrying around. Maybe I can sleep better, be more present with my husband. It's just... it's going to be hard.",
    "Therapist: It is challenging, but you're showing remarkable strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that. It helps to hear it, you know? Because sometimes I feel anything but strong. Especially when we do these exercises. But I'm starting to see that maybe facing this head-on is its own kind of strength.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how this has affected my relationships. Especially with my husband. I've been keeping him at arm's length, and that's not fair to him. Maybe if I can understand this better, I can start to let him in more.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. I'd like to... to try to be kinder to myself through this process. I realize I've been pretty hard on myself for having these reactions. But they're normal, aren't they? After what I went through?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Self-compassion is crucial in this process.",
    "Client: Right. So that's what I want to work on. Being kinder to myself, and opening up more to my husband. And... and continuing to face these memories, as hard as it is. Because I think I'm starting to see that it's the only way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a weight I didn't even know I was carrying. It's exhausting, but I think... I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your insight and courage are commendable. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see why it's important. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."
