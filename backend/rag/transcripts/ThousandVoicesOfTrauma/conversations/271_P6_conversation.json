    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know this is important for my healing process.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory we discussed last session.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm back in the refugee camp. It's hot, dusty. I can smell sweat and unwashed bodies. The tents stretch as far as I can see. I'm standing in line for water, and I can hear children crying nearby.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: There's this man... he's shouting at everyone. His face is red with anger. He's telling us we're worthless, that we don't deserve to be here. I feel so small, so helpless. My hands are shaking, and I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. I can feel the fear creeping in, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going with the memory.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He's getting closer to me in the line. I want to run, but I can't move. My throat feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe. He's right in front of me now, screaming in my face. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. I feel so ashamed, so worthless...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm frozen in place. He's grabbing my arm, shaking me. I can hear others whimpering around me. I feel so powerless, so... insignificant. Like I don't even have the right to exist.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel dizzy, nauseous. The shame is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. It's so intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) He's let go of me, but I can still feel where his fingers dug into my arm. I'm trembling all over. I want to disappear, to sink into the ground. The other people in line are avoiding eye contact. No one's helping. I feel so alone, so abandoned.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8? I can feel myself here in the room again, even though the memory is still vivid.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you remember.",
    "Client: I'm stumbling away from the water line. My legs feel weak. I make it back to our tent, and I collapse inside. I'm sobbing, but trying to stay quiet so no one hears me. I feel so humiliated, so broken. Like I'll never be whole again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: The intensity is fading. I'm still shaky, but I can feel myself grounding in the present. My SUDS is probably around a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: (sighs) Okay. I'm lying in the tent, curled up in a ball. I can hear life going on outside, but I feel disconnected from it all. I'm replaying his words in my head, believing them. Feeling like maybe he's right, maybe I am worthless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling sad, but the panic has subsided.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) Thank you. That was... intense. But I feel like I faced something important.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm drained, but also... lighter somehow. My SUDS is back down to about a 3. I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength today. We'll process this next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm proud of myself for getting through it.",
    "Therapist: You should be. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself."
