    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the school hallway. It's crowded, and I can hear lockers slamming shut. I see Sarah and her friends approaching. My heart starts racing, and I feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Sarah starts laughing and pointing at me. She says, \"Look at the freak!\" Her friends join in, calling me names. I feel so small, like I want to disappear. My cheeks are burning with embarrassment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're stronger now.",
    "Client: Okay... Sarah pushes me against the lockers. The metal feels cold on my back. I can smell her perfume, it's sickly sweet. She leans in close and whispers, \"Nobody likes you. Why don't you just leave?\"",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I feel tears welling up in my eyes. I want to run, but my legs won't move. A teacher walks by, but he doesn't notice what's happening. I feel so alone, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Sarah grabs my backpack and dumps its contents on the floor. Everyone's laughing. I drop to my knees to pick up my things, and Sarah kicks my books away. I feel so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is pounding. It feels so real, like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: I remember wishing I could just disappear. I felt so worthless, like maybe Sarah was right. Maybe nobody did like me. I... I started to believe her words.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The bell rings, and Sarah and her friends leave, still laughing. I'm left there, kneeling on the floor, surrounded by my scattered belongings. Other students step over my things, not even looking at me. I feel invisible and broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: I slowly gather my things, my hands trembling. I'm late for class now, which makes me even more anxious. I can still hear Sarah's words echoing in my head. I walk into the classroom, and everyone stares at me. The teacher looks annoyed. I sink into my seat, wishing I could just vanish.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it then, and I can face it now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. I've never talked about it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I feel exhausted, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to use your coping strategies. We'll discuss this more next time."
