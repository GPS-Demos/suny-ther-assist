    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. When you're ready, start describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my room, scrolling through my phone. It's late at night, and I can't sleep. I'm reading comments on a post I made earlier. My heart starts racing as I see notification after notification pop up. They're all so mean...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but not too bad yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The comments keep coming. They're calling me ugly, worthless... saying I should kill myself. My hands are shaking, and I feel sick to my stomach. I want to throw my phone across the room, but I can't stop reading.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: That sounds distressing. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see a message from someone I thought was my friend. They've joined in, saying I deserve all the hate. I feel so betrayed, so alone. Tears are streaming down my face, and I can't stop them. I'm curling up into a ball on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel overwhelmed, like I'm drowning in all these hateful words.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're safe here. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I can't stop thinking about how everyone hates me. My mind is racing with thoughts of worthlessness. I'm remembering all the awful things I saw in combat, and now it feels like the whole world is against me too. I'm shaking uncontrollably, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start having flashbacks to the war. The cyberbullying comments blend with the sounds of gunfire and explosions. I'm completely disoriented, not sure what's real anymore. My whole body is tense, and I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't take it anymore. I want to run away, to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Stay with the memory. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to put the phone down. I'm sobbing uncontrollably, gasping for air. I stumble to the bathroom and splash cold water on my face. I look in the mirror and barely recognize myself. I'm so pale, and my eyes are red and puffy.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8? I'm still shaky, but the cold water helped ground me a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I curl up on the bathroom floor, trying to calm myself down. I start doing those breathing exercises we've practiced. In for four, hold for four, out for four. It takes a while, but eventually, my heart rate starts to slow down.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm still upset, but I'm starting to feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: I make my way back to bed, leaving my phone in the bathroom. I wrap myself in a blanket, feeling drained but a little safer. I keep focusing on my breathing, trying to push the hateful comments out of my mind.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as we end this exercise?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's down to a 4 now. I feel exhausted, but the intense panic has subsided.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It was hard to go through that again, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it once, and I can survive remembering it too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done today."
