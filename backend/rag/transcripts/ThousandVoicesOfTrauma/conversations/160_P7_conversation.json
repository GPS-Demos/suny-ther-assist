    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the medical trauma you experienced during your military service?",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It was during my deployment in Vietnam. We were on a routine patrol when suddenly... [takes a deep breath] We were ambushed. The sounds of gunfire were deafening. I saw my buddy, Jim, get hit. There was so much blood...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I rushed to Jim's side. His leg was badly injured, and I knew I had to act fast. My hands were shaking as I tried to apply a tourniquet. The smell of blood and gunpowder was overwhelming. I kept thinking, \"I can't let him die. I can't let him die.\"",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to stop the bleeding, but Jim was in so much pain. He was crying out, and I felt so helpless. We had to wait for the medevac, and it felt like an eternity. The whole time, I was terrified that the enemy would find us.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How were you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I was scared out of my mind. My heart was racing, and I couldn't stop sweating. But I knew I had to stay focused for Jim's sake. I kept talking to him, trying to keep him conscious. I remember feeling angry too - angry at the situation, angry that I couldn't do more.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: When the medevac finally arrived, I felt a rush of relief. But as they were loading Jim onto the helicopter, I suddenly felt overwhelmed. The realization hit me that this could have been me. I could have died out there. [voice trembles]",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: [breathes deeply] After they took Jim away, I had to continue with the mission. But I couldn't shake the image of him lying there, covered in blood. For weeks after, I had nightmares about it. I kept reliving that moment, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The guilt was... is... overwhelming. Jim survived, but he lost his leg. Every time I see him now, I'm reminded of that day. I feel responsible somehow, even though I know logically that I did everything I could.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How do you feel now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's hard. My heart is racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. But... it's also somewhat relieving to talk about it. I've kept this bottled up for so long. I never wanted to burden my family with these memories.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Let's stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I think what haunts me most is the smell. Even now, certain smells can trigger these memories. The metallic scent of blood, the acrid smell of gunpowder... Sometimes, I'll catch a whiff of something similar, and suddenly, I'm right back there in that jungle.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: It's affected my life in so many ways. I became hyper-vigilant after returning home. Loud noises would make me jump. I struggled to sleep, always feeling like I needed to be on guard. It put a strain on my relationships, especially with my late wife. She tried to understand, but how could she? She wasn't there.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those difficulties. Keep going.",
    "Client: Over the years, I've learned to cope better. But there are still moments when it all comes flooding back. Fireworks on the 4th of July, the sight of someone in uniform, even certain scenes in movies... they can all trigger these memories. I've often wondered if I'll ever truly be free from that day.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also somewhat lighter. Talking about it like this, it's hard, but it's also helping me face it. I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories, but maybe that's not the answer. Maybe I need to confront them to truly move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful. Like maybe I can learn to live with these memories without letting them control me. It's scary, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: [takes a deep breath] Okay. I'm feeling a bit shaky, but I think I'm alright. This was intense, but I'm glad we did it. I know it's just the beginning, but I already feel like I'm making progress. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to sit quietly for a moment if that's okay. Just to collect my thoughts and calm down a bit. Then maybe we could talk about some coping strategies for the rest of the week? I know these memories might be more vivid for a while after this session.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Take all the time you need."
