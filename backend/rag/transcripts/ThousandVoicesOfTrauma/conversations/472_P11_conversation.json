    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always hard to go back there, you know? Reliving that moment when the guards slammed the cell door shut... it's like I can still hear the echo. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The smell. I hadn't remembered that before, but today it hit me. That musty, damp smell of the cell. It's like... it's like it was filling my lungs again. And the feeling of helplessness, of being trapped. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react as you recalled those sensations?",
    "Client: My hands got clammy, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like... like I couldn't breathe properly. I noticed I was clenching my jaw too. It's funny how our bodies remember things our minds try to forget, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I sometimes get that same tightness in my chest when I'm in small spaces, like elevators. And that feeling of helplessness... it creeps up on me when I'm faced with situations I can't control. It's like I'm back in that cell, powerless.",
    "Therapist: I see. What strategies helped you get through the exposure today?",
    "Client: I tried to focus on my breathing, like we practiced. And I kept reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It helped a little, but it's still so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But... I want to get better. I want to be able to live my life without these memories controlling me. So, I'm willing to keep going. It's just... sometimes I wonder if it'll ever get easier.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: I guess... the small changes I've noticed. Like, I can talk about it now without completely falling apart. And my family has noticed I'm less jumpy. It's not much, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might we build on these gains?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on more coping strategies for when I feel trapped? And I think I need to practice more self-compassion. I'm so hard on myself sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we focus on those next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm not alone in it anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and relief.",
    "Therapist: That's common after these sessions. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for understanding. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. See you next time."
