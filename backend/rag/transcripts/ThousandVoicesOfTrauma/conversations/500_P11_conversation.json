    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting those memories of being bullied. The connection to police brutality we discussed... it brought up a lot of emotions I wasn't expecting.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: Well, the feeling of powerlessness. When I was bullied in school, I felt so helpless. And now, seeing stories of police brutality on the news, it's like... it's bringing back those same feelings. I keep thinking about how those victims must feel, and it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did your body react during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like I was back there, you know? I could almost feel the physical pain from when they would push me around. And then, when we shifted to talking about police brutality, I felt this... this anger building up. It's like all those years of feeling helpless just came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I've been so on edge lately. Every time I see a police officer, or even just someone in authority, I get this surge of anxiety. It's like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen. I've been avoiding watching the news because I'm afraid of what I might see. It's affecting my work, my relationships... I feel like I'm always on guard.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What did you learn from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I guess I realized how much those past experiences are still affecting me. I always thought I had moved on from the bullying, but now I see how it's shaped my view of the world. And this connection to police brutality... it's like it's given those old fears new life. But at the same time, I felt... I felt stronger going through the memory this time. Like maybe I'm not as helpless as I used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to work on feeling more in control. Maybe I could look into ways to advocate for anti-bullying programs or police reform. It might help me feel less powerless. And I want to work on not letting these fears control my life so much. Maybe... maybe I could try watching the news in small doses, instead of avoiding it completely?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling about continuing our work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready. This session was hard, but I feel like I understand myself better now. And I want to keep working on this. I want to be able to live my life without constantly feeling afraid or angry. It's not going to be easy, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think... I think I'm starting to see a light at the end of this tunnel. It's faint, but it's there. And I want to keep moving towards it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's set that up and continue this important work."
