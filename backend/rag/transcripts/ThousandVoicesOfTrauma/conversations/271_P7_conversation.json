    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the refugee experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about seven years ago. We were fleeing our home country due to political unrest. We had to leave everything behind. I remember the night we left... it was so dark and quiet. We were terrified of being caught.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: We were in a cramped van with several other families. The air was thick with fear and uncertainty. I could hear my partner's rapid breathing next to me. Our hands were tightly clasped, sweaty from anxiety. The children were unusually quiet, sensing the tension.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell... it was a mix of sweat and diesel fumes. My stomach was in knots. I kept thinking about our home, our life, everything we were leaving behind. Would we ever see our families again? The weight of that uncertainty was crushing.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: As we approached the border, my heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. The driver told us to stay absolutely silent. I remember holding my breath, afraid even the slightest sound would give us away. The border guards were known to be ruthless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: We waited for what felt like hours as other vehicles were checked. When it was finally our turn, I thought I might pass out from fear. The guard approached our van, his flashlight beam sweeping over us. I can still see his cold, suspicious eyes. He barked questions at the driver, and I prayed he wouldn't ask to see our nonexistent papers.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: My whole body was tense, muscles clenched so tight they ached. My mouth was dry, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. The children started to whimper, and I was terrified their cries would give us away. I wanted to comfort them, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Somehow, miraculously, the guard waved us through. As we drove away, I felt a rush of relief so intense it made me dizzy. But it was short-lived. We still had a long, dangerous journey ahead, and the guilt of leaving others behind was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to revisit those memories. I feel a mix of gratitude for our escape and deep sadness for those we left behind. There's also anger at the circumstances that forced us to flee. And shame... shame that we couldn't do more to help others.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You've come so far.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult to talk about, but I know it's important. Sometimes I still have nightmares about that night, about what could have happened if we'd been caught. The fear of being sent back still lingers, even though we're safe now.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *Takes a deep breath* It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I realize now how much that experience has shaped me. It's made me more appreciative of what we have now, but also more anxious about the future. I worry constantly about my family's safety, even in our new home.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've shown remarkable resilience.",
    "Client: I suppose I have. It's just... sometimes I feel guilty for being happy here when I know others are still suffering. And I struggle with my identity now. I'm caught between two worlds, not fully belonging to either. It's a constant internal conflict.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How are you coping now?",
    "Client: I try to focus on building a new life here, on giving our children the opportunities we never had. But it's hard. The emotional scars run deep. Some days are better than others. I'm grateful for this therapy, for having a safe space to process these experiences.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel a bit lighter having shared this. Thank you for listening and for guiding me through these difficult memories. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next week."
