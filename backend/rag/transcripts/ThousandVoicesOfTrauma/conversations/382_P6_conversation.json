    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I suppose so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. But I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in my old house. I can see my ex-partner standing there, looking angry. Her face is red, and she's shouting at me. I feel... I feel small, like I'm shrinking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 5, I'd say. My hands are getting clammy.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: She's getting closer now, her voice getting louder. I can smell the alcohol on her breath. My heart is starting to race. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. I can hear the neighbors' TV through the wall, and it makes me feel even more trapped.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: She's right in my face now, screaming about how useless I am. I can feel spit hitting my cheek as she yells. My legs are shaking. I'm trying to speak, to defend myself, but no words come out. I feel so helpless, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) She's raising her hand now. I flinch, expecting the blow. But instead, she grabs my shirt, pulling me close. Her nails dig into my skin through the fabric. I can see the veins in her neck bulging as she screams. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My whole body is tense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I finally manage to push her away. She stumbles back, shocked. For a moment, there's silence. Then she starts crying. I feel... confused. Guilty. But also relieved. My heart is still pounding, but the immediate fear is fading.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's dropped to about a 6. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. It's strange, reliving it like this. It's intense, but... I feel like I'm starting to process it differently.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, John."
