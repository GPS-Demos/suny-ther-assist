    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around 60? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day in the hospital...",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. It's so bright, and the smell of disinfectant is overwhelming. I'm here for a routine check-up, but something feels off. There's tension in the air.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are other patients waiting. An old man with a cane, a pregnant woman... Oh God, there's a guy who keeps pacing. He looks agitated. My heart's starting to race.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The pacing man suddenly pulls out a gun. He's yelling something about needing drugs. Everyone starts screaming. I... I can't move. I'm frozen in my chair.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man is waving the gun around. He's demanding that the receptionist lock the doors. I can hear sirens in the distance. Oh God, we're trapped in here with him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: He's... he's herding us into a corner. The pregnant woman is crying. I can smell her perfume mixed with the hospital smell. It's making me nauseous. The gunman keeps shouting about needing painkillers. His eyes are wild, bloodshot.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard. I can barely breathe. My legs feel weak, like they might give out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in my office. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The police are outside now. I can hear them on a megaphone. The gunman is getting more agitated. He's... he's grabbing the old man with the cane, using him as a shield. The old man looks so frail, I'm terrified he's going to hurt him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours are passing. We're all huddled together. I can hear people whimpering. The air feels thick, hard to breathe. My legs are cramping from sitting on the floor. The gunman is sweating profusely, his hands shaking. I'm so thirsty, but I'm afraid to ask for water.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The police have breached the door. Everything happens so fast. There's shouting, a gunshot. I'm on the ground, covering my head. I can taste the dust from the floor. Then... silence.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I slowly look up. The gunman is on the ground, handcuffed. Police are everywhere. Someone's helping me up, asking if I'm okay. But I can't speak. I'm just... numb.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. My SUDS is still around 85. It felt so real.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Sarah. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, my water bottle, and... and your pen.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my hair, and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The clock ticking, traffic outside, and the air conditioning.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Your coffee and... maybe lavender? Is that an air freshener?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit better. My heart's not racing as much. Maybe... SUDS of 60?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's talk about what you experienced during the exposure.",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt like I was right back there. The fear, the helplessness... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What was the most challenging part for you?",
    "Client: Probably when he grabbed the old man. I felt so guilty that I couldn't do anything to help.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling in situations like this. Remember, you weren't responsible for the gunman's actions.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How do you feel now, compared to before we started?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit proud? I didn't think I could do it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You faced a very difficult memory. What did you learn from this experience?",
    "Client: I guess... that I can face this. It's hard, but I can do it. And maybe... maybe it doesn't have as much power over me as I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight, Sarah. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: Could we maybe do some more grounding? I'm feeling a bit shaky still.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's try a progressive muscle relaxation exercise...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Sarah?",
    "Client: Much calmer. My SUDS is down to about 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel distressed later. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. You did excellent work today. We'll continue to process this in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
