    "Therapist: Mrs. Patel, today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Oh, I'm not sure, Dr. Sharma. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that horrible night... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. It's a crucial step in healing. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried I might fall apart completely. What if I can't handle it? I've spent so long trying to forget that night, and now you want me to remember every detail? It feels counterintuitive, and frankly, quite frightening.",
    "Therapist: Your fears are valid. We'll go at your pace. How about we discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like watching a movie of that night? Or more like telling a story? And how long will it last? I'm not sure I can talk about it for too long without getting overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: It's more like telling your story. We'll start with 20 minutes. What else would you like to know?",
    "Client: Twenty minutes sounds like an eternity when it comes to this topic. Will you be guiding me through it? Or am I supposed to just... start talking? And what happens if I freeze up or start crying? I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I'm afraid I might lose control.",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you gently. Pausing or crying is normal. We can stop anytime. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Sharma. I know I must seem like a difficult patient, always questioning everything. It's just that at my age, I never thought I'd be dealing with something like this. I always prided myself on being strong and independent.",
    "Therapist: You're not difficult. Your questions show courage. This process takes strength. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I suppose I'm wondering... will this actually help? I mean, I've been having nightmares and feeling jumpy for months now. How will talking about it make those symptoms go away? It seems like it might make things worse before they get better.",
    "Therapist: Great question. Exposure often reduces symptoms over time. It helps process the memory. Shall we discuss the science behind it?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. I've always been one for understanding the 'why' behind things. It might help me feel more in control if I understand the process better. And... I have to admit, I'm curious about how something that seems so counterintuitive could actually help.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Exposure helps your brain process trauma memories, reducing their power. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Absolutely. I'm all ears, Dr. Sharma. If understanding this can help me feel less afraid of the process, I'm willing to listen. And who knows? Maybe it'll give me the courage I need to face this head-on. I may be retired, but I still love learning new things.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful attitude. Let's dive in. Any specific aspects you're curious about?",
    "Client: Well, I'm particularly interested in how this might affect my sleep. The nightmares have been the worst part of all this. Will talking about the event in detail make them more vivid? Or is the goal to make them less frequent? And how long does it usually take before people start seeing improvements?",
    "Therapist: Great questions. Nightmares may initially intensify but often decrease with time. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could certainly use some strategies. These sleepless nights are taking a toll on me. My flatmate has been so patient, but I know my tossing and turning disturbs her too. If there's anything I can do to manage this better, I'm all for it.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let's explore relaxation techniques and sleep hygiene. Ready to try some now?",
    "Client: I'm ready. You know, Dr. Sharma, I'm feeling a bit more optimistic now. It helps to know there's a method to all this, even if it seems scary at first. I just hope I can muster up the strength to go through with it when the time comes.",
    "Therapist: Your optimism is encouraging. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your patience and for explaining everything so clearly. It means a lot to have someone who understands guiding me through this. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Let's start slowly. Remember, you're in control."
