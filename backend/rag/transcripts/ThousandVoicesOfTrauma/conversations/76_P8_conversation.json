    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I can still hear the screeching tires and smell the burning rubber. It's so vivid, you know? I keep seeing flashes of the accident, the way the other car just came out of nowhere. I feel... I feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, like I'm still in danger somehow. It's silly, I know I'm safe here, but... it doesn't feel that way.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had left the house just a minute later? Or earlier? Maybe it wouldn't have happened. And then I start wondering about the other driver. Were they okay? I never found out. It's this loop of 'what ifs' that I can't seem to break out of.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty, I guess. And scared. It's like... I know logically it wasn't my fault, but there's this part of me that feels responsible somehow. And then I feel angry at myself for feeling guilty. It's exhausting, this back-and-forth in my head.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's frustrating. I've spent so much time trying to move past this, but it still affects me. I get angry at myself for not being 'over it' already. And then I get angry at the situation, at the unfairness of it all. Why did it have to happen to me? Why can't I just forget about it and move on like everyone tells me to?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your childhood experiences?",
    "Client: Oh... wow. I hadn't thought about that, but... I guess it does remind me of how I felt as a kid. Always walking on eggshells, never knowing when something bad might happen. That same feeling of helplessness, of not being in control. It's like... the accident brought all those old feelings back to the surface.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel like a little girl again, scared and alone. But there's also this... I don't know, relief? Like, maybe understanding this connection will help me process both traumas. It's a lot to take in, though. I feel drained, but also... maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How do you feel physically now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calmer now. My breathing's slowed down. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as intense. I feel heavy, like I could sink into this chair. My mind feels clearer, though. It's like... making that connection has lifted a fog I didn't even know was there.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I have more work to do, but in a good way? Like, maybe addressing my childhood trauma will help me process the accident better. It's scary to think about digging into all of that, but... I also feel like I understand myself a little better now. It's like I've found a missing piece of the puzzle.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm grateful, actually. It was hard, really hard. There were moments when I wanted to just get up and leave. But I'm glad I stayed. I feel like I've made progress, even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment. It's exhausting, but... I think it's worth it. I just hope I can hold onto this feeling of... I don't know, clarity? Understanding? When I leave here.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help you hold onto that?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe writing it down? I could journal about this connection we've made. And... I think I need to be kinder to myself. Recognize that healing isn't linear, and that it's okay to have setbacks. Maybe I could try some of those grounding techniques we've talked about when I start feeling overwhelmed by memories or emotions.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent strategies. Is there anything else you'd like to explore before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. I feel like I've processed a lot today. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired, if that makes sense? Like I've done something important. I'm a bit nervous about how I'll feel later, when I'm alone with my thoughts, but... I think I have some tools to help me cope now. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to do that breathing exercise we sometimes end with. It helps me feel centered before I leave. And maybe... could we review those grounding techniques quickly? Just so they're fresh in my mind. I want to feel prepared for whatever might come up later.",
