    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Bueno... I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. It's not easy to think about that day again. But I know it's important for my recovery, so I'm trying to stay positive.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and bring yourself back to the day of the earthquake. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my house, in the kitchen. It's early morning, maybe 6 AM. I'm making coffee, still groggy from sleep. The house is quiet, my wife is still in bed. Suddenly, I feel a slight tremor. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking gets stronger. Much stronger. The coffee mug falls off the counter and shatters. I hear a loud rumbling, like a freight train. I... I start to panic. I can't keep my balance.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now, Carlos?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 6? My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: [Deep breath] Right. So, I'm stumbling, trying to get to the bedroom to wake up Maria. The floor is moving so much, I have to hold onto the walls. I hear things crashing all around me. Pictures falling, glass breaking. I'm yelling for Maria, but it's so loud...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with it. What do you see when you get to the bedroom?",
    "Client: Maria's awake, terrified. She's trying to get out of bed, but she can't stand up. I reach for her, but then there's this awful cracking sound. I look up and... oh Dios m\u00edo... the ceiling is starting to cave in!",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath, Carlos. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Let's ground ourselves for a moment. Can you tell me three things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Uh... your desk, the plant in the corner, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's go back to that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: [Deep breath] Okay. I grab Maria's arm and pull her off the bed. We stumble towards the doorway, debris falling all around us. The noise is deafening - the house is groaning, things are smashing. We make it to the hallway, and I see a beam has fallen, blocking our path to the front door.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I... I don't know how we're going to get out. Maria is crying, clinging to me. I can smell dust and... something burning. Maybe electrical wires?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations, Carlos. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to think. The back door! I tell Maria we need to go to the kitchen. We're stumbling, the floor is still shaking. It feels like it's been going on forever, but I know it's only been a minute or two. We get to the kitchen, and I see the fridge has fallen, blocking the back door. I feel... God, I feel so trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take a moment to breathe. Can you feel your feet on the floor?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: [Deep breath] Okay. We're in the kitchen. The shaking is starting to lessen, but things are still falling. I see a gap between the fridge and the wall. I tell Maria we need to squeeze through. She's hesitant, scared, but I go first to show her it's okay. I feel the cold metal of the fridge against my skin as I push through. There's a moment where I think I might get stuck, and I panic...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling, Carlos. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I manage to get through. I turn back to help Maria. She's crying, shaking, but she follows me. As she's squeezing through, there's another strong tremor. I hear more crashing from inside the house. I grab Maria's hands and pull her through just as... just as part of the kitchen ceiling collapses where we were standing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. How are you feeling right now, Carlos?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest feels tight. But... but I also feel a sense of relief, remembering that we made it out.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves again. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now?",
    "Client: I hear... the air conditioning, a car passing outside, and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's continue. What happens after you and Maria get out of the house?",
    "Client: We stumble into the backyard. The ground is still shaking, but not as violently. I can hear screams and car alarms from all over the neighborhood. Our neighbors are out in their yards too, looking shocked. The air is filled with dust. I look back at our house and... and I see that half of it has collapsed. Our bedroom... it's just gone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing that?",
    "Client: I... I feel numb. Shocked. I can't believe what I'm seeing. Everything we've worked for, all our memories... just destroyed in minutes. But then I look at Maria, and I feel... grateful. We're alive. We made it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Carlos. What do you do next?",
    "Client: We move away from the house, afraid it might collapse further. We join our neighbors in the street. Everyone is in shock, some are crying, others are trying to call loved ones. The aftershocks keep coming. Each time, I feel a surge of fear, thinking it might get worse again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Carlos?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained. Exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Remembering how we survived, how we helped each other...",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's start to bring ourselves back to the present. Take a deep breath and slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: [Deep breath, opens eyes] Wow... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job, Carlos. How are you feeling now that we're back in the present?",
    "Client: I feel... tired. But also, I don't know, maybe a little proud? I haven't been able to talk about that day in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. You showed great courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I understand now why we're doing this. It's hard, but... I feel like I'm starting to process what happened, instead of just trying to forget it.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly right, Carlos. You're making great progress. We'll continue to work through this together. For now, take some time to relax and be kind to yourself. You've done some challenging work today.",
    "Client: Gracias, doc. I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. I'll see you next week. Take care."
