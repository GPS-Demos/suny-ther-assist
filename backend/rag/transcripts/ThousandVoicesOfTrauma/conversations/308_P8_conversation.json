    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that those men invaded our home, our safe space. I remember feeling so helpless, hiding in the closet with my husband. I was terrified they'd find us.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a burning sensation in my chest. My hands are clenched, and I notice I'm gritting my teeth. It's almost like my body wants to fight back now, even though it's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: And the fear?",
    "Client: The fear is... it's in my stomach. It's this cold, hollow feeling. My legs feel weak, like they did that night when I was frozen in place. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why us? Why our home?\" And then I feel guilty because... because we were lucky. They didn't hurt us physically. But the feeling of violation, of our privacy being invaded... it's overwhelming. I wonder if I'll ever feel truly safe in my own home again.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to right after the incident?",
    "Client: They're... they're less intense now, I suppose. Right after it happened, I couldn't sleep for days. Every little noise made me jump. I was constantly on edge, always expecting the worst. Now, it's... it's more of a background anxiety. But going through this exercise, it brings it all back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I can do it. Before, I'd try to push these thoughts and feelings away as soon as they came up. Now, I can... I can acknowledge them. They're uncomfortable, yes, but I'm not completely overwhelmed like I used to be. It's like... like I'm observing them from a slight distance.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, being able to observe these emotions?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, in a way. Don't get me wrong, it's still difficult and uncomfortable. But there's a part of me that feels... stronger? Like I'm facing this head-on instead of running from it. It's exhausting, but also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating?",
    "Therapist: What do you think has changed to allow this?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the work we've been doing. Learning to face these memories instead of avoiding them. And... and realizing that feeling these emotions won't actually hurt me. They're intense, yes, but they pass. I'm starting to believe that I can handle them.",
    "Therapist: How might this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I think it might help me feel more in control. Maybe I won't be as jumpy at night, or as anxious when I'm home alone. It's like... like I'm reclaiming my space, bit by bit. I'm not there yet, but I can see the possibility now. That feels... hopeful.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've learned that... that I'm stronger than I thought. I've always seen myself as this anxious person, you know? But going through this, facing these memories... it's shown me that I have resilience. I can face difficult things and come out the other side. It's not easy, but... but I can do it.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's pride, definitely. A sense of accomplishment. But also a bit of sadness, I guess? Sadness that I had to go through this to discover this strength. And maybe a little frustration that I didn't realize it sooner. But overall, it feels... good. Like I'm rediscovering parts of myself.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on feeling more secure in my home again. Maybe we could explore some strategies for that? I want to be able to relax in my own space without constantly being on guard. Is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This is... it's hard work, but I feel like I'm making progress. Sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back, you know? But overall, I think I'm moving in the right direction. I appreciate your guidance through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. See you next week."
