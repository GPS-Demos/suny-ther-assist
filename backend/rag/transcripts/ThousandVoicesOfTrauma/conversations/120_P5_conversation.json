    "Therapist: Hello Maria, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this imaginal exposure thing you mentioned last time.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to forget about what happened to me. The idea of deliberately bringing it all back up feels terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse? I've been having more nightmares lately just thinking about this session.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's discuss the purpose of this exercise.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening. But I'm still not sure about this. It's taken me so long to build a life for myself after what happened. I have a good job now, I'm independent. I'm worried this will set me back. And with all this cyberbullying stuff in the news lately, it's bringing up a lot of old feelings about being powerless and targeted.",
    "Therapist: I hear your concerns. This exercise aims to reduce PTSD symptoms over time. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense... But how exactly does reliving the trauma help? It seems counterintuitive. And what if I freeze up or panic during the exercise? I'm worried I'll embarrass myself or disappoint you somehow.",
    "Therapist: You won't disappoint me. Your safety is my priority. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Thompson. I know I can be difficult sometimes. It's just... this is all so overwhelming. But I trust you, and if you think this will help, I'm willing to try. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. I'll guide you through it, and we'll process your emotions together.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as scary as I imagined. Will I need to close my eyes? And what kind of questions will you be asking me? I'm worried about getting too emotional or not being able to speak. Sometimes when I think about what happened, it's like I'm right back there and I can't find my words.",
    "Therapist: Eye closure is optional. We'll focus on your feelings and sensations. Your responses can be brief if needed.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I can manage that. And you'll be right here with me the whole time, right? I'm feeling a bit better about this now, but still nervous. Is it normal to feel this anxious before starting?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely normal. I'll be here throughout. Your courage is commendable, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. That means a lot to me. I've come this far in my recovery, and I want to keep moving forward. Even if it's scary. I just hope this helps with the nightmares and the constant feeling of being on edge. It's exhausting living like this, always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we begin? Remember, we can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. But please, if you see me getting too distressed, can you help bring me back to the present? Sometimes I lose track of where I am when I think about the past.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll monitor you closely and help you stay grounded. Let's start..."
