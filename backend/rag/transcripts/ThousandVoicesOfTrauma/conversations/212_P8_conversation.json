    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also frozen at the same time. The memory of being locked in that dark room... it's so vivid now. I can feel the cold concrete floor beneath me, and the musty smell is overwhelming. My heart is pounding, just like it did back then.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that I was put in that situation, that I was neglected and treated like I didn't matter. My hands are shaking, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm back there, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I struggle with trusting people now. Even my husband - sometimes I feel like I can't fully open up to him. I'm always waiting for someone to lock me away, figuratively speaking. It's exhausting, constantly being on guard.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did this happen to me?\" And then I feel guilty for asking that because I know others have been through worse. But I can't shake the feeling that I deserved better. I deserved to be cared for, not locked away and forgotten.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you share this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That it's okay to feel this way, that I'm not overreacting. And maybe... maybe I need to know that I'm not alone. That someone sees me and understands what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. I see you, and your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means more than you know. It's hard to let myself be vulnerable like this. Growing up, showing emotion was seen as weakness. But here I am, crying in front of you, and... it actually feels okay. Like maybe it's safe to let my guard down, just a little.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to let your guard down?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Scary, but also like a weight is being lifted. I've spent so long trying to be strong, to pretend that what happened didn't affect me. But acknowledging it, feeling these emotions... it's like I'm finally allowing myself to heal.",
    "Therapist: What does healing look like for you?",
    "Client: I think... it looks like being able to trust again. To not flinch when someone comes too close. To be able to enjoy moments with my family without constantly worrying about what might go wrong. And maybe... maybe it means forgiving myself for what happened, even though I know logically it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How can you move towards that?",
    "Client: I suppose... by continuing to face these memories, as hard as it is. By talking about it, like we're doing now. And maybe by being kinder to myself? I'm always so critical of my reactions, but maybe I need to accept that it's okay to still be affected by what happened.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that approach?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Scary, but right. Like I'm finally on the path I need to be on. I've spent so long running from these feelings, but facing them head-on... it's terrifying, but also empowering. I feel like I'm taking back control of my life, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I think... I could try to open up to my husband about one small aspect of what happened. Not the whole story, but maybe just share how it affects me sometimes. It's a scary thought, but I think it could help break down some of the walls I've built.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've done some important work today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe that it's worth it. I'm nervous about the week ahead, but also a little excited to try taking that small step we talked about.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. And... thank you for creating a safe space for me to explore these difficult memories and feelings. It means more than I can express."
