    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that natural disaster, it's still so vivid. I can still hear the wind howling, feel the ground shaking. It's like I'm right back there, you know? And then, with everything else that's happened in my life... it just feels overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, I guess. The absolute terror of not knowing if I'd survive. But also... and this is hard to admit... a strange sense of excitement? Is that wrong? I mean, it was a disaster, people were hurt, but part of me felt... alive. Maybe it's because of my substance use, always chasing that next high. I don't know.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving it feel today?",
    "Client: Intense. Really intense. My heart was racing, palms sweating. I wanted to run, to hide. But... I didn't. I stayed with it. That's progress, right? It's just... it brought up other memories too. Things I'd rather forget.",
    "Therapist: Like what?",
    "Client: The... the sexual abuse. I know we're focusing on the disaster, but it all feels connected somehow. The helplessness, the fear. It's like my body doesn't know the difference sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do you see them connecting?",
    "Client: I guess... in both situations, I felt powerless. Out of control. And afterwards, I turned to substances to cope. It's been my go-to for so long. But going through this therapy, reliving these memories... it's making me realize how much I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: What's that realization like for you?",
    "Client: Scary. But also... empowering? I mean, I'm here, right? I'm facing it. That's something my younger self could never have done. Growing up in a South Asian family, we didn't talk about these things. Trauma, addiction... it was all swept under the rug. But I'm breaking that cycle.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How else has this process affected you?",
    "Client: It's... it's changing how I see myself. I used to think I was weak for not being able to \"get over it.\" But now I understand it's not about getting over it, it's about processing it. Learning to live with it. And in my shared accommodation, I'm starting to open up more to my housemates. Baby steps, but... it feels good.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's helping you open up?",
    "Client: I think... it's the realization that I'm not alone. That my experiences, while unique to me, are part of the human experience. And talking about it here, in this safe space, it's giving me the confidence to share bits and pieces out there. It's like... the more I face it, the less power it has over me.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift in power feel?",
    "Client: Liberating. Terrifying. But mostly... hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I have a future. Like maybe I can have healthy relationships, a life without substances. It's not easy, and some days are harder than others, but... I'm starting to believe it's possible.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that hope?",
    "Client: This process, I guess. The fact that I can sit here and talk about these things without completely falling apart. The small changes I'm noticing in my day-to-day life. I'm sleeping a bit better, I'm less jumpy. And... I'm starting to feel things again. Not just the bad stuff, but moments of joy, of peace. It's like I'm coming back to life.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing myself. To keep facing these memories, no matter how hard it gets. To be more open with the people in my life. And... I think I want to explore my cultural background more. To see how my experiences as a South Asian man have shaped me, for better or worse. It's all part of my story, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For creating this space, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time, I feel like I'm on the right path. It's not just about surviving anymore. I'm starting to think about thriving.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next session."
