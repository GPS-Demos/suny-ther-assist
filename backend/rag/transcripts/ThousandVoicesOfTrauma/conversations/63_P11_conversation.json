    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure, to be honest. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going back to that time in the hospital, when I was so sick and alone... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to bury for years.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It was deafening. I remember lying there, hour after hour, with no one coming to check on me. The beeping of the machines was my only company. I kept thinking, \"If I die right now, would anyone even notice?\" It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of abandonment, even now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly isolating. How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I could almost smell the antiseptic again, feel the scratchy hospital gown. My heart started racing, just like it did back then. I felt so... small and insignificant. Like I was disappearing into that bed, and no one would ever find me again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It doesn't feel like courage, though. It feels like I'm drowning in old pain. I've spent so many years trying to numb this with alcohol, you know? But now, it's like I'm feeling everything at once, and I don't know how to handle it.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I push people away. Why I ended up divorced and alone. I'm so terrified of being abandoned again that I don't let anyone get close enough to leave me. And the drinking... it's been my way of silencing that scared, lonely voice inside me. But it's not working anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What do you think about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also a bit liberating? Like, maybe if I understand why I do these things, I can start to change them. But I'm also worried... what if I'm too old to change? What if I've wasted too much time?",
    "Therapist: It's never too late. How might you move forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to start reaching out more. Maybe reconnect with my kids, try to explain why I've been so distant. And... and I think I need to be honest with myself about my drinking. It's not just a habit, it's a crutch, and it's time I learned to walk without it.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Could we... could we work on some strategies for dealing with these memories without turning to alcohol? And maybe... maybe some ways to start conversations with my family? I'm not sure I even remember how to do that anymore.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on those areas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... hopeful? Like maybe there's a way out of this darkness I've been living in. It's terrifying, but also... exciting? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a natural part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to keep going. It's hard, but... I think it's worth it. I want to feel alive again, you know? Not just... existing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Shall we continue?"
