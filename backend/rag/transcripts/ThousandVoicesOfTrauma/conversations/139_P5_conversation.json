    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I saw on the schedule that we're starting something new?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How much do you know about it?",
    "Client: Not much, honestly. I've heard it involves talking about the trauma, which scares me a bit. Especially with everything going on online lately...",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've been dealing with a lot of cyber bullying recently. It's bringing up memories of the abuse, and I'm worried talking about it will make things worse. Plus, I don't want my wife to see me upset when I get home.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think this might affect our session?",
    "Client: I'm just... I'm afraid of losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down and can't stop crying? Or what if I get angry and lash out? I don't want to embarrass myself or disappoint you.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain more about what we'll be doing? And maybe tell me it's okay if I need to stop or take a break? I just need to know I have some control over the situation.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let me explain the process and we'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... this is all so new and scary. But I trust you, and I know you're here to help me. Can you tell me more about what imaginal exposure actually involves?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's revisiting the trauma memory in a safe space. Shall I continue?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm listening. It's making me a bit anxious, but I want to understand what we'll be doing.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You'll describe the event, and I'll guide you through.",
    "Client: Okay... that doesn't sound as scary as I thought. But what if I start to panic or feel overwhelmed? Will you be able to help me calm down?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm just worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be okay to go home? To be around my wife?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional after. We'll debrief and ensure you're stable before leaving.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate you taking the time to explain all this to me. It's helping me feel a bit more prepared. Is there anything else I should know or do to get ready for this?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Your courage is admirable. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm okay for now. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. I'm still nervous, but I feel better knowing what to expect. I'm ready to try this if you think it will help me.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a big step. Shall we begin?",
