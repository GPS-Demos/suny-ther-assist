    "Therapist: Hello, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Chen. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been on my mind a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about the neglect I experienced, and my recent divorce has brought up a lot of those old feelings. The idea of purposely reliving those memories feels terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help. I mean, I trust you, Dr. Chen, but this feels like a big step. I'm worried about falling apart or losing control. And honestly, I'm not sure how reliving those painful memories is supposed to help me move forward. Isn't it better to just... leave the past in the past?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. It may be uncomfortable but can reduce symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see... So, you're saying that by facing these memories head-on, I might actually be able to reduce their power over me? That's an interesting way to look at it. But what exactly will we be doing? And how will you make sure I'm okay during the process?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit a specific memory. I'll guide you through it, ensuring you feel safe. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate that we can stop if it gets too overwhelming. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand the purpose better now. Can you tell me more about what I might experience during the exercise? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions or physical sensations. This is normal. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's not just about remembering, but also about experiencing and processing those feelings in a safe environment? That makes sense, but it's still scary. I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I start crying uncontrollably or have a panic attack?",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. I'm here to support you. We'll go at your pace and use coping strategies if needed.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. Your reassurance means a lot. I guess I'm just realizing how much I've avoided dealing with these memories and emotions. It's like I've built this wall around them, and now we're planning to take it down. It's terrifying, but also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not weird at all. It's a courageous step. How do you feel about trying it today?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. You've helped me understand the process better, and knowing that we can stop if needed gives me some comfort. I trust you, Dr. Chen, and I want to work through this. My recent divorce has shown me how much these old wounds still affect me. If this can help me move forward and have healthier relationships in the future, then I want to do it. Can we start with something small today?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start gently. Your bravery is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm taking a deep breath and reminding myself that I'm safe here with you. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to face these memories and start healing. Thank you for your patience and guidance, Dr. Chen. I feel like I'm finally taking a step towards truly dealing with my past instead of just trying to ignore it."
