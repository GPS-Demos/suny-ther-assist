    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week, and I'm not sure what to expect. My heart's racing a bit just sitting here.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... ever since my illness, I've been struggling to feel normal again. Everything seems to remind me of those awful days in the hospital. I can't seem to shake it off, you know?",
    "Therapist: Today, we'll try imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it involves. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's very helpful. Shall I explain?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what we're going to do. I'm feeling a bit nervous about it all.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your trauma memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit it? You mean... I have to think about being in the hospital again? I'm not sure I can do that. Just the thought of it makes me feel panicky. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you. But can you tell me more about why we need to do this? It seems counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been trying so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. So, by facing it head-on, I might be able to stop these constant flashbacks and nightmares? That would be... that would be incredible. I haven't had a full night's sleep in months.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How do you feel about trying it today?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but I'm also hopeful. If this can help me get my life back, I want to try. Can you tell me what I should expect during the session? Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. We'll start slowly and pause if needed.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I'm glad you'll be there with me. I'm worried about getting overwhelmed by the memories. Sometimes, when I think about the hospital, it feels so real... like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone who understands. My family tries, but they don't really get it. They think I should just \"move on.\" But it's not that simple, is it?",
    "Therapist: It's not. Your feelings are valid. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is all new and pretty scary for me. But I want to get better, for myself and for my family.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your courage is admirable. Let's start."
