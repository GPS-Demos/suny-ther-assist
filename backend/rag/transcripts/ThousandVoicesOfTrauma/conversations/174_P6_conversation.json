    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment of imprisonment? What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm trying... It's hard to go back there. I'd say my SUDS is about a 4 right now. I can feel my heart starting to beat a bit faster.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take your time.",
    "Client: I'm picturing the cold, damp cell. The smell of mold and sweat is overwhelming. I can hear the distant sound of metal doors slamming shut. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. The walls seem to be closing in on me. I'm... I'm starting to panic a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6 now? My palms are sweaty, and I feel dizzy. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, trapped in there with no way out. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember curling up in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. The guards' footsteps echoed in the hallway, and each time they passed, I held my breath, terrified they'd stop at my cell. My SUDS is definitely at an 8 now. I feel like I'm suffocating.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Breathe. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My whole body is tense, and I feel nauseous. But... I'm also aware that I'm here, in this room with you. It's like I'm straddling two worlds. The memory is vivid, but I know it's not happening right now. My SUDS is hovering around 7.",
    "Therapist: That's good awareness. Continue.",
    "Client: As I sit there in the cell, I start to think about my childhood. How unfair it all was, how I ended up here because of what happened to me as a kid. I feel this surge of anger and sadness. It's overwhelming. My SUDS is back up to 9. I want to scream, to punch the walls, but I know I can't.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 7 again? I'm remembering how I used to cope in there. I'd close my eyes and imagine I was somewhere else, anywhere else. It helped a little. My breathing is slowing down now, but I still feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it like this... it's hard, but it's also kind of freeing? Like, I've carried this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. My SUDS is at a 5 now. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. My SUDS is down to a 3. The memory is still there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. It's like I've taken some of its power away just by facing it head-on like this.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's end here. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess? And exhausted. But also hopeful. Like maybe I can get through this after all. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the work. Well done. We'll continue next time."
