    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm there. It's the day I found out about my brother's death. I'm at work, and my phone rings. It's my mom... her voice is shaky. She tells me there's been an incident with the police. My brother... he's gone. I feel like the world is spinning. My chest tightens, and I can't breathe.",

    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",

    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight. I'm angry, so angry. Why did this happen? He didn't deserve this.",
