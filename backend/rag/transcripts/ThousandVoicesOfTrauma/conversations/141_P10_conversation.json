    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a knot in my stomach, and I keep thinking maybe we should just call it off. But I know that's not going to help in the long run. It's just... it's hard, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start with the beginning of the incident. Remember to use present tense.",
    "Client: Okay... um... I'm at home. It's evening, and I can hear the rain outside. I'm sitting on the couch, trying to watch TV, but I can't focus. My partner... they're in the kitchen, and I can hear them slamming cupboards. The noise is making me tense. I... I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 4? It's uncomfortable, but not too bad yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: They come into the living room. Their face is... it's twisted with anger. I can smell alcohol on their breath. They're yelling about something... I can't even remember what. It doesn't matter, really. I try to calm them down, but that just makes it worse. They grab my arm, hard. It hurts. I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to pull away, but their grip is too strong. They're screaming in my face now. I can feel spit hitting my cheek. I'm... I'm scared. Really scared. My SUDS is probably a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... They push me. I stumble back and hit the coffee table. There's a sharp pain in my hip. I'm on the ground now, and they're standing over me. I can see their fist clenching. I close my eyes, waiting for the blow...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The first hit lands on my shoulder. It's like an explosion of pain. I cry out, but that just seems to encourage them. They're kicking me now. I curl up, trying to protect myself. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm... I'm sobbing, begging them to stop. But they don't. They just keep going.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *nods* Eventually, they stop. I hear them stumble away, muttering something. I'm lying there on the floor, everything hurts. I'm shaking. I can hear them in the kitchen again, opening another bottle. I... I don't move. I'm afraid if I do, they'll come back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Ashamed. Why didn't I fight back? Why do I let this happen? I'm a grown man, for God's sake. I should be able to defend myself. But I just... I just lie there, hoping it's over.",
    "Therapist: Those are common feelings. Remember, it's not your fault.",
    "Client: *sighs* I know that logically, but it's hard to believe sometimes. I eventually manage to get up. Everything hurts. I look in the mirror and see a bruise forming on my cheek. I... I feel so alone. So trapped.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I grab some clothes and my phone. I wait until I hear them pass out on the couch, then I sneak out. I drive to a friend's house. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely steer. When I get there, I sit in the car for a long time before I can bring myself to knock on the door.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to about a 6. It's... it's getting easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: My friend opens the door. She takes one look at me and just... knows. She doesn't ask questions, just leads me inside. I'm grateful for that. I don't think I could explain right then. She gets me some ice for my face and makes me tea. We sit in silence for a while.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how I got here. How many times this has happened before. I'm wondering if I'll ever have the strength to leave for good. I feel so weak, so pathetic. But there's also a tiny part of me that feels... relieved. Like maybe this time, I'll actually do something about it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But also kind of empowering? Like maybe I'm not completely helpless after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. What happens next?",
    "Client: My friend finally asks if I want to talk about it. I do, but I don't know where to start. I end up just... breaking down. Sobbing like a child. She holds me, and for the first time in a long time, I feel safe. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that safety. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4. Talking about it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We talk for hours. She helps me see that this isn't normal, that I don't deserve this. She offers to let me stay with her for a while. I... I accept. It feels like a huge step, but also like a weight lifting off my chest.",
    "Therapist: That was a brave decision. How do you feel about it now?",
    "Client: Scared, but... hopeful? Like maybe this is the first step towards something better. I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can do this.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's pause here. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's still hard to talk about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. My SUDS is down to about a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *takes deep breaths* Thank you. This... this helps.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you're stronger than you think.",
    "Client: Yeah... I'm starting to believe that. It's a strange feeling, but a good one.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Shall we end the session here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've accomplished something.",
    "Therapist: You have. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I think I am."
