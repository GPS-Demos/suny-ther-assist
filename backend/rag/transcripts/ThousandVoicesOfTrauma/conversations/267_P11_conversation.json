    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I thought I had put that memory behind me, but going through it again... it felt so real. The park, the dog, the fear... it all came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The sound. The growling. It was so loud, so threatening. I could feel my heart racing just like it did that day. And the helplessness... I felt so small and vulnerable, just like when I was bullied in school. It's funny how these things connect, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How did reliving it feel different this time?",
    "Client: Well, I... I noticed I could breathe through it better. Like, I was scared, but I knew I was here, safe. It's progress, I think. But it's still hard, you know? I keep wondering why these things happen to me.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural question. What thoughts come up?",
    "Client: I guess... I wonder if I'm somehow attracting these experiences. First the bullying, now this. It makes me feel... weak, I suppose. Like I can't protect myself. And that feeds into my depression, makes me feel worthless sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I want to feel strong again. Capable. I want to be able to go to the park without constantly looking over my shoulder. And I want to stop feeling like a victim all the time. It's exhausting, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What strategies have helped so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been surprisingly helpful. And... talking about it like this, it helps me see the incident more clearly. It's not just a blur of fear anymore. I can separate the parts of the memory, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me realize how much I've been isolating myself. I used to love going out, meeting friends. Now I make excuses to stay home. My husband, he's worried. I can see it in his eyes. I want to get back to being me, you know?",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What small step could you take?",
    "Client: I've been thinking... maybe I could start by walking in our neighborhood. Just short distances at first. Maybe even ask my husband to come with me. It's not the park, but... it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. How does that idea feel?",
    "Client: It's a bit scary, to be honest. But also... hopeful? Like, maybe I can do this. Maybe I can reclaim my life bit by bit. It won't be easy, but... I'm tired of letting fear control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much anger I've been holding onto. Not just about the dog attack, but about the bullying too. It's like... I'm angry at the world for making me feel this way. But I'm also angry at myself for not being able to just \"get over it,\" you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How might you address that anger?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe... maybe I need to be kinder to myself? Accept that healing takes time? It's hard, though. I've always been hard on myself. It's how I succeeded in my business, but now... it feels like it's holding me back.",
    "Therapist: Self-compassion can be powerful. Any other insights?",
    "Client: I think... I need to talk to my family more. About how I'm feeling, what I'm going through. I've been trying to protect them, but maybe... maybe that's not helping anyone. They want to support me, I know that. I just need to let them in.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. There's still a long way to go, I know that. But for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe... maybe I can do this. Maybe I can heal.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on strategies for managing my anxiety when I'm out. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about how to open up to my family? I want to, but I'm not sure how to start.",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. Any last thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I'm not an easy patient. I'm stubborn, set in my ways. But... this is helping. It's hard, but it's helping. I'm grateful for that.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mrs. Lee. See you next week."
