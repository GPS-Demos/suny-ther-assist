    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week. The idea of revisiting that night... it's unsettling. But I'm here, and I'm trying to stay open-minded.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we discuss the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. I've been wondering about it. What exactly will it involve? I'm not sure I can handle reliving that home invasion in detail. It still feels so raw, even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: It's a guided process. We'll focus on the memory gradually. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still anxious about it. Will it make things worse? I've worked so hard to keep those memories at bay. The thought of deliberately bringing them up... it's frightening.",
    "Therapist: Understandable concern. This approach helps process trauma, reducing its impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like facing it head-on instead of avoiding it? That makes sense, but it's still scary. Will you be there the whole time? I'm not sure I can do this alone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate your support. I've been dealing with this for so long, and the anxiety it causes... it's exhausting. I'm willing to try if you think it will help. What should I expect to feel during the process?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. It's normal and part of healing.",
    "Client: Strong emotions... I'm used to those, I suppose. But in a controlled environment like this, maybe it won't be so overwhelming. I'm curious, how long does this usually take? Is it something we'll do in one session, or is it a longer process?",
    "Therapist: It's typically spread across sessions. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I was worried it would be too intense to handle all at once. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. It's just... this is a big step for me. After the bullying I experienced in my youth and now this home invasion, I've struggled with feeling safe. I'm hoping this will help.",
    "Therapist: Your questions show readiness. This process aims to restore your sense of safety.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear you acknowledge the impact this has had on me. I'm nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this could be a turning point. Is there anything I should do to prepare for our next session when we start this process?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your willingness is the best preparation.",
    "Client: Alright, I can do that. I'm grateful for your guidance and support through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe it might be worth it. Thank you for being patient with me and answering all my questions. I feel a bit more prepared now, even if I'm still nervous.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll face this together, step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot to me. I'm glad we had this conversation today. It's helped me feel more prepared and less anxious about what's to come. I'm still nervous, of course, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm taking control back, in a way. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely normal. That strength will grow as we progress.",
    "Client: That's encouraging to hear. I'm looking forward to our next session, even with the nerves. Thank you for your time today and for explaining everything so clearly. It's made a real difference in how I'm feeling about this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
