    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my childhood bedroom. It's dark, and I can hear my parents arguing downstairs. The shouting is getting louder, and I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I'm hiding under my blanket, trying to block out the noise. My heart is racing, and I feel so small and helpless. I want to go check on my little sister, but I'm too afraid to leave my room.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The arguing suddenly stops, and I hear the front door slam. Then I hear my mom crying. I'm frozen in my bed, unsure of what to do. I feel guilty for not helping, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. It's okay to feel those emotions.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. It feels like the walls are closing in on me. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I'm shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: I'm trying, but it's so hard. I can still hear my mom's sobs echoing through the house. I feel so alone and scared. Why didn't anyone come to check on us?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing great by staying with the memory.",
    "Client: As the night goes on, I can't sleep. I keep thinking about what might happen tomorrow. Will Dad come back? Will Mom be okay? I feel responsible for my sister, but I'm just a kid myself. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The sun starts to rise, and I haven't slept at all. I'm exhausted but too afraid to close my eyes. When I finally leave my room, the house feels different. There's a heaviness in the air that I can't explain. Mom's eyes are red and puffy, and she tries to smile at us, but it doesn't reach her eyes. I want to ask what happened, but I'm scared of the answer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Reliving that night brings back so many painful emotions. The fear, the guilt, the helplessness \u2013 it's all still there. But there's also a strange sense of relief in finally talking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel all of those emotions. You're processing them well.",
    "Client: I've carried this memory for so long, never really understanding how it affected me. Now I can see how it shaped my anxiety, my need for control. I always felt like I had to be the strong one, to protect everyone else, even when I was just a child myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also sad. I wish I could go back and tell that scared little boy that it wasn't his fault, that he didn't have to carry all that weight on his shoulders.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful sentiment. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. I've always struggled with letting people in, with trusting others. Now I can see why. That night, I felt so alone and unprotected. It's no wonder I've had trouble feeling safe in relationships.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable insight. How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. My chest isn't as tight as it was when we started. My hands are still shaking a little, but not as badly. It's like I've released some of the tension I've been holding onto for years.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You're doing great work here.",
    "Client: I never realized how much that night affected me. It's like it set the tone for how I approach life \u2013 always on edge, always waiting for the next crisis. But talking about it like this, it feels like I'm taking some of its power away.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I am, actually. It's strange, but I feel proud that I'm finally facing this. For so long, I've tried to push these memories away, to pretend they didn't affect me. But now, talking about it, I feel like I'm reclaiming a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an incredible realization. How do you want to move forward from here?",
    "Client: I think... I want to explore this more. To understand how this experience has shaped my relationships, especially with my wife. I want to learn how to feel safe, how to trust that not every argument means abandonment. And maybe... maybe I need to have a conversation with my sister about that night. We've never really talked about it.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. We'll work on them together.",
    "Client: Thank you. This session was harder than I expected, but I feel like I've taken a big step forward. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful about dealing with this.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful place to end our session. You've done remarkable work today."
