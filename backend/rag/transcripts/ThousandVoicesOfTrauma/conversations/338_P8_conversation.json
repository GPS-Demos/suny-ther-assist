    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm right back there, watching it all happen again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep seeing their faces. The fear in my mom's eyes, the anger in my dad's. I was so small, so helpless. I remember thinking, \"Why can't I make it stop?\" It's... it's overwhelming. I feel like I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: And how does that make you feel now?",
    "Client: Guilty. Ashamed. But also... angry? I'm angry at them for putting me through that, for making me feel responsible somehow. And I'm angry at myself for still being affected by it after all these years. It's like... shouldn't I be over this by now?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a little. I feel... exposed, I guess? Like everyone can see right through me, see all my flaws and weaknesses. It's making me want to retreat, to hide. But at the same time, there's this tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of pushing it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. Can you tell me more about that feeling of relief?",
    "Client: It's strange, really. It's like... for so long, I've been carrying this weight, this secret. And now that I'm talking about it, it's like the weight is shifting. Not gone, but... different. I've spent so much energy trying to forget, to pretend it didn't happen. But now, facing it... it's terrifying, but also... freeing? Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How does this compare to how you've felt in the past?",
    "Client: In the past, whenever these memories came up, I'd just shut down. I'd feel numb, detached. But now... it's like I'm feeling everything at once. It's intense and scary, but also... real? I feel more present, more connected to myself. It's uncomfortable, but also... I don't know, maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you think this means for your healing journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is scared. If I keep doing this, keep facing these memories, will it get worse before it gets better? But another part of me feels... hopeful? Like maybe by confronting this, I can start to move past it. Maybe I can stop letting it control my life, my relationships. It's just... it's a lot to process, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: The tightness in my chest is easing a bit. I'm still shaky, but not as much. I feel... drained, honestly. Like I've run a marathon. But also... lighter? It's hard to explain. It's like I've been holding my breath for years, and I'm finally starting to exhale.",
    "Therapist: That's a vivid description. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I need a moment. Just to sit with this, to let it settle. And maybe... maybe to remind myself that I'm safe now. That I'm not that helpless child anymore. It's over, but I'm still here. I survived. Is it okay if we just... sit in silence for a minute?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to continue. This is hard, but... I think it's important. I want to understand this part of myself better, to stop running from it. I just... I hope it gets easier.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk more about how this affects my current relationships. Especially with my wife. Sometimes, when we argue, I feel that same helplessness, that same fear. I want to understand why, and how to change it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great direction. Let's explore that.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, the other day, we had a disagreement about finances. It wasn't even a big deal, but I felt myself tensing up, getting defensive. It was like I was that little boy again, feeling trapped and scared. I snapped at her, then immediately felt guilty. I don't want to keep repeating this pattern, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... in both situations, I feel powerless. When I was a kid, I couldn't stop the violence. Now, as an adult, I still sometimes feel like I can't control what's happening. It's like... I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for things to explode. And that fear... it makes me lash out sometimes, or shut down completely.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What do you think you need to feel more in control?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... to remind myself that I'm not that helpless child anymore? That I have choices now, that I can communicate, that not every disagreement has to end in violence or fear. It's just... it's hard to remember that in the moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How might you practice this?",
    "Client: I could... maybe try to pause when I feel that fear rising. Take a deep breath, remind myself where I am, who I'm with. Maybe even tell my wife what I'm feeling. It's scary to be that vulnerable, but... maybe it would help her understand. And help me feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... intimidating. But also kind of exciting? Like, maybe this is a way I can start to break this cycle. To be the husband I want to be, not the scared kid I used to be. It's going to take practice, and probably a lot of uncomfortable conversations. But... I think it's worth it. I want to be present in my life, in my relationships, not constantly reacting to ghosts from my past.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to talk to my wife. Not about everything, not yet. But maybe explain a little about why I react the way I do sometimes. And ask for her patience as I work through this. And then... I guess I keep coming here, keep facing these memories. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing great courage and insight.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but... I think I'm starting to see a way forward. A way to acknowledge my past without letting it dictate my future. It's scary, but... also kind of exciting. Like I'm finally taking control of my own story, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful perspective. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I feel drained, but also... hopeful? Like I've taken a big step today. Thank you for guiding me through this. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care."
