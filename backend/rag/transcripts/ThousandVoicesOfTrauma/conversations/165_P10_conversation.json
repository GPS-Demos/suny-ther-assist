    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is scared to go back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? My stomach feels a bit tight just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the sky. It's so dark, almost green. The wind is picking up, and I can hear this low rumble in the distance. My abuela is calling for me to come inside, but I'm frozen on the porch, just staring at the clouds.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I'm... I'm scared, but also kind of in awe. It's like nothing I've ever seen before.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The wind gets stronger. I can hear things starting to crash around us. Branches, maybe? Abuela grabs my arm, and we rush inside. The house is creaking, and I can see the fear in her eyes. She's trying to stay calm for me, but I know she's terrified too.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. We're huddled in the hallway now. The noise outside is deafening. It sounds like a freight train. I'm holding onto Abuela so tight, and she's praying in Spanish. I can barely hear her over the storm.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. I'm shaking. I can feel Abuela's arms around me, but it doesn't feel safe. Nothing feels safe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a loud crack, and suddenly part of the roof is just... gone. Rain and debris are pouring in. Abuela pushes me under a table, and she's trying to cover me with her body. I'm crying, screaming. I can't... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: What's happening now?",
    "Client: The storm seems to last forever. I don't know how long we're there. Eventually, it starts to quiet down. Abuela is still holding me, whispering that it's going to be okay. But when we finally come out... God, everything is destroyed. Our home, our neighborhood. It's all just... gone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Debris everywhere. Trees uprooted. Cars overturned. It's like a war zone. And the silence... it's eerie. No birds, no people. Just... nothing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Maria?",
    "Client: I feel... lost. Overwhelmed. There's this hollow feeling in my chest. Like everything I knew is just... gone.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We start walking, Abuela and me. We're looking for neighbors, for anyone. There's water everywhere, and we have to be careful of downed power lines. I see a doll in the rubble \u2013 it belongs to the little girl next door. And I just... I lose it. I start sobbing uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... how can we recover from this? Where is everyone? Are they okay? And... oh God, I'm so grateful Abuela is with me, but I'm terrified for my parents. They were at work in the city.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: We make it to a makeshift shelter at the community center. It's crowded, chaotic. People are crying, shouting for loved ones. The smell of fear and sweat is overwhelming. Abuela is trying to find someone with a working phone, but everything's down.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Why did this happen to us? And guilty... because I'm alive when others might not be.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What happens next?",
    "Client: We spend the night there. It's uncomfortable, cold. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I hear the storm again. The next morning, relief workers start to arrive. They're bringing water, food, blankets. But all I want is news about my parents.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: It's late afternoon when I finally hear my mom's voice. Someone lent us a phone, and we got through. She's okay. Dad's okay. They couldn't get to us because of the roads, but they're coming. I break down crying again, but this time it's relief.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling of relief. What does it feel like in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... a weight lifting. I can breathe again. My shoulders relax. But there's still this knot in my stomach because... we've lost so much.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens when your parents arrive?",
    "Client: They get there the next day. I see them walking towards us, and I just run. I'm sobbing, clinging to them. We're all crying. It's... it's bittersweet. We're together, we're alive, but our home is gone. Everything is gone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment of reunion?",
    "Client: Grateful. So, so grateful. But also... guilty. Because I know not everyone was as lucky as us.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after such events. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's lower. Maybe 45?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens in the days following?",
    "Client: It's a blur of clean-up efforts, insurance calls, trying to salvage what we can. The community comes together, which is beautiful, but it's also... it's overwhelming. Every time I hear a loud noise, I flinch. At night, I have nightmares about the storm.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these reactions?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. Help with the rebuilding efforts. But sometimes it's too much, and I just need to be alone. Abuela notices. She starts teaching me her breathing exercises, the ones she uses when she prays.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a helpful coping strategy. What else?",
    "Client: I start writing. Just... getting it all out on paper. It helps, sometimes. But other times, it brings it all back, and I feel like I'm right there in the storm again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's hard to talk about, but I feel... lighter? Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay.",
    "Therapist: As we end this session, what are your thoughts?",
    "Client: It's still painful to remember, but... I can see how far we've come. How strong we were. Are. It doesn't control me like it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight, Maria. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. Do you have any questions?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, Maria. I'm proud of how you handled this session. Let's end here for today."
