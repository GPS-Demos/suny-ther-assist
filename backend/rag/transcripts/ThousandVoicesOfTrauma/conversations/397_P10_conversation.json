    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Gracias, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. My hands are a little shaky. But I know this is important work we're doing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 right now. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I think so. (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back at my sister's house. It's a warm evening, and I can smell dinner cooking. Carmen always made the best arroz con pollo. I'm helping her in the kitchen, chopping vegetables, and we're laughing about something silly her son did at school.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: (voice trembles slightly) We hear a loud bang outside. At first, we think it's just kids playing with firecrackers, you know? But then there's shouting, and more bangs. Carmen looks at me, and I can see the fear in her eyes. We both know it's gunshots.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7? My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we run to the living room. Carmen's grabbing her phone to call the police, and I'm trying to get the kids away from the windows. I can hear more shouting outside, angry voices. The kids are crying, and I'm trying to keep them quiet. I'm so scared, but I have to be strong for them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) There's another loud bang, closer this time. Glass shatters \u2013 oh Dios m\u00edo, a bullet's come through the window! I push Carmen and the kids to the ground, covering them with my body. I can feel my heart pounding so hard, like it might burst out of my chest. The kids are sobbing, and Carmen's whispering prayers.",
    "Therapist: Breathe, Maria. You're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see shards of glass on the carpet. The curtains are moving in the breeze from the broken window. And there's... there's blood. (gasps) Carmen's been hit! She's clutching her arm, and there's blood seeping through her fingers. I'm trying to stay calm, but inside I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Focus on my voice. You're here, in my office. Take a slow, deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there, but I can hear you too.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I tear off a piece of my shirt to wrap around Carmen's arm. The kids are huddled against me, trembling. I can hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. But the shooting hasn't stopped. It feels like it's been hours, but I know it's only been minutes. I'm praying, begging God to keep us safe, to make it stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The police arrive, and suddenly there's even more shouting. I hear someone yell \"Drop your weapons!\" There's more gunfire, but it sounds different \u2013 must be the police. Then... then it's quiet. So quiet it's almost worse than the noise. We're all holding our breath, waiting.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my muscles are so tense. My jaw hurts from clenching it. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a knock at the door, and a voice saying it's the police. I'm... I'm so relieved, but also terrified to move. I slowly get up, my legs shaking. I open the door, and there are officers everywhere. Paramedics rush in to help Carmen. The kids are still crying, clinging to me. I... I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8? My heart is still racing.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... I'm... I'm watching the paramedics work on Carmen. They're saying she'll be okay, it's just a flesh wound. But all I can think is how close we came to... to losing her. To losing all of us. I feel guilty \u2013 why couldn't I protect them better? Why did this happen to us?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. Remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I know, but... it's hard. I keep thinking about what if the bullet had hit one of the kids instead? Or if more had come through the window? I... I can't stop these thoughts.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those thoughts. Let them come and go.",
    "Client: (sniffles) The police are asking us questions, but I can barely focus. Everything feels surreal, like a horrible nightmare. I keep hoping I'll wake up, but I know this is real. The kids won't let go of me, and I'm holding them so tight. I never want to let them go.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My SUDS is maybe a 7 now? I feel like I've lived through it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I... I can feel the chair I'm sitting in. I can hear the clock ticking. I'm... I'm here, in your office. It's over.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you notice around you?",

    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it. My SUDS is down to about a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: You did very well, Maria. How was this experience for you?",
    "Client: It was intense. Scary. But... but also, I feel like I faced it. Like maybe it doesn't have as much power over me now? I don't know if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. You showed great courage today.",
    "Client: Gracias, Dr. Thompson. I... I think I need a moment to just sit quietly now, if that's okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. We'll discuss this more when you're ready.",
    "Client: (nods silently, closes eyes, and takes deep breaths)",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Maria. When you're ready, we'll talk about what you've accomplished today."
