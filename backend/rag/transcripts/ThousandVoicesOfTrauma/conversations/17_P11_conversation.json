    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of that accident, the chaos at the refugee camp... it all feels so vivid again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The screeching of tires, people screaming... It's like I was right back there. And then the confusion at the camp, all those voices speaking different languages. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those memories?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived that. I'm here now, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that feeling?",
    "Client: I guess... it's like, yeah, it was awful. But I got through it. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought. It's just... it's hard to feel strong when I still get so anxious about everything, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that anxiety connect to these memories?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'm always waiting for the next disaster? Like, I survived the accident, made it to the camp, but then there was always another problem. So now, even here, I'm just... on edge. Expecting something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. How has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: God, in every way. I barely sleep. I'm always checking locks, looking over my shoulder. And school... I mean, I'm trying, but it's hard to focus when you're always in fight-or-flight mode, you know? And then there's the drinking...",
    "Therapist: Tell me more about that.",
    "Client: It's... it's not good, I know. But sometimes it feels like the only way to quiet my mind. To forget, even for a little while. But then I feel guilty, and more anxious, and it just... it becomes this cycle.",
    "Therapist: How do you think addressing these memories might impact that cycle?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe if I can process this stuff, really deal with it, I won't need to drink to forget? But it's scary. Facing it all head-on like this... it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: Your courage in doing so is commendable. What's motivating you?",
    "Client: I want my life back, you know? I want to be able to walk down the street without panicking. To sleep through the night. To feel... normal again. And I know the drinking isn't helping. It's just... it's all I've known for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How do you feel you're progressing?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to tell sometimes. Days like today, when we do these exposures, I feel like I'm right back at square one. But then... I don't know. Maybe I'm handling it a little better each time? It's still overwhelming, but... maybe a little less so?",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What strategies have been helpful?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises help. And... and trying to ground myself, you know? Reminding myself where I am, that I'm safe now. It doesn't always work, but... it's something. And talking about it like this, afterwards... it helps put things in perspective.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent tools. How can we build on them?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I need to practice them more? Like, not just during our sessions, but in my daily life too? And... and maybe I need to be kinder to myself. It's hard, but... I'm trying, right? That has to count for something.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary. Really scary. But... I think it's helping. Slowly, but... yeah. I want to keep going. I have to, right? For myself. For my future. I just... I hope it gets easier.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. What's one thing you'll focus on this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll try to use those grounding techniques when I feel the urge to drink. See if I can ride out the craving without giving in. It's going to be tough, but... I want to try. I need to try.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. Remember, small steps matter. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... intense. But good, I think. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who really listens, you know?"
