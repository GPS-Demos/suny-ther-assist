    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. I'm feeling a bit anxious already, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my old bedroom. It's dark, and I can hear footsteps coming down the hall. My heart is racing. I know it's him... my uncle. I'm frozen in bed, pretending to be asleep.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. My palms are sweaty, and I can barely breathe. I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's... he's in the room now. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. He's sitting on the edge of my bed, and I'm trying so hard not to shake. His hand... his hand is on my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Disgusted. Angry. I want to push him away, but I'm too scared. My whole body is tense. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I'll try. He's... he's touching me now. I feel so helpless, so small. I'm silently begging for someone to come in and stop this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm dissociating. It's like I'm floating above my body, watching it happen. I feel numb, detached. But underneath, there's this overwhelming shame and fear.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still a 9, but... it feels different. Less intense somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back in my body now. He's leaving the room. I feel dirty, used. I want to scrub my skin off. There's this hollow feeling in my chest.",

    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's end the exercise here. You did very well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing this work.",
    "Therapist: You should be. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we wrap up."
