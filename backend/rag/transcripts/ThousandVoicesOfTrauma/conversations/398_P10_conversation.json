    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's been years since I've really talked about the crash.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm boarding the plane. It's a small commercial flight, maybe 50 passengers. The air is humid, and I can smell jet fuel. My uniform feels stiff, freshly pressed. I take my seat near the front, 3A.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're taxiing down the runway. The engines are roaring, and I feel that familiar push as we take off. Everything seems normal at first. I'm... I'm leafing through a magazine, not really paying attention.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's starting to race a bit. I'm at about a 4 on the SUDS scale.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... We're about 20 minutes into the flight when I hear a loud bang. The plane shudders violently. People start screaming. I... I can see smoke trailing from the left engine through my window. Oh God, the fear is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Carlos. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling with mine, trying to stay calm. But inside, I'm panicking. The plane is losing altitude fast. We're plummeting towards the ground. I can hear the pilot on the intercom, but I can't make out what he's saying over the noise.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. We're still falling. People are praying, crying. I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. The ground is getting closer. I can see trees, a field. We're going to crash. Oh God, we're going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: The impact is... it's violent. Metal tearing, glass shattering. My body slams forward against the seatbelt. Pain explodes in my chest, my head. Everything's a blur of motion and noise. Then... silence. Just the crackle of flames and people moaning.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I unbuckle my seatbelt. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely manage it. Smoke is filling the cabin. I need to get out. I stumble to my feet, coughing. There's a hole in the side of the plane. I make my way towards it, trying not to look at the bodies around me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Guilty. Why am I alive when others aren't? My SUDS is still high, maybe a 9.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: I squeeze through the opening. The heat from the flames is intense. I fall to the ground outside, gasping for air. My legs feel weak, but I force myself to crawl away from the wreckage. I can hear screams behind me, but I... I can't bring myself to go back. I just lie there in the grass, shaking, watching the plane burn.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I lay there. Eventually, I hear sirens. Paramedics find me. They're asking questions, but I can barely speak. I'm in shock. They load me into an ambulance. As we drive away, I can't stop looking back at the smoke rising from the crash site.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I should have helped others. Why didn't I go back? I'm a coward. Those people... they needed help, and I just ran.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were in shock. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. But I still feel so guilty.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything's a blur. Tests, questions, more tests. I keep seeing flashes of the crash. The faces of the other passengers. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I'm back on that plane. The doctors say I'm lucky to be alive, but I don't feel lucky. I feel... hollow.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. What happens in the days after?",
    "Client: I'm released from the hospital, but I can't go home. I stay in a hotel near the airport. The news is full of reports about the crash. They're calling it a miracle that anyone survived. But it doesn't feel like a miracle. I... I start drinking. Anything to numb the memories, the guilt.",
    "Therapist: How does that affect you?",
    "Client: It makes things worse. I have nightmares. Vivid ones. I wake up screaming, drenched in sweat. The hotel staff checks on me a few times. I'm embarrassed, ashamed. I can't face going back to work. How can I fly again after this?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 6. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. Keep going.",
    "Client: I eventually go back home. My family is supportive, but they don't understand. How could they? I push them away. I can't stand the pitying looks, the constant questions about how I'm doing. I'm not doing well. I'm barely functioning.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope?",
    "Client: I don't, not really. I go through the motions. I see a therapist, but I can't open up. I'm angry all the time. At myself, at the airline, at the world. I start getting panic attacks when I hear planes overhead. I can't even drive past the airport without breaking into a cold sweat.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. What about your work?",
    "Client: I... I can't go back. The thought of getting on a plane again... it paralyzes me. I take a leave of absence, but deep down, I know I'll never fly again. It feels like my whole identity has been stripped away. Who am I if I'm not a pilot?",
    "Therapist: That's a big change. How do you handle it?",
    "Client: Poorly. I start isolating myself. My marriage falls apart. My wife... she tries to understand, but I push her away. I can't be the person I was before the crash. I feel like I died on that plane, and this... this shell is all that's left.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5. Talking about it... it still hurts, but it's not as raw.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The next few years are a blur. I go through the motions of living, but I'm not really there. I drift from job to job, nothing feels right. The anniversary of the crash is always the hardest. Every year, I relive it. The nightmares get worse. I start avoiding anything that reminds me of flying.",
    "Therapist: How does that impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it limits everything. I can't travel. I miss family events because I can't get on a plane. I feel like a prisoner in my own fear. I know it's irrational, but I can't shake the feeling that if I fly again, something terrible will happen.",
    "Therapist: That's a common fear after such an experience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Tired of being afraid. Tired of letting this control my life. That's why I'm here. I want to move past this, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step, recognizing that. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4 now. Talking about it... it's not easy, but it feels like I'm finally facing it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Carlos. How do you feel about what we've discussed today?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming, but also a relief. I've never talked about it in this much detail before. It's like... like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to put it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a great analogy. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to start moving forward. It's scary, but I can't keep living in fear of the past.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way through this.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic, Carlos. We'll pick up here next session."
