    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. So, we were talking about the airplane crash... It was supposed to be a routine flight to visit my grandchildren. I remember boarding the plane, finding my seat, and settling in. Everything seemed normal at first. The flight attendants were going through their safety demonstrations, and I was half-listening while looking out the window.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the plane started shaking violently. People were screaming, and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. I fumbled with mine, my hands shaking so badly I could barely get it on. The fear was overwhelming... I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Right, thank you. As I was saying, the plane was plummeting. I could see the ground getting closer through the window. I thought about my family, my grandchildren... I was convinced I was going to die. The impact was deafening. Metal screeching, people crying out... I was thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: After the initial impact, there was an eerie silence for a moment. Then, chaos erupted. People were scrambling to get out. Smoke was filling the cabin. I was disoriented, my head throbbing from hitting the seat in front of me. I unbuckled my seatbelt, but my legs felt like jelly. I could barely stand.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I stumbled towards the emergency exit. The flight attendant was there, urging people to move quickly. The smell of fuel was strong, and I was terrified the plane might explode. As I reached the exit, I hesitated. The drop to the ground seemed so far... But I knew I had to jump. I closed my eyes and leapt. The impact with the ground knocked the wind out of me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're very brave.",
    "Client: It was. I lay there for a moment, gasping for air. Around me, other passengers were landing, some crying out in pain. I forced myself to get up and move away from the plane. My whole body ached, but adrenaline kept me going. I remember looking back at the wreckage, the reality of what had just happened hitting me. I... I started sobbing uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's still so vivid. The aftermath was a blur of sirens, emergency responders, and shocked faces. I was eventually taken to a hospital. The physical injuries healed, but the fear... the nightmares... they've stayed with me. Every time I hear a plane overhead, my heart races. I can't even consider flying again. It's like I'm trapped, unable to visit my family without reliving that terror.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaken, but... oddly, a bit lighter? Talking about it is hard, but I think it helps. I just wish I could move past this fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It's been so long since I've allowed myself to really think about that day. Part of me has been afraid that if I let those memories in, they'll overwhelm me completely. But being here, talking it through... it's difficult, but not as impossible as I feared.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Remember, healing takes time.",
    "Client: You're right. I know it's a process. Sometimes I feel guilty for struggling so much when others had it worse. Some people didn't survive the crash, and here I am, alive but unable to board a plane. It feels selfish somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Everyone processes trauma differently.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just hard not to compare. But focusing on the crash itself, I remember the moments right after I got out of the plane. The grass was wet with dew, and I remember thinking how strange it was to notice that in the middle of such chaos. It was like my brain was trying to latch onto any normal detail it could find.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction in traumatic situations.",
    "Client: Is it? That's somewhat comforting to know. After that, I remember sitting on the ground, watching as firefighters battled the flames engulfing part of the plane. The heat was intense, even from where I was sitting. I kept thinking about the people who might still be inside, feeling helpless that I couldn't do anything to help them.",
    "Therapist: You've recalled a lot. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, to be honest. Reliving it all is draining. But there's also a sense of... I'm not sure, maybe relief? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down, even if just for a moment. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's often part of the healing process.",
    "Client: That's good to hear. I think... I think I'd like to stop for today, if that's okay. It feels like a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I'm looking forward to the day when I can think about flying without panic setting in. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: With continued work, absolutely. You're making great strides.",
    "Client: That gives me hope. Thank you again for today. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. Remember to use your coping strategies if needed."
