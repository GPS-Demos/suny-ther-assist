    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Uh, honestly? I'm pretty nervous. I mean, I know we've talked about it before, but the idea of reliving those experiences... it's not exactly something I'm looking forward to. Can you remind me why we're doing this again?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's to reduce PTSD symptoms. Any specific concerns?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I'm worried about how intense it might be. Like, what if I completely lose it during the session? And also, I'm not sure how talking about being cyberbullied is going to help me deal with my past experiences of neglect. It seems... I don't know, disconnected somehow.",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. We'll go at your pace. How do you see the connection?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose both experiences made me feel pretty worthless and alone. When I was younger, my parents were always too busy with work to pay attention to me. And then later, when I started college and was trying to make friends online, I ended up being targeted by this group of trolls who seemed to make it their mission to tear me down. It's like I can never escape feeling unwanted or attacked, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. Maybe... maybe it could help me see those experiences from a different perspective? Or maybe it could help me process some of the emotions I've been bottling up? I don't know, it's just a guess.",
    "Therapist: Good insights. What do you hope to gain today?",
    "Client: I guess I'm hoping to find some way to not let these experiences control me anymore. It'd be nice to be able to use social media without constantly worrying about being attacked, or to not feel like I'm unworthy of attention or care from others. But I'm also scared of what might come up during the session. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll take it slow. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you walk me through what exactly we're going to do? And what should I do if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. If overwhelmed, we'll pause. Okay?",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds manageable. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I guess if it gets too intense, I can always ask for a break, right? Is there anything specific I should focus on while we're doing this?",
    "Therapist: Focus on your feelings and sensations. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Alright, I'll try to keep that in mind. It's strange, I can already feel my heart starting to race a bit just thinking about it. But I'm here, I'm safe, and this is to help me get better. I think I'm ready to start whenever you are.",
    "Therapist: Great. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath."
