    "Therapist: Welcome, Aisha. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving those moments... it's terrifying. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is understandable. This process can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in healing.",
    "Client: I get that, but... what if I completely fall apart? I have responsibilities at home and work. I can't afford to break down.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. Can you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing exactly? I mean, I know we've talked about it before, but now that we're here, I'm feeling a bit lost.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the traumatic memory in a safe environment. It helps process the event.",
    "Client: Revisit it? Like, describe it out loud? That seems... intense. Will you be guiding me through it somehow?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. We'll focus on details, emotions, and thoughts during the event.",
    "Client: I see. And what if I start panicking? Or if I can't continue? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed and not being able to stop the memories once they start.",
    "Therapist: If that happens, we'll use grounding techniques. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I guess I'm also wondering... will this actually help? I've been carrying this for so long, it feels like a part of me now.",
    "Therapist: Many find it reduces PTSD symptoms over time. It's about facing fears to overcome them.",
    "Client: I understand. It's just... hard to imagine feeling better. But I trust you, and I'm willing to try. I want to be better for my family, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yes. I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Can you just... can you hold my hand when we start? I know it sounds childish, but I think it would help me feel grounded.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start slowly. Focus on your breathing first."
