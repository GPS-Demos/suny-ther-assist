    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also frozen at the same time. The memory of that hurricane, it's just so vivid now. I can still hear the wind howling, feel the house shaking. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart is pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless we all were, just huddled in the basement, praying the roof wouldn't blow off.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Where in your body do you feel that fear most intensely?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my stomach. Like a knot that's twisting tighter and tighter. And my hands are shaking a bit. I didn't even realize until just now. It's strange how our bodies remember these things, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"We're not safe. It could happen again.\" And then I feel guilty because we survived when so many others didn't. I see the faces of our neighbors who lost everything. I wonder if I could have done more to help them afterwards.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess they're always there, lurking in the background. Every time there's a storm forecast, I start to panic. I obsessively check the weather, stock up on supplies. My husband thinks I'm overreacting, but I can't help it. It's like I'm always waiting for the next disaster to strike.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these memories now compared to immediately after the hurricane?",
    "Client: Hmm... That's a good question. I think... I think I'm less paralyzed by them now. Before, I could barely function. I'd have these flashbacks and just shut down completely. Now, it's still hard, but I can at least talk about it without completely falling apart. But the anxiety, it's still there. It's like a constant companion.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: Mixed, I suppose. Part of me is proud that I can face these memories without completely breaking down. But another part of me is frustrated. I thought by now I'd be... I don't know, \"over it\"? That sounds silly when I say it out loud. I guess I'm realizing recovery isn't linear.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. I mean, here I am, voluntarily reliving one of the worst experiences of my life. That takes guts, right? And I'm still standing. I'm still here, still fighting. I never thought I had that kind of resilience in me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you use that strength moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I could be more proactive in my recovery. Maybe instead of just reacting to my anxiety, I could challenge it more. Face my fears head-on, you know? Like, maybe I could start volunteering with disaster relief efforts. Turn this awful experience into something positive. It's scary to think about, but if I can survive reliving the hurricane in these sessions, maybe I can do that too.",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up as you consider that possibility?",
    "Client: It's a mix. There's fear, definitely. The idea of purposely putting myself in situations that remind me of the hurricane is terrifying. But there's also... hope? And a little excitement, even. Like maybe I could reclaim some of the power that the hurricane took from me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this shift in perspective feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, I think. Like I'm not just a victim anymore. I mean, I'll always carry this experience with me, but maybe it doesn't have to define me. Maybe I can use it to help others, to make a difference. It's still scary, but it's a different kind of scary. More like a challenge than a threat, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like a weight has been lifted. Don't get me wrong, the memory is still painful, and I know I have a long way to go. But for the first time in a while, I feel like I can see a path forward. It's not clear, and I'm sure it won't be easy, but it's there. And that... that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to carry this feeling forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to write it down. These feelings, these realizations. So when I'm having a bad day, I can look back and remember that there's hope, that I'm making progress. And maybe... maybe I could start looking into those volunteer opportunities we talked about. Take small steps towards facing my fears. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like I've done something important, you know? It's exhausting, facing these memories, but I also feel stronger for having done it. And I'm grateful, honestly. For this space to process everything, for your guidance. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... I don't know, maybe a little excited? Like I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water.",
