    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise focusing on the car accident. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us to that day.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. It's a sunny afternoon. I'm driving home from my shop. The radio's playing softly... I remember feeling content, thinking about dinner plans with my spouse.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... the familiar stretch of highway. Trees lining the road. Not much traffic. I'm in the left lane, cruise control set.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: (voice trembling slightly) Suddenly, there's a car swerving into my lane. It's... it's coming so fast. My heart starts racing. I... I try to brake, but there's not enough time.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My hands are gripping the steering wheel so tight. I can feel my palms getting sweaty. I... I think I yelled something.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Okay... The impact. God, the impact. It's like... like being hit by a freight train. There's this deafening crash, and I'm jerked forward. The airbag deploys, and it feels like I've been punched in the face.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I smell burning rubber. My ears are ringing. Everything's a blur of motion and then... stillness. Just... eerie stillness.",
    "Therapist: What are you aware of in that moment?",
    "Client: Pain. So much pain. My chest hurts from the seatbelt. I taste blood in my mouth. And... and I'm scared. I'm so scared I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I hear people shouting. Someone's at my window, asking if I'm okay. But I can't respond. I'm just... frozen. Staring at the crumpled hood of my car.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. This can't be real.\" And then... then I start worrying about my spouse. What if I don't make it home? What if...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but their voices sound far away. They're cutting away my seatbelt, and the movement sends sharp pains through my body. I... I start to cry. I'm embarrassed, but I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I... I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. (voice shaking)",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Focus on my voice. You're in my office, not in that car.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: (after a pause) They're... they're getting me out of the car now. Every movement hurts. I'm on a stretcher, and I can see my car. It's... it's so mangled. I can't believe I survived that.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you see your car?",
    "Client: Shock. Disbelief. And... and this overwhelming sense of vulnerability. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're loading me into the ambulance. The sirens are so loud. I... I keep asking about the other driver, but no one's answering me. I'm scared for them, but also... also angry. Why were they driving like that?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: They're... they're asking me questions. My name, the date. I answer, but it feels like someone else is talking. My body's there, but my mind... it's like I'm floating above, watching it all happen.",
    "Therapist: That's dissociation. It's a common response to trauma. How does it feel to recall that?",
    "Client: It's... it's unsettling. Like I'm losing control all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take another deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) We're... we're arriving at the hospital now. It's chaos. Bright lights, people rushing around. I'm wheeled into the ER, and there's so much activity. Doctors, nurses... everyone's talking at once.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared. I... I keep thinking about my spouse. I want them here, but I'm also glad they don't have to see me like this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens next?",
    "Client: Tests. So many tests. X-rays, CT scans. I'm in pain, but they've given me something for it. It's... it's making everything fuzzy. I drift in and out of consciousness.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those moments of awareness. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The beeping of machines. The antiseptic smell. Nurses checking on me. And... and this constant replay of the accident in my head. I can't stop seeing that car coming at me.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How does it feel to remember that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's racing again. I feel... I feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I wake up in a hospital room. It's dark outside. My spouse is there, holding my hand. They look so worried, and I feel guilty for putting them through this.",
    "Therapist: What do you say to them?",
    "Client: I... I try to smile. Tell them I'm okay. But my voice breaks, and suddenly I'm crying. All the fear, the pain... it all comes rushing out.",
    "Therapist: How does your spouse respond?",
    "Client: They... they just hold me. Tell me it's okay, that I'm safe now. But I don't feel safe. I feel like everything's changed.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How does it feel to recall that moment now?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm grateful for my spouse's support, but... but I also feel this deep sadness. Like something was lost that day.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that feeling of loss?",
    "Client: It's... it's like my sense of security was shattered. I used to feel invincible, you know? Like bad things happened to other people. But now... now I know how fragile life is.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How has it affected you?",
    "Client: I... I've become more cautious. Anxious. Especially when driving. Sometimes I... I have these moments where I'm sure another accident is about to happen.",
    "Therapist: Those are common symptoms of PTSD. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also... also a bit lighter? Like talking about it has released some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's start wrapping up. Can you bring yourself back to the present?",
    "Client: (opens eyes slowly) Yeah... yeah, I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Harder than I expected. But... but I think it was good. Necessary.",
    "Therapist: I agree. You did excellent work today. Let's take a few moments to debrief..."
