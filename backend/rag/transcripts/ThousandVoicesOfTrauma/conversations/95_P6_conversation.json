    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about it makes me a little anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: I'm in the hospital room. The beeping of the machines is so loud. I can smell the antiseptic... it's overwhelming. The doctor comes in with a serious look on his face. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: He tells me they found something on my scan. A mass. I feel like the room is spinning. My mouth goes dry, and I can't seem to catch my breath. It's like everything is moving in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My palms are sweating, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor is explaining treatment options, but I can barely hear him over the ringing in my ears. I'm thinking about my studies, my future... everything feels so uncertain now. I want to run away, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm reliving that fear... that helplessness. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I... I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... The nurse comes in. She looks at me with pity, and I hate it. I don't want to be the sick girl. I want my normal life back. I'm angry and scared and... lost.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel the scratchy hospital gown on my skin. The fluorescent lights are so harsh... everything feels too bright, too loud. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. But it feels different now. Less panicky, more... sad.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm thinking about telling my parents. How do I even begin that conversation? I'm supposed to be starting my career, not fighting for my life. It's not fair. None of this is fair.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense. I can feel this heaviness in my chest. But... I also feel a little calmer? Like, I'm sad but not as panicked.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Maybe a 6 now? It's still intense, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Continue.",
    "Client: I remember looking out the window, seeing people going about their day. I felt so disconnected from everything. But there was also this strange sense of clarity. Like, suddenly I knew what really mattered in life.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: Bittersweet, I guess. Scary, but also... grounding? My heart isn't racing as much now.",
    "Therapist: Your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's wrap up.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* Wow, that was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's common. We'll process this next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could face that memory, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll end here for today."
