    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about the cult experiences brings up a lot of mixed emotions. Part of me wants to get it out, but another part is hesitant.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the compound. It's early morning, the sun's just rising. The air is crisp, and there's dew on the grass. I'm standing outside the main building, my heart racing. I can smell coffee brewing from somewhere nearby.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader, he... he comes out. He's wearing his usual white robe, looking so serene. But his eyes... they're cold. He announces we're having a special ceremony today. My stomach drops. I know what that means.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Amir?",
    "Client: Anxious. My palms are sweating just thinking about it. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 70?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Right. So, we all gather in the main hall. The air is thick with incense, and everyone's chanting. I... I see my wife across the room. She looks scared. I want to go to her, but I can't move. The leader starts talking about purification and sacrifice. My heart's pounding so hard I can barely hear him.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Absolute terror. I know something bad is going to happen, but I feel powerless to stop it. It's like... like I'm trapped in my own body.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: *nods* Okay. The leader... he calls my wife forward. She's shaking as she walks up. I want to scream, to run to her, but I'm frozen. He hands her a cup, says it's for the \"ultimate cleansing.\" I know it's poison. I... I can't... *starts breathing heavily*",
    "Therapist: Take a moment, Amir. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *follows breathing* Thanks. I... I can continue.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're in control. What happens next?",
    "Client: My wife, she... she looks at me. Her eyes are pleading. I want to save her, but I'm too scared. The leader puts his hand on her shoulder, urging her to drink. She... she does it. Oh God, she drinks it. *voice breaking* I watch her collapse. People are cheering, but all I hear is silence. I've failed her. I've failed her...",
    "Therapist: Stay with us, Amir. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *wiping tears* I'm... I'm here. It's just... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Guilty. So incredibly guilty. And angry. At myself, at the leader, at everyone there.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid, Amir. What happens after your wife collapses?",
    "Client: Chaos. Some people are crying, others are still cheering. The leader is smiling, saying she's been \"purified.\" I finally break free from my paralysis and run to her. But it's too late. She's... she's gone. I hold her, screaming, begging her to wake up. But she doesn't. She never will again.",
    "Therapist: Take a breath, Amir. You're doing well.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* It's hard... but I'm okay. I can continue.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. But I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I snap. All the fear turns to rage. I lunge at the leader, screaming. But his followers grab me, hold me back. He just stands there, smiling that serene smile. Says I'll \"understand in time.\" I'm dragged away, locked in a room. I can hear more \"ceremonies\" happening. More people dying. I'm powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Amir. This is in the past.",
    "Client: I know, I know. But it feels so real. I spent days in that room, hearing screams, smelling death. I... I thought I was going to die there too.",
    "Therapist: How did you get out?",
    "Client: Someone... someone finally called the police. I don't know who. Maybe a family member of one of the victims. I remember hearing sirens, shouting. The door burst open, and there was a police officer. I was so weak, so disoriented. They had to carry me out.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Relieved, but... hollow. Like I've relived it all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Amir. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard, but I think it helps. Talking about it, I mean.",
    "Therapist: It does. You're processing the trauma. Is there anything else you want to share about that day?",
    "Client: I... I remember the hospital. The lights were so bright after being in that dark room. Doctors and nurses everywhere. Police asking questions. But all I could think about was my wife. How I couldn't save her. How I let her down.",
    "Therapist: Those thoughts are common in trauma survivors, Amir.",
    "Client: I know that now, but... it still hurts. I see her face every night when I close my eyes. Sometimes I wake up thinking I'm still there, in that compound.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those moments?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself I'm safe now. I look at photos of my family, my kids. It helps ground me. But sometimes the guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that you were a victim too, Amir.",
    "Client: *sighs* I know. Logically, I know. But emotionally... it's harder to accept.",
    "Therapist: That's what we're working on. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy weight, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's progress, Amir. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: It is. You're showing great courage. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I'm exhausted, but in a... a good way? If that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'm here to support you. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I'm actually looking forward to it. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Take care, Amir.",
    "Client: Thank you. You too."
