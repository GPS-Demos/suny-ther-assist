    "Therapist: Welcome, Maia. Let's begin our session. Can you describe the combat experience we've been working on?",
    "Client: Yes, I can. It was during my second tour in Afghanistan. We were on a routine patrol near a small village when suddenly... (pauses, takes a deep breath) I'm sorry, it's still difficult to talk about.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take your time.",
    "Client: Thank you. We were ambushed. The sound of gunfire was deafening. I remember the smell of dust and gunpowder in the air. My heart was racing, and I felt frozen for a moment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I saw my teammate, Jake, get hit. He fell right next to me, and there was so much blood. I wanted to help him, but we were pinned down. I felt so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to drag Jake behind some cover. His eyes were wide with fear, and he was gasping for air. I tried to stop the bleeding, but my hands were shaking so much. I kept telling him, \"Stay with me, Jake. You're going to be okay.\" But I wasn't sure if I believed it myself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. My mouth was dry, and I felt nauseous. The adrenaline was coursing through me, but at the same time, I felt this overwhelming sense of dread.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The firefight seemed to last forever. I could hear my other teammates shouting and returning fire. The air was thick with smoke and the sound of bullets whizzing past. I kept pressure on Jake's wound, praying for the medevac to arrive.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: When the helicopter finally came, I felt a mix of relief and terror. We had to move Jake, and every time we shifted him, he cried out in pain. I felt like I was hurting him more, even though I was trying to save him.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: As we loaded him onto the helicopter, I caught a glimpse of his face. He looked so pale and weak. I wanted to go with him, but I had to stay with my unit. Watching that helicopter fly away was one of the hardest things I've ever done.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Reliving it is exhausting. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally facing it instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, though. Sometimes I wonder if I could have done more, you know? If I had reacted faster or done something differently, maybe Jake wouldn't have been hit.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Remember, you did your best.",
    "Client: I know, logically. But emotionally, it's still a struggle. The guilt, the what-ifs... they don't just go away. And sometimes, I feel angry too. Angry at the situation, at the war, at myself.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. It's part of processing trauma.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... hard to reconcile. Being back home now, everything seems so normal. But inside, I still carry that day with me. It's like I'm living in two worlds sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're not alone in this.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that others go through this too. I just want to feel... whole again, you know? Like I'm not constantly on edge or reliving those moments.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll work towards that together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's a long road, but I'm committed to this process. I want to honor Jake's memory by living my life fully, not being trapped in that moment forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel like I am, even if it's slow. Some days are harder than others, but overall, I think I'm moving in the right direction. It's just... it's a lot to process, you know?",
    "Therapist: It is. But you're handling it well. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I feel like we made some progress. Thank you for your support and guidance.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maia. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
