    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting the earthquake... it's unsettling. I've spent so much time trying to forget it all. And with my recent breakup, I'm not sure I have the emotional strength for this right now.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is completely normal. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about how intense the memories might be. What if I completely fall apart? And I'm not sure how this will help me move past the trauma. It feels counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Imaginal exposure helps process the trauma. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: I guess it makes sense, but it's still scary. I've been having more nightmares lately, especially since Sarah left. I'm afraid this might make them worse. And what if I can't handle it? What if I freeze up or have a panic attack?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will we be doing this? And what exactly am I supposed to do? Just... talk about what happened? I'm not sure I remember all the details clearly. Some parts are vivid, but others are a blur. And honestly, I'm embarrassed about how I reacted during the earthquake. I wasn't as brave or helpful as I should have been.",
    "Therapist: We'll spend about 30-45 minutes on the exposure. You'll describe the event in detail, in present tense. It's okay if some parts are unclear.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as bad as I thought. But still, 45 minutes is a long time to be talking about something so distressing. What if I get overwhelmed? And what about after the session? I'm worried about how I'll feel when I leave here.",
    "Therapist: You can pause anytime. We have grounding techniques if needed. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm just trying to prepare myself as much as possible. It's hard to imagine willingly putting myself through this, but I trust you. And I know I can't keep avoiding it forever. My anxiety has been getting worse, and I'm tired of feeling stuck.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to face this shows incredible courage. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this will help me finally move forward. I've been stuck in this limbo for so long, especially since the breakup. It feels like everything is connected - the trauma from the earthquake, my anxiety, the failed relationship. I'm ready to try anything that might help me break free from this cycle.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Let's start. Remember, you're safe here."
