    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see those images, you know? The cramped room, the faces of the other girls... It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold grip around my chest. I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. I keep expecting someone to burst through that door and... and...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) Thanks. It's just... when I close my eyes, I'm right back there. I can smell the musty air, hear the muffled sobs. God, I feel so helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this happen to me? I was just a kid, you know? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because... because it shouldn't happen to anyone. But I can't help wondering if I could have done something differently, if I could have fought harder or...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are so tight they're almost up to my ears. And my stomach... it's like there's a rock sitting in it. I feel nauseous, but also kind of... hollow? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. Can you describe more about that hollow feeling?",
    "Client: It's like... like there's this emptiness inside me. Where there should be hope or joy or... I don't know, anything positive, there's just this void. And it scares me. What if I never feel whole again? What if I'm always carrying this... this black hole inside me?",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How do they relate to your trauma experience?",
    "Client: I guess... I feel like those men took something from me that I can never get back. My innocence, my trust in the world. And now, even years later, I'm still letting them take things from me. My peace of mind, my ability to feel safe... It's like they're still winning, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear your frustration. What would it mean to you to \"win\" instead?",
    "Client: (long pause) I... I've never really thought about it that way. Winning... I suppose it would mean living my life on my own terms. Not letting the fear control me. Being able to trust people again, to form meaningful relationships without always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It would mean... freedom, I guess. Real freedom, not just physical freedom.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. How does thinking about that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... conflicting. Part of me feels hopeful, like maybe there's a light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. But another part feels overwhelmed. It seems so far away, you know? Like climbing Mount Everest with no equipment. And then there's this voice in my head saying I don't deserve it anyway, that I'm damaged goods...",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult thoughts. Where do you think they come from?",
    "Client: (sighs) Probably from all the things they used to tell us. That we were worthless, that no one would ever want us, that we should be grateful they were giving us a purpose. And even though I know logically that it's all lies, emotionally... it's like those words are tattooed on my soul.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize those thoughts as their words, not your truth?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, in a way. Like, for the first time, I can see those thoughts for what they are - just more chains they tried to bind me with. But it's also terrifying because if those aren't my thoughts, then who am I really? What's left when I strip away all the layers of trauma and fear?",
    "Therapist: That's a profound question. What do you hope is underneath?",
    "Client: I... I hope there's strength. I mean, I survived, right? That has to count for something. And maybe... maybe there's still that little girl who used to dream big, who believed in goodness and hope. I'd like to think she's still in there somewhere, just waiting for it to be safe to come out again.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful thought. How does connecting with that part of yourself feel?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet. There's a warmth there, like reconnecting with an old friend. But there's also this deep sadness, this grief for all the years lost, all the experiences that little girl should have had. And I'm scared... what if I can't protect her this time either?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. What might help you feel more capable of protecting her?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe learning to trust my instincts again? They were right back then, you know. I knew something was wrong, but I ignored that feeling. And maybe... maybe learning to ask for help. I've been trying to do this all on my own for so long, and it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like important steps. How does talking about this now compare to the start of our session?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. I still feel shaky and raw, but there's also this tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought I was. It's terrifying and exciting at the same time. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many find this process both challenging and liberating.",
    "Client: Yeah, that's exactly it. Liberating. It's like... for the first time in forever, I can see a future that isn't completely defined by my past. Don't get me wrong, I'm still scared out of my mind, but... but maybe that's okay. Maybe I don't have to have it all figured out right now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this new feeling, this spark of hope, without trying to analyze it or figure out what comes next. Just... just be present in this moment where anything feels possible. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment together."
