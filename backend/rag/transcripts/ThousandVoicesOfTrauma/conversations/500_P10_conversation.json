    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. We're diving into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure how I'll handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach's a bit knotted up.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking down the street. It's a sunny afternoon, but I don't feel the warmth. There's this tension in the air. I see a group of protesters up ahead, signs held high. They're chanting something about justice.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The crowd is diverse. Young, old, different races. But there's a line of police officers facing them. They're in full riot gear. It's... it's intimidating.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing a bit. I feel... conflicted. Part of me wants to join the protest, but I'm also scared.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Just observe those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I decide to move closer. The chanting gets louder. \"No justice, no peace!\" Someone hands me a sign. I take it, feeling a surge of... I don't know, solidarity?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up. Maybe a 55? I'm getting more anxious as I remember.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing. What do you see happening?",
    "Client: There's a sudden shift in the crowd. People start pushing forward. The police line tenses up. I hear someone shout, \"They're coming!\" And then... oh God...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's happening?",
    "Client: The police... they start advancing. There's a loud bang - tear gas, I think. People are screaming, running. I'm frozen, I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My eyes are burning. I can't breathe properly. There's chaos all around me. I see a young woman fall nearby. I want to help her, but...",
    "Therapist: But what?",
    "Client: An officer grabs me. He's shouting something, but I can't understand. I'm pushed to the ground. Hard. My face scrapes against the pavement.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. My heart's pounding. I can almost feel the concrete against my cheek.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm being handcuffed. It's too tight, cutting into my wrists. I try to tell them I wasn't doing anything wrong, but no one's listening. I see boots all around me. Someone's knee is on my back.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. Scared. I... I can't believe this is happening to me. I'm a professional, I've never been in trouble before. But now I'm being treated like a criminal.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about my family. What if I don't make it home? What if this goes on my record? Will I lose my job? It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm pulled to my feet. My shoulders hurt from the awkward position. They're leading me to a police van. I see others being roughly handled too. There's a young man, he can't be more than 20, blood running down his face.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing that affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel sick. Angry. I want to help him, but I can't. I feel... powerless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens in the van?",
    "Client: It's cramped. Hot. We're packed in like sardines. Someone's crying. I can still hear the chaos outside. The van starts moving, and I lose my balance, falling against the others.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My wrists are burning from the handcuffs. My face stings where it scraped the ground. I'm sweating, heart racing. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: And emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Angry. Confused. How did a peaceful protest turn into this? I keep thinking about my wife, my kids. Will they know where I am?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens when you arrive at the station?",
    "Client: It's a blur of fluorescent lights and shouting. We're herded out of the van. I see rows of people sitting on the floor, hands still cuffed. Some are injured. I'm told to sit. No one will tell us what's going on.",
    "Therapist: How long are you there?",
    "Client: Hours. It feels like days. My back aches from sitting on the hard floor. They finally start processing us. Fingerprints, mug shots. I've never felt so... dehumanized.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying everything. Wondering if I could have done something differently. Feeling angry at the police, at the system. Scared about what this means for my future.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: After what feels like forever, they tell me I'm being released. No charges, they say. Like it's nothing. Like they didn't just turn my world upside down.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: Relief, at first. But then... anger. Frustration. I see others still waiting, some injured. I feel guilty for leaving them behind.",
    "Therapist: What do you do when you get out?",
    "Client: I... I break down. Right there on the street. All the emotions I've been holding in just come flooding out. I'm crying, shaking. A stranger asks if I'm okay, but I can't even speak.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I somehow make it home. My wife is frantic. She's been calling hospitals, police stations. When she sees me, she starts crying too. I can't even explain what happened. I just hold her.",
    "Therapist: How does being home affect your emotions?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Relief to be safe, but also this lingering fear. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was. I keep replaying everything in my mind.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 65? I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. How are you feeling about the exercise?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Bringing it all back like that. But also... I don't know, maybe a little cathartic? Like I'm starting to process it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Is there anything else you want to share before we start winding down?",
    "Client: I just... I keep thinking about how this has changed me. I used to trust authority, you know? Now I find myself getting anxious around police. Even seeing a uniform makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. We'll work on addressing those feelings. For now, let's focus on grounding yourself. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um, okay. I see... the clock on the wall, your bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the painting of the ocean, and the box of tissues on the table.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The leather of the couch, my wedding ring, the smooth surface of my watch, and the fabric of my shirt.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of coffee and... is that lavender? From an air freshener maybe?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The lingering mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit more... present. Grounded, I guess. My heart rate has slowed down.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 40, I'd say. Similar to when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today. Remember to use the grounding techniques we practiced if you feel overwhelmed later. Do you have any questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. It was tough, but... I feel like I'm making progress. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working on this in our next session. Take care of yourself this week."
