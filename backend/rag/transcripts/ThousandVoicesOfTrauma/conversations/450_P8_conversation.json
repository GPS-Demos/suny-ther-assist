    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. You know? I can still see those images, hear those voices... It's like I'm right back there, in that moment. My heart is pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how small I felt. How powerless. I was just a child, but I felt like I had to be an adult. I remember thinking, \"Why is this happening to me? What did I do wrong?\" And now, sitting here, I realize I've carried that feeling with me my whole life. Always wondering if I'm somehow to blame for the bad things that happen.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming. Sad, but also a little angry. I've spent so much of my life feeling guilty, feeling less than. And it wasn't my fault. I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard to shake that feeling, you know? I'm 65 years old, and I'm still that scared little girl sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your emotions right now?",
    "Client: There's this... heaviness. Like a weight on my chest. But also, strangely, a bit of relief? It's like... by facing this memory, I'm finally acknowledging how much it affected me. I've spent so long trying to push it down, pretend it didn't matter. But it did. It does. And maybe... maybe that's okay to admit?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to give yourself that permission?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I guess? But also terrifying. I've spent so long building these walls, you know? Protecting myself. And now it feels like they're crumbling. Part of me wants to run, to go back to numbing everything with alcohol. But another part... another part of me is tired of running. I want to face this, even if it's scary.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that part of you needs right now?",
    "Client: I... I think it needs to be heard. To be validated. For so long, I've felt like my experiences didn't matter. Like I didn't matter. Especially as a Latina woman, you know? There's this expectation to be strong, to just get over things. But I can't just get over this. I need... I need to process it. To grieve for that little girl who was hurt.",
    "Therapist: And how does it feel to acknowledge that need?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's sadness, definitely. But also... hope? Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to heal. To let go of some of this pain I've been carrying for so long. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that sense of hope?",
    "Client: I guess... it's the fact that I'm here, doing this work. For so long, I thought I was beyond help. That I was too old, too set in my ways to change. But being here, facing these memories... it's hard, but it's also showing me that I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe... maybe it's not too late for me to find some peace.",
    "Therapist: How does that strength feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth in my chest. Like a small flame. It's not huge, but it's there. And I think... I think it's growing. I can feel my shoulders relaxing a bit, my breathing getting easier. It's like... for the first time in a long time, I can see a future where I'm not constantly haunted by my past.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do with that growing strength?",
    "Client: I... I want to use it to keep moving forward. To face more of these memories, even though it's scary. I want to learn how to be kind to myself, to stop blaming myself for things that weren't my fault. And maybe... maybe I can use my experiences to help others. Other Latina women who've been through similar things. Show them that it's okay to seek help, that it's never too late to start healing.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea resonate with you?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like maybe there's a purpose to all this pain I've been through. I've always tried to be there for others, you know? But I've never really been able to be there for myself. Maybe... maybe by learning to do that, I can become even better at helping others. It's like... turning my pain into something positive.",
    "Therapist: What's the next step for you in this journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep doing this work. Keep facing these memories, no matter how hard it gets. And I want to start practicing self-compassion. To treat myself with the same kindness I'd show a friend going through this. It's not going to be easy, but... I'm ready. I'm tired of letting my past control my present. I want to take back control of my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful intention. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But it's a good kind of exhausted, you know? Like I've done something important. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for too long. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm on the right path. Thank you... for helping me get here.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today, Maria. Take care of yourself this week."
