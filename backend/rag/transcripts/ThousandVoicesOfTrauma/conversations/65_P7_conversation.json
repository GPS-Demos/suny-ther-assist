    "Therapist: Alright, Ahmad. Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the home invasion incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It was late at night, around 2 AM. I was studying for my exams when I heard a loud crash downstairs. At first, I thought maybe my dad had knocked something over, but then I heard unfamiliar voices. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I froze in my chair, unsure of what to do. The voices were getting louder, and I could hear heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. I wanted to call for help, but I was terrified they'd hear me. I just sat there, paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My hands were shaking so badly. I could hear them entering my parents' room first. There was shouting, and I heard my mom cry out. I felt so helpless, like I should be doing something to protect them, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: Then my door burst open. Two men in masks were there, holding guns. One of them grabbed me and threw me to the floor. I could smell alcohol on his breath. He kept asking where we kept our valuables, but I was too scared to speak.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is really hard. I can still feel the cold floor against my face, and the weight of his foot on my back. He was pressing the gun against my head, threatening to shoot if I didn't talk. I've never felt so terrified in my life.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I finally managed to stutter out that there was a safe in my parents' closet. They dragged me there, using me as a shield. My parents were tied up on the bed, looking at me with such fear. I felt like I had failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not there now. You're here, and you're safe.",
    "Client: They made me open the safe. My hands were shaking so badly, I could barely turn the dial. When it finally opened, they shoved me aside and started grabbing everything. I remember feeling relieved that the gun wasn't on me anymore, but then guilty for feeling that way.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions were normal. Continue.",
    "Client: After they left, we were all just... frozen. It took what felt like hours before anyone moved or spoke. I keep replaying that moment in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently, if I could have protected my family better.",
    "Therapist: You did the best you could in a terrifying situation.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but I still feel so weak. Ever since then, I've been jumpy, always checking locks, afraid to be alone in the house. It's like I'm constantly waiting for it to happen again.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're working through it.",
    "Client: Sometimes I have nightmares about it. I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I hear those footsteps again. It's affecting my studies, my relationships. I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: Trust takes time to rebuild. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... hard. I feel like I should be over it by now, you know? But every time I think about it, it's like I'm right back there, feeling just as helpless and scared as I was that night.",

    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This is more draining than I expected. Can we take a short break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today."
