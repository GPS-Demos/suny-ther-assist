    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit on edge, I suppose. Been thinking about what we might discuss today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say about a 40. Not terrible, but definitely feeling a bit jittery.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... yes, I think so. It's about the day my wife passed, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Yes. Remember, narrate in present tense and include sensory details. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm in the hospital. The air is sterile, and there's that constant beeping of machines. Sarah, my wife, she's lying in the bed. She looks so small, so fragile. Her skin is pale, almost translucent. I can see the blue veins in her hands.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The room is dim, but there's a harsh fluorescent light above her bed. It makes everything look washed out. I'm sitting in this uncomfortable plastic chair, holding her hand. It's cold... so cold. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. We were supposed to have more time.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's a faint smell of disinfectant. It's making me feel a bit nauseous. Or maybe that's just the stress. I can hear nurses chatting outside, and it feels so... wrong. How can they be so normal when my world is falling apart?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I... I'm watching her breathing. It's so shallow. Each breath seems like it might be her last. I'm terrified to look away, afraid she'll slip away if I do. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't get enough air myself.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The doctor comes in. He's speaking, but I can barely hear him over the roaring in my ears. Something about \"comfort measures\" and \"not long now.\" I want to scream at him, tell him to do something, anything! But I just nod, feeling helpless.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. I can feel my shoulders hunching, like I'm trying to make myself smaller. My throat is tight, and I'm fighting back tears. I don't want Sarah to see me cry. I need to be strong for her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I lean in close to her. I can smell her perfume, just faintly. It's the same one she's worn for years. I tell her... I tell her it's okay to let go. That I love her, that I'll be okay. But inside, I'm falling apart. How can I be okay without her? We've been together for over 50 years.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm devastated. Angry. Scared. It feels like my heart is being ripped out of my chest. I want to run away, but I can't leave her. I won't leave her.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 85 now. This is... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Her breathing... it's changing. It's becoming more irregular. I know what's happening, but I can't accept it. I'm holding her hand tighter, as if I could keep her here by sheer force of will. The machine's beeping is slowing down. Each pause between beeps feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: What do you see? What do you hear?",
    "Client: I see her face. It's... it's relaxed now. The lines of pain that have been there for weeks are smoothing out. I can hear the rain outside, pattering against the window. It feels like the world is crying with me. And then... and then the beeping stops. Just... stops.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. The silence is deafening. I'm waiting for the next beep, but it doesn't come. A nurse rushes in, checks the machines. She looks at me with pity, and I know. I know Sarah's gone. I collapse over her body, sobbing. I can feel the warmth leaving her. It's... it's like the color is draining from the world.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest hurts. It feels so real, like I'm losing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. It's... it's not happening now.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I stayed there, holding her. The staff was kind, they didn't rush me. But eventually, I had to let go. Had to step back and let them... let them take her away. I remember walking out of the hospital. The sun was shining, and it felt so wrong. How could the world just go on?",
    "Therapist: What did you do next?",
    "Client: I... I got in my car. Just sat there for a long time. I couldn't bring myself to start it, to drive home to an empty house. I called our daughter, Jane. I could barely get the words out. She said she'd come right away, but I told her no. I needed... I needed time.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But... but also a little relieved. Like I've let out something I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. Still high, but... but better.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was hard. Harder than I expected. But... but I think it helped. It's like... like I've faced the worst of it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment before I leave.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
