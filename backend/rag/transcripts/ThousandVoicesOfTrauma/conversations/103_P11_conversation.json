    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that medical procedure again in my mind was intense. I could almost feel the cold metal of the instruments, you know? And the smell of the antiseptic... it brought me right back there. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The moment when the doctor told me there were complications. I felt so helpless and scared. It's like I was reliving that panic all over again. But... I guess I made it through the memory this time without completely losing it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I faced this monster in my head and I'm still here. But it's exhausting too. I'm drained.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed something weird. When I was recalling the nurse's face, I kept thinking about my ex-wife. She wasn't even there during the procedure, but somehow her face kept popping up. Do you think that means something?",
    "Therapist: Interesting observation. Thoughts?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe it's because she was the first person I saw when I woke up after surgery? Or... I don't know, perhaps it's tied to feeling vulnerable? Our divorce was pretty rough, and I felt pretty exposed and weak then too.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding medical check-ups since then. Even at work, when we have our annual physicals, I find excuses to skip them. It's affecting my health, I know. And maybe... maybe it's affecting my relationships too? I've been pretty closed off since the divorce.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What might help?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start small. Like, scheduling a simple check-up? And perhaps talking to my kids about why I've been so distant. It's scary, but... I can't keep living like this, can I?",
    "Therapist: Brave insights. Next steps?",
    "Client: I'll make that appointment this week. And maybe... maybe I'll call my daughter for coffee. Baby steps, right? This whole process is teaching me that I'm stronger than I thought. It's tough, but... I think I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Proud of your progress.",
    "Client: Thanks. It means a lot to hear that. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just going in circles, you know? But today, even though it was hard, I feel like I've taken a step forward. Is that normal? To feel both exhausted and a bit hopeful at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Very normal. How to nurture hope?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to acknowledge my small victories more? Like today, getting through the memory without a full-blown panic attack. And maybe... maybe I can start a journal? Write down these little steps forward. It might help me see progress when I'm feeling stuck.",
    "Therapist: Sounds beneficial. Any concerns?",
    "Client: I'm worried about nightmares. After sessions like this, sometimes they get worse for a few days. I know you said it's part of the process, but it's hard. Especially since I live with my son now. I don't want to wake him up with my shouting.",
    "Therapist: Valid concern. Coping strategies?",
    "Client: I've been trying that grounding technique you taught me. Focusing on five things I can see, four I can touch, and so on. It helps sometimes. And I've been thinking about telling my son what's going on. He's old enough to understand, I think. Maybe if he knows, I won't feel so... ashamed when it happens.",
    "Therapist: Open communication can help. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was tough, but... good. I feel drained, but also like I've accomplished something. Is it okay if I call you if things get rough this week?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You're doing great, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it. I'll see you next week, and... I'll try to remember that I'm making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take care, Carlos."
