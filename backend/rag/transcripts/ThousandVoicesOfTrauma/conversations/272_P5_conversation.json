    "Therapist: Welcome back, Samira. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've been building up to this, but I'm not sure what to expect. It's bringing up a lot of anxiety for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. Can you explain it a bit more? I've been thinking about it since our last session, and I'm not sure I fully grasp what we'll be doing.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memories in a safe environment. It helps process them.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I've spent so many years trying to forget those experiences in the cult. The idea of purposely remembering them is frightening. Will it make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. This process actually helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I suppose that makes sense. But how will reliving those memories help? I'm worried about feeling overwhelmed or losing control.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout. What specific concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about the flashbacks becoming more intense. Sometimes, even now, I feel like I'm back there, and it's terrifying. What if this makes those episodes more frequent or vivid? And... I'm ashamed of some of the things that happened. Talking about them out loud feels... exposing.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll work together to manage any distress. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... these memories, they're not just in my mind. I can feel them in my body, you know? The tension, the fear... it's like it never left. But I want to get better. I want to be able to talk about my past without feeling like it's consuming me.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous goal. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing more about the process might help ease some of my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll describe a memory, and I'll guide you through it. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too overwhelming. Will I need to close my eyes? Sometimes when I do that, the memories feel more intense.",
    "Therapist: It's your choice. Some find it helpful, others prefer eyes open. What feels right for you?",
    "Client: I think... I might feel safer with my eyes open, at least to start. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your comfort is crucial. Any other questions or concerns?",
    "Client: I guess I'm wondering about afterwards. Will I be okay to drive home? Sometimes when I've thought about these memories in the past, I've felt... disconnected from reality for a while after.",
    "Therapist: Great question. We'll end with grounding exercises to help you feel present. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I... I really want this to work. I want to be able to talk about my experiences without feeling like they're happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Remember, this is a process. We'll take it step by step together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your support. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to try. Let's do this."
