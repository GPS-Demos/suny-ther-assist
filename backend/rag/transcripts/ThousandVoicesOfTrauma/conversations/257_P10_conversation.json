    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with a SUDS rating from 0 to 100.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... (deep breath) I'm 19 again, and I'm at this... this gathering. It's supposed to be a study group, but something feels off. The room is dimly lit, and there's this sickly-sweet incense burning. I can feel my heart starting to race as I look around at the others. They all seem so... calm, almost eerily so. I'm sitting on the floor, cross-legged, and my legs are starting to go numb.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see him. The leader. He's wearing this ridiculous robe, but everyone's looking at him like he's some kind of god. His eyes... they're so intense. I feel like he's staring right through me. God, I feel so uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: He starts talking about... about purity and transcendence. But the way he's looking at me... I know what's coming. I want to leave, but my body won't move. It's like I'm frozen. He's walking towards me now, and I can smell his cologne. It's overpowering, makes me want to gag.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He's... he's touching my shoulder. Telling me I've been chosen. The others are watching, some look excited, others look... envious? I feel sick. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. His hand is moving down my arm, and I... I...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my stomach is in knots. I feel like I can't breathe. My skin is crawling where he touched me. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now, safe in this room. Can you tell me something you see in the room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue painting on your wall. The one with the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happens next?",
    "Client: (deep breath) He's... he's leading me to a separate room. The others are chanting something, but it's muffled. The room is dark, just a few candles. There's a bed... oh god, there's a bed. I'm shaking. I want to fight, to run, but I can't. He's saying it's a spiritual ritual, that I should feel honored. But I feel... I feel violated before anything's even happened.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Like 90. I feel like I'm there again.",

    "Client: I'm... I'm wearing my blue jeans and my favorite t-shirt.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue?",
    "Client: (voice shaky) He's... he's telling me to undress. Says it's part of the purification. I'm moving so slowly, hoping someone will burst in and stop this. But no one comes. I can hear the chanting getting louder outside. I'm down to my underwear, and I'm shivering. Not just from cold, but from fear. He's smiling, but it's not kind. It's... predatory.",
    "Therapist: You're brave for facing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel angry. And ashamed. And so, so scared.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. Can you describe what happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's touching me. Everywhere. Saying it's to \"cleanse\" me. But it feels dirty, wrong. I'm crying silently. I want to push him away, but I'm afraid of what he'll do if I resist. The chanting outside is so loud now, it's like it's inside my head. I feel like I'm outside my body, watching this happen to someone else. But the pain... the pain brings me back. It hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a moment. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The... the blue painting. Your desk. The clock. The bookshelf. The... the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, when you're ready, can you continue?",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... It's... it's over. He's telling me I'm \"purified\" now. That I should feel grateful. But I feel... I feel broken. Used. Dirty. I'm putting my clothes back on, and my hands won't stop shaking. When I go back out, everyone's smiling at me like I should be happy. But I feel dead inside.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel drained. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like I've finally let this out.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now?",
    "Client: I can hear... the ticking of the clock. The air conditioning. And... and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, three things you can feel.",
    "Client: The... the softness of this chair. My feet on the floor. And... and the fabric of my shirt against my skin.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've shown incredible courage today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But I also feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's... it's hard, but I think it's good.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. You should be proud of yourself. We'll end our session here, but I want you to practice some self-care for the rest of the day. Can you think of something kind you can do for yourself?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might take a long, hot shower when I get home. And maybe watch my favorite movie.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent plan. Remember, what you experienced was not your fault. You're on a journey of healing, and you're making great progress. We'll continue this work in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
