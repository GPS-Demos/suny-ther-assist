    "Therapist: Welcome, Ali. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my stomach is in knots, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the compound. It's early morning, the sun's just coming up. There's this eerie quiet, like everyone's holding their breath. I'm standing outside the main building, my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The leader, he's calling everyone to gather. His voice is... it's calm, but there's this edge to it. I can feel my heart racing. People are shuffling out of their quarters, eyes down, no one's talking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6... maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... So, we're all gathering in the main hall. The air is thick, stuffy. I can smell incense burning, it's making me feel a bit dizzy. The leader, he's standing at the front, his eyes... they're intense, almost glowing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. But also... weirdly excited? Like something big is about to happen. My palms are sweaty, I can feel my t-shirt sticking to my back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He starts talking about... about the \"ascension.\" Says it's time for us to leave this world behind. I... I want to believe him, but there's this voice in my head screaming that something's wrong. I look around, and everyone's nodding, some are crying... they look happy. Why don't I feel happy?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. So, he's handing out these cups. They're filled with this purple liquid. He says it's our \"passage to the next level.\" I... I can smell it from here. It's sweet, sickly sweet. My hands are shaking so bad I'm afraid I'll drop it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see my friend, Sarah. She's already drinking it. Her eyes are closed, she looks... peaceful. But then she starts to sway, and... oh god, she collapses. People around her are smiling, saying she's \"transitioning.\" I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. Okay. So, the leader, he's looking at me now. He's smiling, but his eyes are cold. He's telling me it's my turn. I... I don't want to. But everyone's watching. I feel so alone, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I pretend to drink. I bring the cup to my lips, but I don't swallow. My heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst. People around me are starting to fall, some are convulsing. I want to scream, to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My SUDS is still at 9. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. So, I'm standing there, surrounded by... by bodies. The leader, he's collapsed too. I'm the only one left standing. The silence is... it's deafening. I can hear my own heartbeat. I... I drop the cup. The sound of it hitting the floor echoes through the hall.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I run. I just... I run. Out of the hall, past the buildings. I can hear sirens in the distance. My lungs are burning, my legs feel like lead, but I keep running. I don't stop until I reach the main road. There's a police car there. I... I collapse in front of it, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: You made it out. You survived. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Exhausted. But also... relieved? My SUDS is down to a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Yeah... okay. I... I can't believe I made it through that.",
    "Therapist: You did, and you've shown immense courage. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart's still racing a bit. My hands are clammy. But I feel... I feel more present now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's focus on your breath for a moment. In... and out.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... that helps.",
    "Therapist: You've just revisited a deeply traumatic experience. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. For surviving when others didn't. But also... proud? That I had the strength to resist, to run. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. Let's explore them a bit more.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about Sarah, about the others. Could I have done something? Should I have tried to stop them?",
    "Therapist: What do you think now, looking back?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Logically, I know I couldn't have saved everyone. But emotionally... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling for survivors. How has this experience affected your life since then?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I have trouble trusting people now. I second-guess everything. And the nightmares... they're less frequent now, but still intense.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. With school, with work. Sometimes I use... substances. To numb it all. I know it's not healthy, but...",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. We'll work on healthier coping strategies. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after an exposure session. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's take a few more deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Yeah, that helps. I... I didn't think I could do this.",
    "Therapist: But you did, and you did well. How do you feel about continuing these sessions?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll continue at your pace. For now, let's focus on grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Name five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: The clock, your desk, the plant in the corner, the painting on the wall, and my shoes.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my watch, and... the carpet under my feet.",
    "Therapist: Great. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: Perfect. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job, Ali. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: More... more here. Present. My SUDS is down to a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I feel like I've taken a step forward.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. We'll end our session here. Remember to be kind to yourself this week.",
    "Client: I'll try. Thank you... for everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Ali. I'll see you next week."
