    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? Watching that poor guy get beaten by the cops. I can still hear the sound of their batons hitting him, and the way he was crying out for help. It's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I mean, I wanted to do something, to step in and stop it, but I was frozen. I couldn't move. And now I'm wondering... what if that had been me? What if it had been my brother or my partner? It makes me feel so angry and scared at the same time. Like, how can people who are supposed to protect us do something so brutal? And then I feel guilty for not doing more to help.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. How does your body feel as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My muscles are all tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I feel... I don't know, kind of light-headed? Like I'm not fully here. It's strange because I know I'm safe in this room, but my body is reacting like I'm still in danger.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to ground myself a bit. Maybe... maybe talk about something positive? It's just, after reliving that memory, everything feels so dark and hopeless. I keep thinking about how this kind of thing is still happening, you know? It's not just a one-time event. And that makes me feel so... powerless. Like no matter what I do, nothing will change.",
    "Therapist: I hear your frustration. Can you tell me about a time you felt empowered recently?",
    "Client: Hmm... Well, last week I attended a community meeting about police reform. I spoke up about my experience and... people listened. They really seemed to care. For a moment, I felt like maybe my voice could make a difference. It was small, but it felt good to be heard, you know? Like maybe I'm not as powerless as I sometimes feel.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does reflecting on that make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually helping a bit. My breathing is slowing down some. I'm remembering that there are good people out there who want change too. It doesn't erase what happened, but... I don't know, it gives me a glimmer of hope? Like maybe by speaking out and sharing my story, I can contribute to preventing this from happening to others. It's not much, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How else has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: I've become much more aware of injustice around me. Not just police brutality, but all kinds of systemic issues. It's like my eyes have been opened, you know? And while that awareness can be painful sometimes, I think it's important. I'm more involved in my community now, more likely to speak up when I see something wrong. But it's also made me more anxious in some ways. I'm always on edge when I see police now, even when they're not doing anything wrong. It's like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That heightened awareness can be challenging. How do you cope with the anxiety?",
    "Client: I've been trying different things. Deep breathing helps sometimes. And I've started meditating, which is new for me. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it helps me feel more centered. I also talk to my partner a lot. She's been really supportive through all of this. Oh, and I've been journaling. Getting my thoughts out on paper seems to help them stop spinning around in my head so much. But sometimes... sometimes it still feels like too much, you know?",
    "Therapist: It's great you're finding ways to cope. What else comes up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has affected my relationships. With my partner, it's brought us closer in some ways. She's been so understanding and supportive. But with some friends, especially those who haven't experienced anything like this, there's this disconnect now. It's like they can't fully understand, and sometimes I feel lonely even when I'm with them. And with my family... well, they worry about me more now. I can see it in their eyes when I talk about what happened or about going to protests. They're scared for me, and that makes me feel guilty sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Relationships often shift after trauma. How do you navigate that?",
    "Client: It's tough, you know? I'm trying to be patient with people who don't get it, but sometimes it's frustrating. I've found myself gravitating more towards friends who've had similar experiences or who are involved in activism. They just... they get it without me having to explain everything. With my family, I'm trying to reassure them while also being honest about what I'm going through. It's a balancing act. And with my partner, I'm just... I'm so grateful. She's been my rock through all of this. I'm learning to lean on her support while also making sure I'm not overwhelming her with my struggles.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to balance. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... calmer, I think. Still a bit shaky, but not as overwhelmed. Talking through it all, especially the positive parts like the community meeting and my support system, it helps put things in perspective. The memory is still there, still painful, but it doesn't feel as all-consuming right now. I'm remembering that there's more to my life than just this trauma, even if it sometimes feels like it defines everything. It's... it's a relief, honestly.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's one thing you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that I'm not alone in this. That there are people who understand, who want to help, who are fighting for change. And that even though what I witnessed was horrible, it's also pushed me to grow in ways I never expected. I'm stronger than I realized, and I'm making a difference, even if it's in small ways. That's important to hold onto, especially on the tough days.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we maybe do a quick grounding exercise? Something to help me transition back into the rest of my day? I'm feeling better, but I want to make sure I'm fully present before I leave. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have a space where I can process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: [Inhales deeply, then exhales slowly] That's good. I can feel my feet on the floor, my back against the chair. I'm here, in this room, safe. The memory is just that now - a memory. It's part of me, but it doesn't control me. I think... I think I'm ready to face the rest of my day now. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
