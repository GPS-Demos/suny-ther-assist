    "Therapist: Welcome, Arjun. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the human trafficking incident, and it's bringing up a lot of anxiety for me already.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 60. My heart's beating pretty fast.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in the clinic. It's busy, lots of people around. I'm there for my regular check-up, but something feels off. There's this group of people near the reception, they look nervous, out of place. I notice one of them has a bruise on their arm.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell of disinfectant is really strong. It's making me feel a bit nauseous. I can hear muffled conversations, but one voice stands out. It's angry, demanding. I look over and see a man arguing with the receptionist.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach's in knots. I feel... I feel frozen. Like I should do something, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The angry man turns around suddenly. He makes eye contact with me, and I just know something's wrong. He starts walking towards me, and I... I panic. I try to stand up, but my legs feel weak.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Arjun. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I manage to stand up. My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it. I look around for help, but everyone seems oblivious. The man's getting closer, and I see he's reaching for something in his pocket.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I start backing away, bumping into chairs. People are starting to notice now. There's a commotion at the reception desk. I hear shouting, but it's like I'm underwater. Everything's muffled.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking I need to get out. I need to warn someone. But I'm also terrified of what might happen if I do. My mind's racing, trying to piece together what's going on.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. Someone's knocked over a tray of instruments. It snaps me out of my daze. I turn and run towards the exit, but I can hear footsteps behind me. I'm pushing through people, muttering apologies, but I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: How's your body feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tense. My muscles are tight, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm at the exit now. I burst through the doors, the sunlight momentarily blinding me. I hear sirens in the distance. People are shouting behind me. I keep running, not sure where I'm going, just away from there.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 now. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Arjun. Remember, you're safe here. What happens after you run out?",
    "Client: I... I run down the street, dodging people on the sidewalk. I can hear chaos behind me, but I don't look back. I duck into an alley, my lungs burning. I'm gasping for air, trying to make sense of what just happened.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Confused. Guilty. I left those people behind. What if something happened to them? But I also feel... relieved. Like I narrowly escaped something horrible.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I pull out my phone with shaking hands. I dial 911, but I can barely speak when they answer. I'm trying to explain what I saw, but it's all coming out jumbled. I'm crying now, I realize.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight. My hands are still shaking. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In for four, hold for four, out for four.",
    "Client: *breathing exercises* Okay... I'm starting to calm down a little. The operator is asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. I hear more sirens, getting closer. I peek out of the alley and see police cars racing towards the clinic.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I... I'm wondering if I did the right thing. If I should go back. If those people are okay. I'm replaying everything in my head, trying to make sense of it all. Did I really see what I think I saw?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: A police car pulls up near the alley. An officer gets out and starts approaching me. I'm still shaking, but I force myself to stand up straight. I try to explain what I saw, but my words are all jumbled.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Scared. But also... relieved? Like maybe now someone can help those people. My head is pounding, though. I feel lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80 now. Still pretty high.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens with the police officer?",
    "Client: The officer is asking me questions. I'm trying to focus, to remember details. What the man looked like, how many people were with him. It's all a blur. I keep thinking about the bruise I saw on that person's arm. I should have noticed sooner, should have done something.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Stay in the moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: More police arrive. They're asking me to come with them, to give a statement. I'm hesitant, but I go. As we drive back to the clinic, I see ambulances, more police cars. It's chaos. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: How's your body feeling now?",
    "Client: My stomach's in knots. I feel nauseous. My hands are clammy, and I can't stop fidgeting.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel the seat beneath you.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... We're at the clinic now. There are people everywhere. Some are crying, others look shell-shocked. I see some of the people from earlier being led to ambulances. They look... broken. I feel a wave of guilt wash over me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Arjun. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm taken inside to give my statement. The clinic looks so different now. Things are knocked over, there's paper everywhere. I can't believe this is the same place I was in just an hour ago. As I'm talking to the detective, I start to piece things together. Human trafficking. That's what was happening right in front of me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that realization. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. Disgusted. How could this happen? And scared. What if those people come back? What if they find out I reported them? But also... I feel a strange sense of purpose. Like maybe my actions helped somehow.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. What happens after you give your statement?",
    "Client: They... they tell me I can go home. But I don't want to. I feel like I should stay, do more. Help somehow. But I'm also exhausted. Drained. I step outside and the sun's starting to set. It feels surreal, like the whole world should have stopped because of what happened.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm so tired. My muscles ache. My head is pounding. But I still feel on edge, like I can't relax.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Focus on the present moment. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. Still high, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Arjun. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *opens eyes slowly* Wow... that was intense. I... I didn't realize how much I remembered.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. Like a weight has been lifted somehow? It's still hard, but talking about it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've shown great courage today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Arjun. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together."
