    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Doc. It's like I'm back there again, you know? My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off those memories.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Man, it's... it's overwhelming. I keep seeing their faces, those men who trafficked us. The way they'd look at us, like we weren't even human. Just... just property. And I feel so... so ashamed. I was supposed to protect my family, you know? But I couldn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of guilt. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, guilt. That's it. I mean, I'm a man, right? I should've been able to fight back, to keep my wife and kids safe. But they had weapons, and... and... I was just frozen. I couldn't move. I couldn't think. I just... I just let it happen. What kind of man does that make me?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm suffocating. My throat feels tight, and my hands are shaking. I can feel sweat on my forehead, and my stomach's in knots. It's like my body's reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I can smell it. The musty odor of that shipping container they kept us in. It's like it's burned into my nose. And I can hear the clanging of the metal doors, the whispers of the other people trapped with us. It's all so vivid, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does this memory connect to your experiences now?",
    "Client: I... I guess it explains a lot. Why I can't stand small spaces, why I flinch at loud noises. And the drinking... it was my way of trying to forget, to numb myself. But it never really worked, did it? It just made everything worse.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you feeling as you make these connections?",
    "Client: Anger. So much anger. At those men, at myself, at the world for letting this happen. But also... also a bit of relief? Like, maybe understanding all this can help me move forward somehow. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you elaborate on that feeling of relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've been carrying this weight, you know? This shame and confusion about why I am the way I am. Why I struggle with alcohol, why I have nightmares, why I can't seem to connect with my family like I used to. But talking about it, really facing it... it's hard, but it's like I'm finally starting to make sense of things.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization impact your view of recovery?",
    "Client: I... I think it gives me hope. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can get better. Maybe I'm not just broken or weak. This happened to me, and it was terrible, but... but maybe I can learn to live with it. Maybe I can learn to be the husband and father I want to be again.",
    "Therapist: What do you need to move towards that goal?",
    "Client: Support, I guess. And patience. This isn't going to be easy, and I know I'll have setbacks. But I want to keep doing this work, keep facing these memories. I want to understand myself better and learn how to cope without turning to the bottle. And... and I think I need to be honest with my family about what happened. They deserve to know.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Terrified, honestly. But also... determined? Like, I've been carrying this secret for so long, and it's been eating me up inside. Maybe sharing it will help them understand me better. And maybe... maybe it'll bring us closer together. I don't know. It's scary, but I think it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: What support do you think you'll need for that conversation?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can do it alone. Maybe... maybe you could help me prepare for it? And I think I'd like my wife to come to a session, if that's okay. I don't know if I can find the words on my own.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We can work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for years. It hurts, but it's a good hurt, if that makes sense. Like... like maybe this is the first step towards healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to keep exploring these memories. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself. And maybe... maybe we can start planning how to talk to my family. I'm nervous about it, but I think it's time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How will you take care of yourself until then?",
    "Client: I... I'll try to use some of those grounding techniques we talked about. And I think I'll call my sponsor more often. Maybe even try to get to a meeting every day. I know I need the support right now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm good. This was tough, but... but I'm glad we did it. Thank you, Doc. For listening, for helping me make sense of all this. I know I've got a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
