    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of reliving that hostage situation... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll do today.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening, but I'm not sure I can go through with this. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. This exercise helps process trauma memories. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this. It seems counterintuitive to deliberately revisit such a horrific experience.",
    "Therapist: It allows your brain to reprocess the memory, reducing its emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. But won't it make things worse? I've spent years trying to forget that day.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance can actually maintain PTSD symptoms. Facing the memory helps heal.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. But how will I handle the emotions? I'm afraid I might fall apart.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We'll go at your pace and can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I trust you, but I'm still scared. What exactly will happen during this exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. I'll guide you through it gently.",
    "Client: Present tense? As if it's happening now? Oh God, that sounds intense. How long will it last?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. Remember, you're safe here. It's just a memory now.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm willing to try. But what if I panic or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: We can take breaks or stop if needed. Your wellbeing is the priority.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your patience. I know this is important for my recovery. I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Now, tell me about that day..."
