    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? I can still hear the shouting, see the anger on my coworker's face. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe... maybe it's more like anxiety? My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment, watching it all unfold and not being able to do anything.",
    "Therapist: Where in your body do you feel that anxiety most intensely?",
    "Client: Definitely in my chest. It's like there's this heavy weight pressing down on me. And my stomach feels kind of queasy, like I might be sick. I'm also noticing that my shoulders are really tense, like I'm bracing for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the scene over and over. I'm thinking, \"Why didn't I do something? Why didn't I try to stop it?\" And then I start wondering if it could happen again. What if next time it's worse? What if someone gets seriously hurt? I feel... I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does feeling powerless affect you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me want to withdraw, you know? Like, maybe if I keep to myself, stay quiet, I can avoid situations like that in the future. But then I get angry at myself for thinking that way. I shouldn't have to change who I am because of what happened. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to feel that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of empowering, in a way. Like, for a moment, I don't feel so helpless. But then it fades, and I'm left feeling guilty. Should I be angry? Is it okay to feel this way? I'm not sure anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after the incident?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's different now. Right after it happened, I was just in shock. I couldn't really process anything. I felt numb, disconnected. But now, reliving it like this, it's more intense in some ways. The emotions are stronger, clearer. It's like I'm finally allowing myself to really feel what happened.",
    "Therapist: What's that like, allowing yourself to feel?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... but also kind of freeing? Like, I've been holding all this in for so long, and now it's finally coming out. It hurts, yeah, but it also feels like... like maybe I'm starting to process it? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How do you think this might help in your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe by facing it head-on like this, I'm taking some of its power away? It's still scary, still painful, but it feels a little less overwhelming each time we do this. And I'm starting to see that I'm stronger than I thought. I'm here, I'm talking about it, I'm feeling it... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... that I'm okay. Like, even though remembering is hard, I'm safe here. My body's starting to calm down a bit. The tightness in my chest is easing up. I'm... I'm actually kind of proud of myself for getting through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Really good, actually. Like maybe there's hope, you know? That I won't always feel this way, that I can work through this. It's still scary, and I know we have more work to do, but... but I feel like I can do this. Like I'm not alone in this anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that I'm stronger than I realized. That facing this is hard, but it's possible. And that even though the memory is still scary, I'm safe now. I'm not powerless anymore. I'm... I'm taking control of my recovery, one step at a time.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent takeaway. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. I'm still a bit shaky, but I feel more grounded than when we started. And there's this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment maybe? Like I've faced something big and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I think I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot, you know? But... but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand myself a little better now. And maybe... maybe next time it won't be quite so scary to face these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit quietly for a moment? I'd like to take a few deep breaths, kind of center myself before I leave. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'm ready to go now. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care."
