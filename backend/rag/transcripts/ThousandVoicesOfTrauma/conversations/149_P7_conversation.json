    "Therapist: Welcome back, Raj. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my divorce again, and it still feels raw.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, I feel this tightness in my chest. The day my ex-wife told me she was leaving... it brought back so many memories of the physical abuse I endured as a child. I felt so helpless, just like back then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you tell me more about that day?",
    "Client: It was a Tuesday evening. I had just come home from work. The house was unusually quiet. I called out for her, but there was no response. Then I saw her suitcases by the door. My heart started racing. When she came downstairs, her face was so cold, so distant. She said, \"Raj, I can't do this anymore. I'm leaving.\" I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I felt like I was that little boy again, cowering in the corner as my father raised his hand. The same fear, the same helplessness. I wanted to beg her to stay, but I couldn't find my voice. My hands were shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember reaching out to touch her arm, but she flinched away. That small gesture... it broke something inside me. I felt so rejected, so worthless. All I could think was, \"Not again. Please, not again.\" I was reliving every moment my father had told me I was nothing, that I deserved the pain.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's so hard. I started pleading with her, promising I'd change, that I'd be better. But she just shook her head and picked up her bags. As she walked out the door, I collapsed to the floor. I couldn't stop shaking. The silence in the house was deafening. I felt so alone, so abandoned. It was like my whole world had shattered, and I was right back in that place of fear and pain from my childhood.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... the memories are so vivid. I can still smell her perfume as she walked past me for the last time. I can hear the sound of the door closing behind her. And then... nothing. Just this overwhelming emptiness and fear. I didn't know how to be alone. I didn't know who I was without her. It felt like I was losing everything all over again, just like when I was a child and had no control over the abuse.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit, but I think I'm okay. It's strange, but talking about it... it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts, but it's like I can see it from a different perspective now. I'm not that helpless child anymore, and I'm not the same man I was when my wife left. I've survived both those experiences.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to believe sometimes, but I am stronger now. I've been learning to live on my own, to rediscover who I am without the shadow of abuse or the crutch of my marriage.

    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Raj. How do you feel about ending here for today?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I feel like I've made some real progress. Thank you for your support and guidance.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
