    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, Dr. Johnson. I know we're going to talk about the trafficking incident, and I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but just thinking about it makes my heart race. It's been 15 years, but it feels like yesterday.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a hot summer day when I first met them. They promised me a job overseas, a chance to support my family. I was so naive...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They took my passport as soon as we landed. Said it was for safekeeping. I should have known then, but I was desperate. The factory was... it was hell. We worked 18-hour days, no breaks, barely any food.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I can still smell the chemicals, hear the machines whirring. There were others like me, all of us trapped. I remember a young boy, couldn't have been more than 12. He collapsed one day, and they... they just dragged him away. We never saw him again.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're doing great.",
    "Client: It was. I... I can't... The foreman, he would beat us if we slowed down. I still have scars on my back. Sometimes, I wake up feeling the lashes...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're very brave.",
    "Client: I don't feel brave. I feel weak. I should have fought back, should have found a way to escape sooner.",
    "Therapist: You survived. That takes immense strength.",
    "Client: Maybe. But the guilt... the others I left behind. I managed to slip away during a shipment, but so many others couldn't. Their faces haunt me every night.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you had to.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. I've built a life here, but I feel like I'm living a lie. Like I don't deserve this freedom.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely deserve it. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I think about reaching out to organizations that fight trafficking. Maybe I could help. But then the fear takes over. What if they find me? What if they hurt my family back home?",
    "Therapist: Your safety is important. We can explore safe ways to help.",
    "Client: I suppose. It's just... I feel so alone. How can anyone understand what I've been through? How can I ever have a normal relationship when this is always in the background?",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. There's support available.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of feeling like this, Dr. Johnson. Tired of the nightmares, the constant looking over my shoulder. I want to feel... normal.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress.",
    "Client: Am I? Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck. Like I'll never move past this.",
    "Therapist: Each session is a step forward. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I guess... It's just hard to see it sometimes. There are days when I can almost forget, and then something small triggers everything. A certain smell, a loud noise, and suddenly I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's common with trauma. We'll work on coping strategies.",
    "Client: I hope they help. I'm just so tired of living like this, always on edge. I want to be able to trust people again, to feel safe in my own skin.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. I know it's not easy listening to all this.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Our time is almost up. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common reaction. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Mr. Lee."
