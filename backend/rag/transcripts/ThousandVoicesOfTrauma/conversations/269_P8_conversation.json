    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm still there, you know? The earthquake, the shaking... I can feel it in my body. My hands are trembling a bit. It's hard to shake off that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't take a full breath. And there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here. I keep seeing flashes of buildings crumbling, hearing the screams... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not rational, but I can't help it. And then there's this guilt... I survived when so many didn't. I remember the cult leader saying it was a punishment from God. Part of me still wonders if he was right, even though I know better now.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like I don't deserve peace or happiness. My chronic pain flares up when I think about it, as if my body is punishing me too. It's exhausting, living with this constant fear and guilt.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. Angry at the cult leader for manipulating us, angry at myself for believing him. And there's this deep sadness too. For all the lives lost, for the years I spent living in fear. It's like a heavy weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Before, I couldn't even talk about the earthquake without having a panic attack. Now, it's still intense, but I can sit with the feelings more. They don't completely overwhelm me like they used to. I guess that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: What's helping you cope in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we practiced. Focusing on my breath, feeling my feet on the floor. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It helps a little, but it's still hard.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I find myself thinking about my partner. How supportive they've been through all this. It makes me realize how far I've come from the isolation of the cult. There's a glimmer of hope there, you know? Like maybe I can heal from this, maybe I deserve to be happy.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, to acknowledge that hope?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, honestly. Part of me wants to push it away, like I don't deserve it. But there's another part that's desperate to hold onto it. It's like a lifeline in all this darkness. I want to believe it, but it's hard.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to allow yourself that hope?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It would mean letting go of so much. The guilt, the fear... they've been a part of me for so long. But maybe... maybe it would also mean freedom. A chance to really live, not just survive. It's terrifying, but also... exciting? Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you consider this?",
    "Client: It's strange. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as constricting. I feel a warmth in my stomach, like a tiny spark of something positive. My shoulders feel a bit lighter too. It's like... like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of these changes?",
    "Client: I... I think it's a good sign? Maybe it means I'm starting to heal, to process all of this. It's not easy, and I know there's still a long way to go. But for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit with this feeling for a moment. This tiny bit of hope. It's fragile, but it's there. And maybe acknowledge how far I've come. It's been a hard journey, but I'm still here, still fighting. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll pick up here next time."
