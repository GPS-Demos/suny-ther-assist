    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene when you witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work, it was late, around 10 PM. The street was dimly lit, and I could hear shouting coming from an alley. I... I hesitated, but then I heard a scream. I moved closer to see what was happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: As I approached the alley, I saw two men. One was holding the other against the wall. The man being held was bleeding from his face. I... I froze. I couldn't move. The attacker was shouting something about money, but I couldn't make out everything he was saying. The victim looked terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... scared. My heart was racing, and my palms were sweaty. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear. I kept thinking, \"What if he sees me? What if he comes after me next?\" I felt so helpless and ashamed for not doing anything.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The attacker suddenly pulled out a knife. I gasped, and I think he heard me because he turned his head slightly. I ducked behind a dumpster, praying he hadn't seen me. I could hear the victim pleading, \"Please, don't. I'll get you the money, I swear.\" Then there was a grunt and a thud.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I peeked around the dumpster and saw the victim on the ground, holding his side. There was blood... so much blood. The attacker was running away. I wanted to help, but I was so scared. I fumbled for my phone to call 911, but my hands were shaking so badly I could barely dial.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: As I was talking to the dispatcher, I approached the victim. He was conscious but in so much pain. I told him help was coming, but I felt useless. I didn't know what to do. Should I have tried to stop the bleeding? Should I have chased the attacker? I just stood there, feeling guilty and terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How did your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: My whole body was tense. My stomach was in knots, and I felt like I might throw up. I couldn't stop shaking, and I kept looking around, afraid the attacker might come back. The victim's groans of pain were making me feel dizzy. I wanted to run away, but I knew I couldn't leave him there alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: The wait for the ambulance felt like hours. I kept talking to the victim, trying to keep him awake. He was getting paler, and I was terrified he might die right there in front of me. When I finally heard the sirens, I felt a rush of relief, but also a new wave of panic. What would I tell the police? Would they blame me for not doing more?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel conflicted. You're safe now.",
    "Client: As the paramedics took over, a police officer started asking me questions. I could barely focus on what he was saying. I kept replaying the scene in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently. The guilt was overwhelming. Even after I gave my statement and went home, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the victim's face and the glint of the knife.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well describing this difficult memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings back all those feelings of fear and guilt. But there's also a small sense of relief, like I'm not carrying this secret alone anymore. It's still painful, but maybe a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this in so much detail. It's still hard, and I worry about having nightmares tonight. But I also feel like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll end here for today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed."
