    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure focused on your cult experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. My stomach's in knots, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to a specific moment. Describe what's happening in present tense.",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm standing outside the compound. It's early morning, the air is crisp. I can smell damp earth and hear birds chirping. But my heart is racing because I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The gates are opening. I see... I see the leader walking out. He's wearing his usual white robe, looking so calm and serene. But I know it's all a facade. My palms are sweating as he approaches me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he puts his hand on my shoulder. Says, \"My child, you've disappointed us.\" His voice is soft, but there's a cold edge to it. I feel sick, like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's... he's leading me inside now. Past the other members. They're all watching, their eyes full of judgment. I want to run, but I can't. My legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: We're in his office now. It's... it's so quiet. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. He's telling me I need to be \"purified.\" That I've let outside influences corrupt me. I'm... I'm shaking. I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's... it's hard to breathe. I can feel myself starting to panic, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... okay. He's... he's making me kneel. Telling me to confess my sins. But I haven't done anything wrong! I just... I just talked to my cousin outside the compound. That's all.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm so angry. And scared. I want to scream that this is all bullshit, but I can't. The words are stuck in my throat. I'm just... I'm just kneeling there, trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. A 9, maybe.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're in control here. We can pause if you need to.",
    "Client: No, I... I want to keep going. He's... he's starting the \"purification\" now. Making me repeat these... these awful things about myself. That I'm weak, that I'm nothing without the group. His voice is so calm, but it's like poison.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you say those things?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel small. Worthless. Part of me knows it's not true, but another part... another part believes him. I can feel myself shrinking, becoming less... less me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: It goes on for hours. My knees are aching, my throat is raw from repeating his words. But the worst part... the worst part is feeling my own identity slipping away. By the end, I'm... I'm just an empty shell.",
    "Therapist: What's happening around you now?",
    "Client: He's... he's helping me up. Telling me I've done well, that I'm purified now. And I... God, I feel grateful. How messed up is that? I'm thanking him for... for breaking me down.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction in these situations. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm leaving his office now. The other members are still there, but now they're smiling. Welcoming me back. It feels... it feels good, but also terrifying. Like I've lost something I can never get back.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But there's this weird sense of peace too. Like I've given up fighting and just... surrendered.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. Describe it more.",
    "Client: It's... it's like floating. Like I'm not quite in my body anymore. Everything feels distant, muffled. I know I should be upset, but I just... I just feel numb.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they lead me to the dining hall. Everyone's acting like nothing happened. Like it's just another day. I'm sitting there, eating, but I can't taste anything. It's all just... ash in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel angry again. At them, at myself for letting it happen. But I can't show it. I have to keep smiling, keep pretending everything's fine.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to hold inside. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The day just... goes on. Like normal. But nothing feels normal anymore. I'm going through the motions, doing my chores, but inside... inside I'm screaming. I want to run, to get out, but I'm... I'm too scared.",
    "Therapist: What's keeping you there?",
    "Client: Fear. Shame. The belief that maybe... maybe they're right. That I really am nothing without them. It's like... it's like they've rewired my brain.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful feeling. How does your body feel as you think about that?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like I'm carrying this... this invisible weight. My shoulders are tense, my jaw is clenched. I just... I just want to collapse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those sensations.",
    "Client: Night is falling now. I'm... I'm in my bunk. Everyone else is asleep, but I'm... I'm wide awake. Staring at the ceiling. Replaying everything in my head. Trying to hold onto... onto who I was before. But it's slipping away.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if I'll ever be myself again. If I'll ever be free. Part of me wants to fight, but another part... another part just wants to give in. To stop fighting. It would be... it would be easier.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult thoughts. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6 now. I'm feeling... I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Slowly open your eyes. Look around the room. Tell me what you see.",
    "Client: I see... I see the painting on your wall. The plant in the corner. Your bookshelf. I'm... I'm here. In your office.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... also kind of relieved? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an exposure. You did really well today. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear the clock ticking. The hum of the air conditioner. And... and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, three things you can feel.",
    "Client: The cushion under me. My feet on the floor. And... and my hands, they're a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Lastly, three things you can see.",
    "Client: Your face. The sunlight coming through the window. And... and my own hands, they've stopped shaking.",
    "Therapist: Well done. You've made significant progress today. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... also kind of proud? I didn't think I could do this, but... but I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed immense courage today. Remember to be gentle with yourself for the rest of the day. Do you have any questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you have the tools to cope with any difficult emotions that may come up. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. See you next week."
