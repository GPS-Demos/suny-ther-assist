    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the night of the home invasion. Use present tense.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Alright... It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm in the living room, watching TV. Sarah and the kids are already asleep upstairs. The house is quiet, except for the low volume of the television.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: I hear a noise... at first, I think it's just the house settling. But then there's another sound, like... like glass breaking. My heart starts racing. I mute the TV and listen carefully.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It... it reminds me of being on patrol in Afghanistan.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear footsteps. They're trying to be quiet, but I can tell someone's in the house. I stand up, looking for something to use as a weapon. All I can find is a heavy table lamp.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. But also angry. How dare they invade my home? I'm thinking about Sarah and the kids upstairs. I have to protect them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) I... I move towards the hallway. The lamp feels heavy in my hands. I can hear them rummaging through the kitchen drawers. My training kicks in, and I try to move silently.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see?",
    "Client: As I round the corner, I see a figure. They're... they're dressed in dark clothes, wearing a mask. They've got their back to me, going through our stuff. I... I freeze for a moment.",
    "Therapist: What happens in that moment of freezing?",
    "Client: I... I'm overwhelmed. Part of me wants to charge at them, but another part is paralyzed with fear. I... I flash back to a night ambush in Kandahar. The darkness, the unknown threat... it's all flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. You're here, in this room. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I grip the lamp tighter. My hands are shaking. I clear my throat loudly, hoping to startle them. The intruder whirls around, and I see the glint of a knife in their hand.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Remember your breathing. Slow, deep breaths. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: The intruder lunges at me with the knife. I... I swing the lamp, barely missing their head. There's a struggle. I can smell their sweat, hear their heavy breathing. It's... it's so intense.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified, but also... also enraged. This person is threatening my family. I manage to grab their wrist, twisting it until they drop the knife. We're grappling now, knocking things over.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The noise... the noise wakes up Sarah. I hear her calling down, asking what's happening. The intruder tries to break free, but I've got them in a hold. I'm yelling for Sarah to call the police.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I... I'm scared the intruder might have an accomplice. I'm worried about Sarah and the kids. But I'm also... I'm also feeling a surge of adrenaline, like I'm back in combat. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) Okay... okay. The intruder is struggling, but I manage to keep them pinned. I can hear Sarah on the phone with the police. The kids are crying upstairs. It feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Finally... finally, I hear sirens. The intruder seems to give up, going limp in my arms. But I don't trust it. I keep them pinned until the police arrive. When they do, it's... it's a blur of lights and voices.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as the police arrive?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Shaking. Part of me is relieved, but another part is still on high alert. I can't seem to let go of the intruder, even as the police try to take over.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What happens after that?",
    "Client: The police handcuff the intruder and take them away. I... I collapse onto the couch. Sarah runs to me, crying. The kids are still upstairs, scared. I want to go to them, but I can barely move.",
    "Therapist: What are you experiencing in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. Drained. But also... also angry. Angry that our home, our safe place, has been violated. I'm holding Sarah, but I feel... I feel disconnected, like I'm watching it all happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85. My chest feels tight, and I'm... I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you can see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the bookshelf, the window, your desk, the plant in the corner, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what happens in the days following the invasion?",
    "Client: I... I can't sleep. Every little noise wakes me up. I keep checking the doors and windows. Sarah wants to talk about it, but I... I shut down. I can't seem to shake this feeling of vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm irritable. Jumpy. I snap at the kids for no reason. I can't focus on work. I keep replaying that night in my head, wondering what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not, really. I've started drinking more in the evenings, just to numb myself enough to sleep. But it's not helping. I feel... I feel like I'm failing my family.",
    "Therapist: You're not failing anyone. You're dealing with trauma. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like releasing some pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) It's... it's strange. Reliving it is painful, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How do you see this experience affecting you now?",
    "Client: I... I still struggle. But I'm trying to be more open with Sarah about how I feel. We've installed a security system, which helps a bit. I'm... I'm working on not letting fear control me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 55. I feel drained, but also... also a bit lighter, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. You've done very well today. Let's end the exposure here and take a few minutes to debrief.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. This was tough, but... but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's discuss what you've learned from this session and how we can apply it moving forward."
