    "Therapist: Mrs. Johnson, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Oh, dear. I'm not quite sure what to expect. At my age, I've been through so much already. Is this going to be difficult? I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your apprehension?",
    "Client: Well, you see, I've spent years trying to forget those awful experiences of being bullied because of my accent and background. The thought of revisiting those memories... it makes my heart race a bit. I've always been taught to keep a stiff upper lip, you know. But I'm worried about how I'll react if I let those feelings out now.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... well, maybe it could help me process things I've bottled up for so long. But I'm scared it might make my depression worse. I've been managing it fairly well lately, and I don't want to upset the apple cart, so to speak.",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. How would you like me to support you?",
    "Client: That's kind of you to ask. I think I'd appreciate some reassurance throughout the process. Perhaps you could remind me that I'm safe here in the present? And maybe we could have a signal if I need a break? I used to use a little bell in my classroom when I was teaching, to get the children's attention. Something like that might be comforting.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. We'll implement those. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. Will this help with the nightmares I've been having? They've become more frequent lately, especially since I've been living alone. I wake up feeling so isolated and scared, remembering those cruel words and taunts from my childhood. It's as if I'm that little girl again, standing in the schoolyard with everyone laughing at my \"funny\" way of speaking.",
    "Therapist: Addressing nightmares is often a positive outcome. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose we should. I'm nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Evans. You've been so patient with me these past few months. It's nice to have someone to talk to who understands. My late husband, God rest his soul, he never quite grasped why these old memories still bothered me so much. But you've helped me see that it's okay to still feel hurt by them. So yes, let's give this a try. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, we'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you, dear. That means a lot. I've always tried to be brave, you know. Had to be, coming to this country as a young woman, facing all that prejudice. But I've never really dealt with how it affected me deep down. I guess it's time to face those demons, isn't it? Even at my age, there's still room for healing, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Healing has no age limit. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm feeling a mix of anxiety and... is it hope? Maybe this will help me finally put some of these old ghosts to rest. I'm ready to try, for my own peace of mind. And who knows? Maybe by working through this, I'll be better equipped to help my granddaughter. She's been facing some bullying at school too, you see. It breaks my heart to think of her going through what I did.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Let's begin gently..."
