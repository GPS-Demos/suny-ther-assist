    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've lived with these memories for so long, but going through them in such detail... it's different. My heart is still racing a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. I hadn't realized how vivid they were in my memory. The screeching of metal, people screaming... It's like I was right back there in that moment. And the smell of smoke... I could almost taste it again.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving those sensations affect you?",
    "Client: It was overwhelming at first. I felt that same panic rising in my chest, just like when it happened. But then... something changed. As I kept going through it, it's like... I don't know, like I could separate myself from it a bit? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. Can you tell me more about that separation?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I was still there, still seeing and feeling everything, but I also knew I was here, safe in this room. It's the first time I've felt that way while thinking about the crash. Usually, I just get lost in the memory, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation, Maria. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's... relief, I think. And maybe a little hope? I've always been so scared of these memories, afraid they'd consume me if I let them in. But now, it feels like maybe I can face them without losing myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I won't be so jumpy when I hear loud noises? Or... perhaps I could start thinking about flying again. I haven't been on a plane since the crash. My granddaughter is getting married in California next year, and I've been dreading the thought of missing it because I can't fly.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I remembered something I'd forgotten. There was a flight attendant, a young woman. In all the chaos, she was so calm, helping people. I think... I think focusing on her helped me get through it back then. Maybe that's why I was able to feel a bit detached this time, like her.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting connection. How can we use that moving forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can try to channel that calmness when I'm feeling overwhelmed? Like, imagine her strength or something? I don't know if that sounds silly...",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It sounds like a helpful strategy. Anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I think it's helping. I've carried this for so long, since I was a child really. It feels like maybe I'm starting to put it down, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Maria. How are you feeling about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but ready. For the first time in years, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel. It's scary, but... I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work more on that idea of separating myself from the memory? And perhaps start talking about how I might prepare myself for potentially flying again. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. My chest feels a bit lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great way to describe it. Remember to use your coping strategies if you need them.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you, doctor. I... I'm glad I'm doing this. It's hard, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: You're making real progress, Maria. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: See you next week. Goodbye.",
    "Therapist: Goodbye, Maria. Take care."
