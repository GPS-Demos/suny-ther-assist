    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the memory of your severe illness?",
    "Client: I think so. It's still difficult to think about, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great already. Take a deep breath and start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember being in the hospital. The room was so cold, and the beeping of the machines was constant. I felt so weak, like I couldn't even lift my arm. The doctors had just told me I had pneumonia, and at my age, it was serious. I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I couldn't stop thinking about my late wife. She'd always taken care of me when I was sick, and now I was alone. The nurses were kind, but it wasn't the same. I remember struggling to breathe, each breath feeling like a battle.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I was so scared I wouldn't make it. I kept thinking about my grandchildren, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The pain in my chest was excruciating, and I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: One night, I woke up gasping for air. I couldn't breathe at all. I pressed the call button, but it felt like an eternity before anyone came. I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die alone in this hospital bed.\"",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The doctors rushed in, and everything became a blur. They were shouting orders, attaching more tubes and wires. I felt like I was drowning, but on dry land. The fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I don't remember much after that. I woke up in the ICU days later. They told me I'd been on a ventilator. I felt so weak, so vulnerable. It was like my body had betrayed me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're very strong.",
    "Client: The recovery was slow and painful. Every day was a struggle. I had to learn to breathe properly again, to eat, to move. I felt like a burden to everyone around me.",
    "Therapist: You're not a burden. You're resilient.",
    "Client: (sighs) It's still hard to think about. The fear of it happening again never really goes away. Sometimes, when I have trouble sleeping at night, those memories come flooding back.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I'm trying to focus on the fact that I survived, that I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but also... lighter, I suppose. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today."
