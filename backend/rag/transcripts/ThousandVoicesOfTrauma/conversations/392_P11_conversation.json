    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving the moment when I found out about my partner's terminal diagnosis... it's still so raw, you know? I can feel my heart racing, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in that sterile hospital room, hearing those words all over again.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The silence. After the doctor spoke, there was this deafening silence. I remember thinking, \"This can't be real.\" I could hear the clock ticking on the wall, and it felt like time just... stopped. And then the rush of emotions hit me all at once. Fear, anger, disbelief... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My hands were shaking. I noticed I was clenching my jaw so tightly it started to hurt. And I felt this wave of nausea, just like I did that day. It's amazing how vivid these physical sensations are, even now.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts went through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"We had so many plans. This isn't fair.\" And then guilt hit me because I was thinking about myself when my partner was the one facing... facing death. I felt selfish and scared and completely unprepared for what was coming.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I still struggle with that feeling of helplessness. Whenever something goes wrong, even small things, I immediately catastrophize. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. And that guilt... it's still there. I feel guilty for moving on, for having good days.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I realized that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Reliving that moment was incredibly painful, but I got through it. And maybe... maybe I can start to forgive myself for those initial selfish thoughts. I was in shock, after all.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be a bit kinder to myself. Maybe I can start to recognize when I'm catastrophizing and remind myself that I've survived difficult things before. And perhaps I can work on accepting that it's okay to have good days, that it doesn't mean I've forgotten or stopped caring.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I could... maybe I could start a gratitude journal? Just jot down one good thing each day without feeling guilty about it. It might help me focus on the present more instead of constantly dreading the future.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, honestly. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I've set down a heavy weight I've been carrying. It's still there, but maybe it's a little lighter now.",
    "Therapist: You've done important work today. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think I need some time to just... be. Maybe go for a walk, get some fresh air. Process everything we've talked about. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care of yourself. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. This isn't easy, but I'm grateful for your guidance. I'll see you next week."
