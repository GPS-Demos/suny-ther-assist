    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that memory of being imprisoned during my medical treatment... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to push down for so long.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. Being strapped to that hospital bed, unable to move or communicate properly... it was like being trapped in my own body. The doctors and nurses were talking about me as if I wasn't even there. I felt so... dehumanized.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly distressing.",
    "Client: It was. I keep replaying the moment when they were discussing my treatment options. I wanted to scream, to tell them I could hear everything, but I couldn't make a sound. It's like... it's like I was a prisoner in my own skin.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that same panic rising in my chest. But... but there was something different this time. I knew I was here, in this room with you, and that I was safe. It didn't make the memory less painful, but it felt... I don't know, more manageable somehow?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How do you think this relates to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I... I guess it shows me that maybe I'm not as trapped by these memories as I thought. Don't get me wrong, they're still terrifying. But being able to go through it and come out the other side... it makes me wonder if I can do that with other aspects of my life too. Maybe I don't have to let this control me forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this impact your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've been so afraid of medical settings since then. I've avoided check-ups, dentist appointments, everything. But if I can face this memory head-on, maybe... maybe I can start taking small steps towards reclaiming that part of my life. It won't be easy, but I think I want to try.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to engage is commendable. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to keep working on this. Maybe we could... could we try focusing on some of the specific moments that scare me the most? Like when they were discussing my prognosis. I know it'll be hard, but I feel like if I can face that, I can face anything.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. How are you feeling about continuing?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel. It's dim, and it's far away, but it's there. And that... that means everything to me right now.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is remarkable. Any final thoughts on today's session?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. For helping me see that I'm not as powerless as I thought. It's a long road ahead, but I feel like I've taken my first real step today. And that's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength today. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to it. It won't be easy, but I think I'm ready to keep facing this. One step at a time, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. One step at a time. See you next week."
