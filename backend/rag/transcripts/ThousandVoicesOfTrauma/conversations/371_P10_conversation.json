    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm alright, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the accident again, and that always makes me feel a bit uneasy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. Where are you now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 or 5. Not too bad, but definitely feeling some tension.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* It's a sunny afternoon. I'm driving home from work, feeling pretty good about a project I just finished. The radio's on, playing some old school R&B. I remember thinking about what to make for dinner...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the road ahead, it's clear. There's a line of trees on the right side. The dashboard of my car, the steering wheel under my hands. It all seems so normal, you know? Like any other day...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see a car in my rearview mirror. It's coming up fast, weaving between lanes. I remember thinking, \"This guy's going to cause an accident.\" And then... *voice shakes* it all happens so quickly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear screeching tires. A loud crash. Glass breaking. And then... screaming. So much screaming. *breathing quickens*",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7 now. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* The car that was speeding, it hits another car. They both spin out of control. One of them slams into the guardrail, the other... *pause* the other one flips. It's rolling towards me. I'm hitting the brakes, trying to swerve, but it's all happening so fast.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Pure terror. My hands are clenched on the wheel. I can't breathe. I'm thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The car misses me by inches. I feel the rush of air as it passes. I'm slamming on the brakes, skidding to a stop. There's debris everywhere. I can smell burning rubber, gasoline. *voice trembles* And then I see them. The people in the flipped car. They're not moving.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I get out of my car. My legs are shaking so badly I can barely stand. I'm fumbling for my phone, calling 911. I can hear other people shouting, some are crying. I'm trying to get to the flipped car, but someone stops me. They're saying it might explode.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, James?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Scared. Angry. Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't I do more? *starts to cry*",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm standing there, watching. The police arrive, then ambulances. There's so much noise - sirens, people talking, crying. I see them pulling people from the cars. Some are moving, others... *voice breaks* others aren't.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"That could have been me.\" I'm shaking, I can't stop. A policeman comes to talk to me, but I can barely focus on what he's saying. I keep looking at the wreckage, the people being loaded into ambulances. The smell of smoke and gasoline is making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense it hurts. My stomach is in knots. I feel like I can't get enough air. My hands won't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe, James. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* It's like I'm there again. I can see it all so clearly. The broken glass glittering on the road, the twisted metal, the... the blood. *voice cracks* There's blood on the pavement.",
    "Therapist: What happens after that?",
    "Client: They... they ask me some questions. Take my statement. But I feel like I'm not really there. Like I'm watching it all happen from outside my body. They tell me I can go home, but... *pauses* but I don't want to drive. I can't. I call my wife to come get me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're waiting?",
    "Client: Lost. Shaken. I keep replaying it in my mind, over and over. Wondering if I could have done something differently. If I could have helped somehow. I feel guilty for being okay when others... when others weren't.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high. Maybe a 7. My heart's still racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: When my wife arrives, I... I break down. I'm sobbing in her arms right there on the side of the road. I can't even explain what happened. She's scared, confused. I can see the wreckage being cleared behind her. It feels surreal, like a nightmare I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you leave the scene?",
    "Client: We drive home in silence. I can't talk about it yet. I keep flinching at every car that passes us. When we get home, I go straight to the shower. I stand under the hot water for... I don't know how long. Trying to wash away the memory, the smell, the feeling. But it doesn't work.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel once you're home?",
    "Client: Numb. Exhausted. But I can't relax. Every time I close my eyes, I see it all again. The cars spinning, the screams, the blood. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I keep checking the news, looking for updates on the people involved.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: *opens eyes, looks around* I see... the blue chair you're sitting in. The plant in the corner. The clock on the wall. The bookshelf. And the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, three things you hear?",
    "Client: I hear the air conditioning humming. Cars passing outside. And... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit calmer. Still shaky, but... better. It's like the memory loses some of its power when I talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You did very well today, James. How would you rate your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 4 now. It's still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, it's normal for these memories to be distressing. But each time we work through them, they become more manageable. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I feel like I'm starting to process it better. Like I'm not just trapped in that moment anymore. It's still painful, but I can talk about it now without feeling like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, James. We'll continue to work on this. For now, let's end with some relaxation exercises to help you transition out of this memory.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I think this is helping. It's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's begin the relaxation exercise..."
