    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's tough, you know? Reliving that home invasion... it brings back all those feelings of helplessness and fear. I keep seeing their faces, hearing the sound of breaking glass. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The smell. I never realized how vivid that memory of the intruders' cologne was. It's like it's stuck in my nostrils even now. And the way my heart was pounding... I could feel it in my throat. It's amazing how real it all feels, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does it compare to when you usually think about it?",
    "Client: It's... clearer, I guess. Usually, it's more fragmented, like flashes. But going through it step-by-step like this, it's more coherent. It's harder in some ways, but... I don't know, maybe it's good to face it head-on?",
    "Therapist: What makes you say that?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it. Drinking to numb myself, you know? But that hasn't really helped. It's still there, haunting me. Maybe... maybe confronting it is the only way to truly move past it.",
    "Therapist: How did you manage the anxiety during the exposure?",
    "Client: It was tough at first. My hands were shaking, and I felt that familiar urge for a drink. But I tried those breathing exercises we practiced. They helped a bit. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory... it didn't make the fear go away, but it made it more bearable.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I faced it. I didn't run away or try to numb it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What did you learn about yourself?",
    "Client: (pauses, reflecting) I guess... I'm stronger than I thought. I've been carrying this fear for so long, thinking I couldn't handle facing it. But I did. It was hard, but I did it. And maybe... maybe that means I can handle more than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, it's making me think about my drinking. If I can face this memory without alcohol, maybe I can face other things too. Maybe I don't need to numb myself all the time. It's scary to think about, but... maybe it's possible.",
    "Therapist: What would that look like for you?",
    "Client: (sighs) I don't know, exactly. Taking each day as it comes, I suppose. Trying to deal with things head-on instead of hiding from them. Maybe... maybe even reaching out to my kids again. I've pushed them away for so long because I was ashamed of my drinking, of how I've been living. But if I can face this, maybe I can face them too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, if I'm honest. But... I think I need to. I'm tired of living in fear, of letting my past control me. I want to reclaim my life, you know? It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to start attending those AA meetings we talked about. And maybe... maybe it's time I consider some medication for my anxiety. I've been resistant, but if it can help me stay on this path... And, um, I hope we can keep working together like this. It helps, having someone to guide me through it all.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: (shakes head) No, I think... I think that's enough for today. It's a lot to process. But thank you, really. For the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this very long tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try. See you next week."
