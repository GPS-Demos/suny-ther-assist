    "Therapist: Alright, Priya, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the day of the animal attack.",
    "Client: It was a sunny afternoon. I was walking in the park near my house. The trees were casting long shadows, and I could hear children playing in the distance. Suddenly, I heard growling behind me. I turned and saw a large dog, teeth bared, running towards me. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I can feel my heart beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me, and I tried to back away, but I tripped and fell. I could feel its hot breath on my face as it snapped at me. I raised my arms to protect myself, and that's when it bit into my forearm. The pain was excruciating, and I screamed. I can still hear my own screams echoing in my ears.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) The dog kept biting and shaking my arm. I thought it was going to tear it off. I could feel warm blood running down my skin. I was crying and screaming for help, but it felt like an eternity before anyone came. The pain was overwhelming, and I was terrified that the dog would go for my throat next.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My arm is actually aching now, as if it's happening again. I feel so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, I heard people shouting and running towards us. The dog was pulled off me, but I couldn't move. I just lay there, sobbing and shaking. Someone was talking to me, trying to calm me down, but all I could focus on was the throbbing pain in my arm and the fear that the dog might come back.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrived, and the paramedics started treating my wounds. I remember feeling so exposed and vulnerable, lying there with my torn clothes and bloody arm. People were staring, and I felt so ashamed, even though I knew it wasn't my fault. The ride to the hospital was a blur of pain and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. My breathing is a bit easier, but I still feel on edge.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: At the hospital, they cleaned and stitched my wounds. The doctor said I was lucky it wasn't worse. But all I could think about was how unlucky I was that it happened at all. I had nightmares for weeks after, always waking up in a cold sweat, feeling the phantom pain in my arm.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 5. Talking about it, I realize that I survived. I'm here, and I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... stronger, I guess. Like I can face this memory without being consumed by it. It's still scary, but it doesn't have the same hold on me as before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's wrap up. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today, Priya. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but proud of myself. I didn't think I could get through that without falling apart. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll end here for today."
