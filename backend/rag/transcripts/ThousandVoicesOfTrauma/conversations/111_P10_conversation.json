    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Thompson. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My hands are shaking a little. It's been so long since I've talked about the crash.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed... yes, I think I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm at the airport. It's early morning, maybe 6 AM. The sun is just starting to come up. I can smell coffee from the nearby caf\u00e9. My grandson, Miguel... he's holding my hand. He's so excited for his first plane ride.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're boarding now. Miguel is bouncing up and down, pointing at everything. \"Abuela, look at the wings! Look how big they are!\" I smile at him, but... but I feel a knot in my stomach. Something doesn't feel right.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: We're in our seats now. Miguel is by the window, I'm in the middle, and my daughter Elena is on the aisle. The plane starts to move, and I... I grip the armrests. My palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you notice as the plane takes off?",
    "Client: It's... it's loud. So loud. Miguel is laughing, but I can barely hear him. We're climbing higher and higher. I close my eyes and start praying silently. \"Dios m\u00edo, protect us...\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you feel?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. And then... then there's a sudden jolt. The plane shakes violently. People start screaming. I... I can't breathe. (voice breaking)",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Maria. Take a deep breath. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: (shakily) It's... it's an 80. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Focus on my voice. You're here in the office, not on that plane.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: (after a pause) The oxygen masks drop down. Everything is chaos. I'm fumbling with Miguel's mask, trying to get it on him. He's crying now, scared. Elena is yelling something, but I can't hear her over the alarms and the screaming.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: People are panicking. Some are praying, others are holding onto each other. The flight attendants are trying to calm everyone, but their faces... they look terrified too. And then... then we start to drop. Fast.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I pull Miguel close to me. I can feel his little body shaking. I'm whispering, \"It's okay, mi amor. Abuela's here.\" But I know... I know it's not okay. The plane is falling, and I can't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I feel helpless. Terrified. My whole body is tense, like I'm bracing for impact all over again.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. (voice trembling)",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember, you're here with me, safe in the office.",
    "Client: (nodding) Right... right. I'm here. (takes a deep breath) We're descending so fast. The pressure in my ears is painful. I can see trees through Miguel's window, getting closer and closer. Elena grabs my hand, and I look at her. Her eyes... they're full of fear, but also love. She mouths \"I love you,\" and I... I try to say it back, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's a deafening noise. Metal scraping, people screaming. I hold Miguel tighter, trying to shield him. And then... impact. It's like being hit by a truck, over and over. I'm thrown forward, but the seatbelt holds me back. My head snaps forward, then back. Everything goes dark for a moment.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Maria. You're doing well. What's the next thing you remember?",
    "Client: Smoke. The smell of fuel. I... I open my eyes, and everything's sideways. Miguel is limp in my arms. I try to shake him, to wake him up, but he... he doesn't move. (sobbing) My baby... my poor baby...",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. You're very brave for facing this. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can, Maria. You're stronger than you know. Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: (breathing slowly) Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I look over at Elena. She's slumped in her seat, not moving. There's blood... so much blood. I try to reach for her, but my arm won't move. It hurts so much. People are screaming, crying. I can hear the crackle of flames.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my fingers won't work right. I'm dizzy, everything's spinning. I keep calling out to Miguel, to Elena, but they don't answer. I can hear people outside the plane, shouting. Sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: Someone... a man, I think... he's there suddenly. He's cutting my seatbelt. Telling me it'll be okay. But I know it's not okay. Nothing will ever be okay again. He's pulling me out, and I'm screaming. \"My family! My family!\" But he just keeps pulling me away from the plane.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you're taken away from the plane?",
    "Client: I... I can see the wreckage. It doesn't even look like a plane anymore. Just twisted metal and flames. They put me on a stretcher. There are people everywhere - paramedics, firefighters. I keep trying to get up, to go back, but they won't let me. I'm yelling in Spanish, in English, begging them to save Miguel and Elena. But deep down... deep down I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Maria?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Empty. Like everything that mattered was left behind in that wreckage.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 90? But it's different now. More... numb.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Maria. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see your bookshelf. The green plant in the corner. And... and the clock on your desk.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've shown tremendous courage today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60, I think. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. We'll end our session here for today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: It was hard... really hard. But I think... I think it might be helping. Poco a poco, as we say. Little by little.",
    "Therapist: That's right, Maria. Little by little. We'll continue next week. Take care of yourself.",
    "Client: Gracias, Dr. Thompson. I'll try."
