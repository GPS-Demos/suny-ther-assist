    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? The screeching tires, the impact... God, it was so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe it's more like... anxiety? It's this tight feeling in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. And there's this underlying sense of... I don't know, helplessness maybe? Like I'm not in control.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being trapped. In the car, in the memory, in this cycle of fear. I keep thinking about how quickly everything happened. One moment I was driving home, thinking about what to make for dinner, and the next... chaos. I couldn't do anything to stop it. And now, even though I know I'm safe here, part of me still feels stuck in that moment of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experiences?",
    "Client: I... hmm. You know, it's not that different from how I felt during my time in the service. That constant state of alertness, never knowing when something might happen. Always feeling like you need to be ready, but also knowing that sometimes, no matter how prepared you are, you can't control everything. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy. And I just realized I've been clenching my jaw this whole time. There's tension in my shoulders too, like I'm bracing for impact. It's... it's funny, in a way. My body remembers even when I try to forget.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to when you're not discussing the trauma?",
    "Client: Oh, it's night and day. Usually, I can keep it all under wraps, you know? I go about my day, and I'm fine. But when we do these exercises, or when something triggers a memory... it all comes flooding back. The tension, the racing heart, the sweaty palms. It's like my body goes into full alert mode.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why can't I just get over this?\" Part of me feels angry at myself for still being affected by it all. I've been through worse, you know? But then another part of me is saying, \"It's okay to still be processing this.\" It's like there's a battle in my head between the tough soldier I used to be and the person I am now, trying to heal.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging these feelings impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. Talking about it, really diving into these feelings... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of trying to push it away. There's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe if I can face this, I can eventually move past it.",
    "Therapist: What does that hope feel like?",
    "Client: It's like a tiny spark of warmth in my chest. Just a glimmer, really, but it's there. It's... it's reminding me of why I'm doing this. Why I'm putting myself through these difficult sessions. Because maybe, just maybe, there's a life on the other side of this where I'm not constantly on guard, where I can feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: How does this hope relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I suppose it's what keeps me going. There are days when it all feels too much, when I want to give up and just accept that this is how I'll always be. But then I remember moments like this, where I can talk about it without completely falling apart. It's progress, isn't it? Slow, painful progress, but progress nonetheless. And that gives me the strength to keep trying, to keep coming back here and facing these memories.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've learned that... I'm stronger than I thought. Not in the way I used to think of strength, all stoic and unyielding. But in my ability to face these memories, to feel these intense emotions and still keep going. It's a different kind of resilience, I guess. And maybe... maybe that's okay. Maybe that's exactly what I need to get through this.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Drained, definitely. These sessions always take a lot out of me. But also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? Like I've set down a heavy pack I've been carrying. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but for now, it feels good to have shared some of that weight. And I'm grateful, you know? For this space, for your guidance. It's not easy, but I think... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I feel like we've covered a lot today. I'm tired, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important, even if it was hard. I'm looking forward to going home and just... being. Maybe do some of those grounding exercises we talked about. Yeah, I think I'm good for now.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's end here for today. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
