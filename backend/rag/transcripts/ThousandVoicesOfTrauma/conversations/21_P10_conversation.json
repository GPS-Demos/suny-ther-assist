    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a lot on my mind. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by describing where you were when the event began.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in the barracks. It's early morning, still dark outside. The air is heavy, humid. I can smell the dampness of the jungle...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're getting ready for a patrol. I'm checking my gear, making sure everything's in order. My hands are shaking slightly... I'm nervous about what we might encounter out there.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 40? The anticipation is building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: We're moving out now. The jungle is thick, oppressive. Every sound makes me jumpy. I'm near the front of the patrol, scanning for any signs of movement. My heart's racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm sweating, but it's not just from the heat. There's this constant fear... (voice trembles) Oh God, I remember this feeling so vividly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What's happening now?",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) We've been walking for hours. Suddenly, there's a crack of gunfire. Everything explodes into chaos. I dive for cover, my ears ringing...",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70, maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what you see?",
    "Client: I see... flashes of light, muzzle flares in the darkness. The air is filled with smoke and the smell of gunpowder. I'm firing back, but I can't see the enemy. It's just noise and confusion...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. My whole body is shaking. I can't think straight. I just keep firing, praying I'll make it through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear screaming. One of our guys is hit. I want to help him, but I can't move. I'm frozen... (starts breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out...",
    "Client: (follows breathing) Okay... okay... I'm still there, but... I'm trying to stay calm.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever. Eventually, it starts to die down. We're calling out, checking who's okay. I'm alive, but... God, the guilt. Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you describe the aftermath?",
    "Client: The jungle is eerily quiet now. The sun's starting to come up, casting this surreal light through the trees. We're assessing casualties, calling for medevac. The smell of blood mixes with the jungle air... it's sickening.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm helping with the wounded. My hands are steady now, operating on autopilot. But inside, I feel hollow, numb. Like a part of me died in that firefight.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're helping?",
    "Client: Tense. Every muscle is coiled, ready to spring. My senses are hyper-alert, scanning for any threat. But there's also this deep exhaustion setting in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The helicopters arrive. The whump-whump of the rotors fills the air. We're loading the wounded, and I'm... I'm looking at their faces. Young men, boys really. Some I know, some I don't. But they all look the same now - scared, in pain, changed forever.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This isn't what I signed up for.\" I feel angry, betrayed somehow. But also... guilty for feeling that way. These men need me to be strong.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens as you leave the area?",
    "Client: We're heading back to base. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I'm starting to shake again. I can't stop replaying the firefight in my head. Every sound makes me flinch. I feel... I feel broken.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Right... I'm here. I'm safe. But... it's hard to shake off those feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We arrive back at base. Everything looks the same, but it all feels different. I'm debriefed, but I can barely focus. My mind keeps drifting back to the jungle, to the men we lost...",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to shut down. I throw myself into my duties, anything to keep busy. But at night, the memories come flooding back. I can't sleep. When I do, I have nightmares.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 65. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. How does this experience affect you in the days that follow?",
    "Client: I'm on edge all the time. Jumpy. I can't relax. I start to withdraw from my fellow soldiers. I feel... different. Like I can't connect with them anymore. And the guilt... it eats away at me.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How do you see this event impacting your life long-term?",
    "Client: It... it changes everything. Even after I come home, I can't shake it. Loud noises, crowds, they all set me off. I push people away, including my family. I feel like no one can understand what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling now, talking about all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, release? Like I'm finally letting some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your current distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. Still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised, actually. It was tough, but... I feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what this process is about. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's a lot to process. But I think... I think this might be helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll end our session here. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for listening, for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next session."
