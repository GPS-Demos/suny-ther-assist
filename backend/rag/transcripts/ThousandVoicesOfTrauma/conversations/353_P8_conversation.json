    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of foggy. My heart is still pounding a bit. That memory... it's so vivid, you know? I can still hear the shouting, see the fear in my mom's eyes. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger. Definitely anger. But also... helplessness? I remember feeling so small, so powerless. I wanted to do something, anything to make it stop. But I couldn't. I was just a kid, frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like this heavy weight in my chest. My shoulders feel tense, like I'm still bracing for something. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's... it's exhausting, honestly.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why didn't I do more? I know, logically, that I was just a child. But there's this voice in my head saying I should have protected my mom somehow. And then I feel guilty for not being able to. It's like this cycle I can't break out of.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way before. But I guess... I'm always trying to be in control. At work, at home. I have a hard time letting go, trusting others. Maybe it's because I felt so out of control back then? And the guilt... it's like I'm constantly trying to make up for something, even when it's not my responsibility.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my relationships. With my wife, my kids. I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. It's like I'm still that scared little boy sometimes, you know? But I don't want to be. I want to be present, to enjoy my family without this... this cloud hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that impact?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet, I guess? On one hand, it's painful to see how much this has shaped me. But on the other, it's kind of liberating. Like maybe understanding it is the first step to changing it. I don't want my past to control my future anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a very hopeful perspective. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I need to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, now, not back there. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to that scared little boy inside me. He did the best he could with what he had.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a compassionate approach. How can we support that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, exactly. Maybe... maybe we could work on some ways for me to ground myself when these memories come up? And... I think I want to explore more about how this has affected my relationships. I want to be more present, more open with my family.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. It's scary, but also kind of exciting. I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just sit with this feeling. To acknowledge how far I've come, even if there's still a long way to go. And maybe... maybe to thank that little boy for surviving, for getting me here. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take that moment together.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Thank you. This... this means a lot to me. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I'm also... hopeful? Yeah, hopeful. That's new.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. We'll continue this journey together next time."
