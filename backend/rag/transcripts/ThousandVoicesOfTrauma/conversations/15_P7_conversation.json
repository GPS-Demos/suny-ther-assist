    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the bullying incident during your illness?",
    "Client: Okay... I was 15, in the hospital with pneumonia. I'd been there for a week, and I was feeling really weak. My classmate, Jake, came to visit. I thought he was being nice, but...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He started making fun of how I looked. Said I was pathetic, lying there like a \"useless lump.\" He took pictures of me, saying he'd show everyone at school how gross I was. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. It's like I'm back there, struggling to breathe with the pneumonia. Jake's laughing, telling me I'm weak, that I'll never catch up in school. I want to yell at him, but I can't even speak...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I'm so angry and scared. I keep thinking about how everyone at school will see those pictures, how they'll laugh at me. I feel so alone, so vulnerable. The machines are beeping, and Jake's just there, mocking me...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I can't. This is too much. I feel like I'm suffocating all over again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here, in a safe place.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... I'm here. It's just... the memory is so vivid. I can smell the hospital, feel the scratchy sheets. Jake's voice is so clear in my head, calling me names, threatening to show everyone how weak I am.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He... he took more pictures. Said he'd make a slideshow for the whole school. I was crying, but I couldn't wipe my tears. I felt so exposed, so violated. And all the while, I'm struggling to breathe, feeling like I'm drowning in my own lungs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My palms are sweaty. I feel a mix of rage and shame. I want to punch Jake, but I also want to hide. I keep thinking about how this affected me for years after, how I dreaded going back to school, how I felt like everyone was always laughing at me behind my back.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these reactions. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: Thank you... It's hard, but... I guess it helps to talk about it. To remember that I'm not that helpless kid anymore. But part of me still feels so angry, so hurt. Like I'll never fully get over what Jake did.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's... it's exhausting to relive this. But I think I understand now why we're doing this. It's like... facing the memory head-on makes it a little less scary each time. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let out some of the poison that's been inside me for years. It still hurts, but... I don't feel as overwhelmed by it as I did before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here for today."
