    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Knowing we're going to delve into my combat experience has my stomach in knots. But I'm here, and I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe that day.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... It's hot. Unbearably hot. The sun is beating down on us as we patrol through this small village. The air is thick with dust, and I can taste it on my tongue. My uniform is sticking to me, and the weight of my gear feels extra heavy today. I'm on high alert, my eyes scanning every window, every doorway... (pauses)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you see next?",
    "Client: I see... children. They're playing in the street, kicking a ball around. It almost feels normal for a moment. But then I notice how they stop and stare as we pass by. Their eyes... they look so old for such young faces. I remember thinking how wrong that was...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... sad. Angry. These kids should be carefree, but instead, they're growing up in a war zone. It's not right. (voice wavers) And then... then I hear it. A loud crack, like a firecracker, but I know better. \"Sniper!\" someone yells, and suddenly everything is chaos.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay... We're all scrambling for cover. I dive behind a low wall, my rifle ready. The kids are screaming, running in all directions. I want to help them, but I can't move. I'm pinned down. The sound of gunfire is deafening, and I can smell the acrid scent of smoke and gunpowder.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see one of the boys trip and fall in the middle of the street. He's crying, terrified. Without thinking, I leap out from behind the wall. I can hear my squadmates yelling at me to get back, but I can't leave him there. I run, faster than I've ever run in my life. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely hear anything else.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: I reach the boy, scoop him up in my arms. He's so small, so light. I turn to run back to cover, and that's when I feel it. A searing pain in my leg. I've been hit. But I don't stop. I can't. I stumble, nearly fall, but somehow I make it back behind the wall. I set the boy down, and he scrambles away to safety. That's when the pain really hits me. (winces)",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I can almost feel the pain in my leg again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the office. You're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Right. I'm here. I'm safe. (pauses) The memory... it's so vivid. I can still hear the gunfire, smell the blood. My squadmate is putting pressure on my wound, yelling for a medic. I'm dizzy, everything's starting to blur. But all I can think about is that boy. Did he make it? Is he safe?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts and feelings.",
    "Client: I feel... guilty. Relieved that I saved him, but guilty that I couldn't do more. And scared. So scared. I thought I was going to die there, in that dusty street. (voice breaks) I didn't want to die. I wanted to go home, to see my family again. (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're doing really well. What happens after that?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. I remember being loaded onto a helicopter. The pain was excruciating, but the noise of the rotors almost drowned it out. I kept fading in and out of consciousness. I remember thinking about my husband, my kids. I was so afraid I'd never see them again. (wipes tears)",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out finally.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. Let's take a few moments to breathe and center ourselves.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe. It's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. Can you tell me one thing you're proud of from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I saved that boy. Despite everything, despite the danger and my fear, I saved him. I did something good in the middle of all that horror.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Bittersweet, but good. Like maybe all the pain and trauma wasn't for nothing.",
    "Therapist: That's an important perspective. As we wrap up, how are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm tired, really tired. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced this memory and survived it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly right. You did face it, and you did survive. You've shown incredible courage today. Let's end with some grounding exercises before you leave.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You did the hard work here. We'll continue to process this in our next session. For now, let's focus on bringing you fully back to the present."
