    "Therapist: Okay, John. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the home invasion.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in bed, it's around 2 AM. I hear a crash downstairs. My heart starts racing immediately. I'm instantly alert, like I'm back in combat. I quietly get out of bed, careful not to wake my wife. As I reach for the baseball bat by the door, I hear footsteps on the stairs.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Uh, about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The footsteps are getting closer. I'm gripping the bat so tight my knuckles are white. I'm sweating, my mouth is dry. I position myself behind the door, ready to strike. The door handle turns slowly...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I can almost smell the fear, you know? It's like being back in Iraq. SUDS is probably an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The door opens, and I see a shadow. Without thinking, I swing the bat. There's a cry of pain, and I realize... it's my teenage son. He'd snuck out and was coming back in. I... I hurt my own kid.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: God, it's a 9. I feel sick remembering this.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're brave for facing this. What happened next?",
    "Client: I dropped the bat. My son's on the floor, holding his arm. My wife turns on the light. She's screaming. I'm frozen, can't move. Can't believe what I've done. I'm shaking, feeling like the worst father in the world.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I can't... it's hard to breathe thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... The next few hours are a blur. Hospital, x-rays, my son's arm is broken. He won't look at me. My wife is crying. I feel like a monster.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 7 now. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The guilt. It was overwhelming. I couldn't sleep for days. Kept reliving that moment, seeing my son's face when he realized it was me who hit him. The fear in his eyes... it haunts me.",

    "Client: It's a 5. I feel drained, but... lighter, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done great work today, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard, but I think this is helping.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. You're safe now."
