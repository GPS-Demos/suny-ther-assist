    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is shaking on the inside, but I'm completely still on the outside. The memory of that dog attack... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the growling, you know? It's like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... shame? I keep thinking about how I froze. I was just a kid, but I feel like I should have done something, anything. It's like I'm reliving that helplessness all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness manifest for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. I feel small, you know? Like I'm that little boy again, cowering in the corner of our backyard. My heart's racing, and I'm having trouble catching my breath. It's ridiculous, isn't it? I'm a grown man now, but I feel so... vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know others have been through worse. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm somehow... broken. Like that day changed something fundamental in me, and I'll never be whole again.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to other areas of your life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere, really. I'm always on edge, especially around dogs. But it's more than that. I struggle to trust people, to let them get close. I'm always waiting for something bad to happen, you know? It's exhausting. And in my relationships, I... I have a hard time being vulnerable. It's like I'm still that scared kid, trying to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense they're practically up to my ears. My stomach feels like it's in knots. And there's this... this tightness in my throat, like I'm trying to hold back tears or a scream. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that scared child if you could?",
    "Client: I... (long pause) I'd tell him it's not his fault. That he's brave for surviving, for getting through it. That he doesn't have to be strong all the time, that it's okay to be scared. And that... that he's not alone. God, I wish someone had told me that back then.",
    "Therapist: How does saying that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. There's a part of me that feels lighter, like I'm letting go of something I've been carrying for so long. But there's also this deep sadness. For that little boy, for all the years I've spent beating myself up over this. It's like... like I'm mourning for the childhood I lost that day.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to breathe. Just... just sit with these feelings for a bit. It's uncomfortable, but it feels important, you know? Like I'm finally facing something I've been running from for years. And maybe... maybe I need to be a bit kinder to myself. It's just... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What else is coming up for you?",
    "Client: There's this... this glimmer of hope, I guess? Like maybe by facing this, by really looking at it, I can start to move past it. It's terrifying, but also... I don't know, liberating in a way? Like I'm taking back some control. I've spent so long trying to avoid anything that reminds me of that day, but maybe... maybe that's not the answer.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I'll be less jumpy, less anxious all the time. Maybe I can start to trust people more, to let them in. It's scary to think about, but also exciting. Like, what if I could walk down the street without constantly scanning for danger? What if I could actually enjoy a day at the park without panicking every time I see a dog? It seems impossible, but... but maybe it's not.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could try to be more open with my partner about this. I've always kept it bottled up, you know? Maybe... maybe talking about it more could help. And maybe... maybe I could try some relaxation techniques when I feel that panic rising. It's not much, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about these potential changes?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's fear, definitely. Change is scary, and this... this is big. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe I don't have to be defined by this trauma forever. It's like I can see a glimmer of light at the end of a very long, very dark tunnel. It's overwhelming, but in a different way than before. More... more hopeful, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need patience. From myself, from my partner, from you. This isn't going to change overnight, and I need to remember that. And maybe... maybe some tools to help me when things get tough. Breathing exercises, grounding techniques, that sort of thing. And... and I think I need to keep talking about it. As hard as it is, I feel like it helps, you know?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But it's a different kind of tired. Like I've run a marathon or something. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced something really difficult and come out the other side. I'm still scared, still anxious, but it feels... manageable somehow. Like maybe, just maybe, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how this trauma has affected my relationships. Especially with my partner. I've kept them at arm's length for so long, and I... I think I'm ready to start changing that. It's scary, but... but I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I think. A bit raw, like I've been scrubbed clean from the inside out. But also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying for years. It's strange, but... but good. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
