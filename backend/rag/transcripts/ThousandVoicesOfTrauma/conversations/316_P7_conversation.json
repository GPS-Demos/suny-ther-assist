    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Are you ready to revisit the memory of the animal attack?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's still hard to think about, but I'll try.",
    "Therapist: You're brave for doing this. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the beach. It's a beautiful day, and I decided to go for a swim. The water is cool and refreshing. I'm enjoying the waves when suddenly... I feel something brush against my leg.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: At first, I think it's just seaweed, but then... oh God, I see the fin. It's a shark. My heart starts racing, and I'm frozen with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The shark circles me, and I can't move. I'm terrified it's going to attack at any moment. I try to stay still, hoping it will lose interest, but it keeps getting closer.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Suddenly, it lunges at me. I feel a sharp pain in my leg as its teeth sink in. I scream, but I'm so far from shore. The water around me turns red, and I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to hit the shark on its nose, and it lets go. I start swimming towards the shore as fast as I can, my leg burning with pain. I'm crying and gasping for air, terrified it will come back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: As I reach the shallows, people on the beach see me and rush to help. I collapse on the sand, shaking and sobbing. The pain is excruciating, and I'm in shock.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving it is so intense. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit nauseous.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did exceptionally well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I know it's important to face this. I just... I still feel so vulnerable when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It's strange, but talking about it... it feels a little less overwhelming each time.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am, in a way. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe in the water again.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're making great strides.",
    "Client: I hope so. This therapy is helping, even though it's difficult. I'm starting to understand my reactions better.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. So, after they got me to the hospital...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The doctors were amazing. They treated my wounds and started me on antibiotics immediately. I needed surgery to repair some of the damage to my leg. The whole time, I kept replaying the attack in my mind.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to do that. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes it feels so real. The recovery was long and painful. Physical therapy was challenging, and I had nightmares for months.",
    "Therapist: You've come so far. Keep going.",
    "Client: The hardest part was dealing with the fear afterward. I couldn't even look at pictures of the ocean without panicking. It affected my whole life - I couldn't enjoy beach trips with my family anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're working through this.",
    "Client: It's been a long journey. I'm still working on it, but I've made progress. Last month, I managed to put my feet in the ocean. It was terrifying, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I'm trying to focus on how far I've come rather than how far I still have to go.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. How do you feel now?",

    "Client: I am. It's been a difficult journey, but I'm starting to see a future where this doesn't control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your support through this process. It's making a real difference.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel drained, but in a positive way, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it will be challenging.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Take care until next time."
