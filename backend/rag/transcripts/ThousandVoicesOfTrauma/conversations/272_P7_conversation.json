    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the memory we've been working on.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm 12 years old, and I'm in the compound where our cult lived. It's early morning, and I can smell incense burning. The leader has called for a special ceremony, and everyone's gathering in the main hall. I'm feeling nervous because these ceremonies can be unpredictable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I walk into the hall, I see everyone dressed in white robes. The leader is at the front, his eyes intense and piercing. He starts chanting, and everyone joins in. I don't want to, but I know I have to. My heart is racing, and I feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The chanting gets louder, and suddenly the leader points at me. He says I've been chosen for a special blessing. I'm terrified. My parents are smiling, thinking this is an honor, but I want to run away. As I walk to the front, my legs feel heavy, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The leader puts his hands on my head, and everyone is staring at me. His touch feels cold and invasive. He starts speaking in tongues, and I can feel tears welling up in my eyes. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound. The room starts spinning, and I feel like I might faint.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Suddenly, he pushes me backward, and I fall into the arms of two adults behind me. They lower me to the ground, and I'm lying there, unable to move. The leader is shouting now, saying the spirits are cleansing me. I feel completely helpless and exposed. Everyone is watching, and I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, but was probably only minutes, the leader declares the ceremony complete. As I get up, my legs are wobbly, and I feel drained. My parents rush over, praising me for being chosen. But inside, I feel violated and confused. I don't understand why this happened to me or why everyone thinks it's a good thing. I just want to go back to my room and hide.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this difficult memory.",
    "Client: For days after, people in the compound treat me differently. They say I'm blessed, but I feel cursed. I have nightmares about the ceremony, and I'm constantly on edge, afraid it might happen again. I start to question everything about our life in the cult, but I'm too scared to say anything. It's like a part of me died that day, and I don't know how to get it back.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: As time goes on, I become more withdrawn. I start to have panic attacks, especially when the leader is nearby. I feel like I can't trust anyone, not even my parents. The compound, which once felt like home, now feels like a prison. I dream of escaping, but I'm terrified of the outside world too. It's like I'm trapped in a nightmare that I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: Years pass, and the memory of that day haunts me. It affects every relationship I have, every decision I make. Even now, decades later, I sometimes wake up in a cold sweat, feeling those hands on my head. It's hard to trust people, to feel safe in my own body. Sometimes I wonder who I would have been if that hadn't happened to me. Would I be less anxious? More trusting? It's like that one event shaped my entire life, and I'm still trying to break free from its grip.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also somewhat relieved. Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm finally acknowledging what happened to me. There's still a lot of pain and anger, but maybe also a glimmer of hope that I can work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today. You've done incredibly well."
