    "Therapist: Alright, John, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the car accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving home from work. It's late, around 9 PM. The roads are quiet. I can see the streetlights reflecting off the wet pavement. It had been raining earlier. I'm tired, thinking about getting home to my wife and kids...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4. I'm tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I see headlights in my rearview mirror. They're coming up fast. Too fast. My heart starts racing. I grip the steering wheel tighter. The car behind me is swerving... Oh God, it's going to hit me. I try to move over, but there's no time. The impact is deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. My car spins. I can't control it. I'm screaming, but I can't hear my own voice. Everything's a blur...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My hands are shaking. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: The car finally stops spinning. I'm upside down. The seatbelt is digging into my chest. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. My head is throbbing. I'm disoriented. I hear someone shouting, but it sounds far away. I try to move, but I'm stuck. I'm panicking, thinking about my family. What if I die here? What if I never see them again?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting louder. Someone's at my window, telling me help is coming. I'm crying, begging them to get me out. The pain is setting in now. My arm is twisted at an odd angle. I think it's broken. The wait feels like an eternity. I keep drifting in and out of consciousness...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's back down to an 8. My heart's still racing, but I feel a little calmer knowing help arrived.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The firefighters are working to cut me out of the car. The sound of the metal being torn apart is excruciating. It reminds me of... of the explosions in combat.

    "Therapist: John, stay with me. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there. In the car, in combat. It's all mixing together.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) Right... right. I'm here. I'm safe. (Pauses) They finally get me out of the car. I'm on a stretcher. The paramedics are talking to me, but I can barely focus. I'm in shock, I think. The pain is intense. As they load me into the ambulance, I see the other driver. He looks young, maybe early 20s. He's crying, saying he's sorry over and over. I feel a rush of anger, then guilt. It wasn't entirely his fault. The road was wet...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down to a 7. I feel drained, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You're doing really well, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's hard to talk about this. But I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Let's take a break here. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after exposure. Well done today, John."
