    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene when you witnessed the violence during your relationship breakup?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in our living room. It's evening, and I can hear the rain outside. My husband and I are arguing about his decision to leave. He's packing his things, and I'm pleading with him to stay. Suddenly, he turns and... (voice trembles) he throws a vase against the wall. The sound is so loud, and I can see the shattered pieces everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The look in his eyes... I've never seen him so angry. I'm frozen, my heart is racing. I can smell the flowers that were in the vase, mixed with the scent of rain coming through the open window. He's shouting at me, telling me it's over, that he can't take it anymore. I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm backing away, trying to create distance between us. My back hits the bookshelf, and I knock over a photo frame. The glass cracks, and I see our wedding picture lying there, broken. It's like a symbol of our relationship shattering before my eyes. I'm struggling to breathe, my chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here now.",
    "Client: He starts grabbing more things, throwing them into his suitcase. Books, clothes, everything. Each thud feels like a punch to my gut. I'm crying, begging him to stop, to talk to me. But it's like he can't even hear me anymore. I feel so invisible, so worthless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I remember sliding down to the floor, hugging my knees. The coldness of the hardwood seeps through my clothes. I'm shaking, both from fear and from crying so hard. He walks past me, dragging his suitcase. I reach out to grab his leg, one last desperate attempt to make him stay. He jerks away, and I fall forward, scraping my palms on the floor.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The door slams shut behind him. The sound echoes through the house, and then there's this deafening silence. I can hear my own ragged breathing, the ticking of the clock on the wall. I'm alone, surrounded by the mess, the broken pieces of our life together. I feel hollow, like something's been ripped out of me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is pounding, and my hands are clammy. It's like I'm reliving it all over again. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I've finally let out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it helps. I've never really told anyone the full story before. I always felt so ashamed, like I should have done something differently. But describing it now, I realize how scared and powerless I felt in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're very brave.",
    "Client: I think what hurts the most is the betrayal. This person who promised to love and protect me turned into someone I didn't recognize. The violence, the anger... it was so out of character. Or maybe I just never saw that side of him before. Either way, it shattered my trust not just in him, but in my own judgment.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess. Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. It still hurts, and I'm still angry and sad, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. Talking about it, really facing those memories head-on, it's like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Well done.",
    "Client: I think I understand now why you wanted me to go through this exercise. It's painful, but it's also empowering in a way. I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories, but facing them... it's like they lose some of their power over me. I'm not that helpless person anymore. I've grown, I've healed, even if I still have a way to go.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. But here I am, and while it's difficult, I'm okay. I'm surviving. And maybe that's the most important thing I've learned today - that I'm stronger than I gave myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My body feels tense, especially my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists. But as I focus on it, I can feel some of that tension starting to release. My breathing is a bit steadier now. I feel exhausted, like I've run a marathon, but there's also this strange sense of calm settling over me.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You did well.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a step forward in my healing process. It's like I've reclaimed a part of myself that I thought was lost. I know there's still work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I feel hopeful about the future.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Let's end here."
