    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the dog attack again, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 right now. My palms are a bit sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm walking down the path near my house. It's a sunny afternoon, and I can hear the birds chirping. The grass is really green, and there are wildflowers blooming along the edges of the path. I'm feeling relaxed, just enjoying my usual afternoon walk.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear barking in the distance. At first, I don't think much of it. Lots of people walk their dogs here. But then... (voice trembles) the barking gets louder, and I hear this... this growling. I turn around and... oh God...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Margaret. Remember, you're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: There's this massive dog, some kind of mix breed. It's... it's running straight at me, teeth bared. I... I freeze. I can't move. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) The dog... it leaps at me. I try to turn away, but I'm not fast enough. Its teeth... they sink into my arm. The pain is... it's excruciating. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. I can smell its hot breath, feel its weight on me as we both fall to the ground.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Margaret. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I'm on the ground now. The dog is still... still biting. I'm trying to push it off, but it's so strong. I can feel warm blood running down my arm. I'm... I'm terrified. I think I'm going to die right here on this path.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my heart is racing. My hands are shaking. I feel... I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still on the ground. The dog is still... attacking. But then I hear shouting. Someone... someone's running towards us. It's a man, he's yelling at the dog. He's got a stick or something.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man... he hits the dog with the stick. Not hard, just enough to startle it. The dog lets go of my arm and backs off, still growling. The man stands between me and the dog, waving the stick. I... I can't move. I'm just lying there, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7 or 8. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog's owner finally shows up. He's apologizing, trying to grab the dog's collar. The man who saved me is yelling at him. I... I'm still on the ground. My arm is throbbing. There's so much blood. I feel... I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the grass. It's mixed with the metallic scent of blood. My clothes are torn and dirty. I'm shaking uncontrollably. The man who saved me, he's kneeling beside me now, asking if I'm okay. But I can't... I can't speak. I just keep staring at my arm.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Margaret. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling overwhelmed. My chest feels tight. But... but I'm also here, in your office. I know I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath. What happens next in the memory?",
    "Client: Someone... someone's called an ambulance. I can hear the sirens in the distance. The dog owner is still there, he looks pale and shocked. The man who saved me, he's taken off his jacket and is pressing it against my arm to stop the bleeding. It hurts... it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking this can't be real. This doesn't happen on afternoon walks. I'm... I'm angry at the dog owner. Why wasn't the dog on a leash? I'm... I'm scared about how bad the injury might be. Will I lose function in my arm?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid thoughts. What happens as the ambulance arrives?",
    "Client: The paramedics... they're so calm. They're talking to me, asking questions, but I can barely focus. They're examining my arm, and it hurts when they touch it. They're saying something about stitches and possible nerve damage. I... I start crying again. I'm scared and in pain and... and I just want to go home.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Margaret. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6? I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's continue. What happens as they take you to the hospital?",
    "Client: They... they help me onto a stretcher. The motion makes my arm hurt more. I'm in the ambulance now, and they're putting an IV in my other arm. The paramedic is asking me questions - my name, my age, if I'm allergic to anything. I answer, but I feel like I'm on autopilot.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you noticing about your surroundings?",
    "Client: The inside of the ambulance is so bright. There are machines beeping. I can smell disinfectant. The paramedic's voice is kind, but I'm having trouble focusing on what he's saying. I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit numb. Maybe it's shock, or maybe it's the pain medication they've given me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How does the ride to the hospital feel?",
    "Client: It feels... surreal. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. The pain in my arm is still there, but it feels distant somehow. I'm... I'm thinking about my husband. He doesn't know what's happened. I start to panic a little, wondering how I'll reach him.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe, Margaret. You're safe now. What happens when you arrive at the hospital?",
    "Client: There's... there's a flurry of activity. They wheel me into the emergency room. Bright lights, lots of voices. A doctor comes to examine my arm. He's talking about X-rays and potential surgery. I... I start to cry again. It's all too much.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. How are you feeling right now, remembering this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a mix of things. Scared, remembering how serious it was. Grateful that it wasn't worse. Angry that it happened at all. My arm... my real arm is starting to ache, just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's very common. Your body is remembering too. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 5 now. I'm feeling drained, but also... also a bit proud that I made it through talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've done excellent work today, Margaret. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it's helping. I feel... I feel a bit lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember, you're making progress. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I... I know it's a process. But I'm starting to believe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
