    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my childhood home. It's dark, and I can hear my parents arguing downstairs. I'm in my room, trying to block out the noise. The yelling is getting louder, and I'm feeling scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I can hear footsteps coming up the stairs. My heart is racing, and I'm hiding under my blanket. The door opens, and I can see my father's silhouette. He's angry, and I'm terrified he'll hurt me like he did last time.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's yelling at me now, saying it's my fault they're fighting. I'm shaking, and I can feel tears running down my face. I want to disappear. The smell of alcohol on his breath makes me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: He grabs my arm, pulling me out of bed. It hurts, and I'm crying harder now. I can see my mother in the doorway, looking helpless. I'm begging her to help me, but she just stands there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I don't know if I can keep going. This is too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. We can pause if needed.",
    "Client: No, I... I want to continue. He's dragging me downstairs now. I'm stumbling, trying to keep up. The living room is a mess - there are broken glasses on the floor. He pushes me onto the couch and starts screaming in my face.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm curled up, trying to make myself as small as possible. He's telling me I'm worthless, that I ruined their lives. I believe him. I feel so small and helpless. I just want it to stop.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're stronger than you think.",
    "Client: I can hear my mother crying in the background. She's pleading with him to stop, but he ignores her. He raises his hand, and I flinch, expecting a blow. But then... then the doorbell rings.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... relief. Confusion. Fear. The doorbell seems to snap my father out of his rage. He looks scared for a moment, then tells me to go to my room. I run upstairs, my heart pounding. I can hear him talking to someone at the door - it sounds like our neighbor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm in my room, listening. The voices downstairs are muffled, but I can tell my father is trying to act normal. I'm shaking, hugging my knees to my chest. I'm afraid of what will happen when the neighbor leaves.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: After what feels like forever, I hear the front door close. There's silence for a moment, then I hear my parents talking in hushed voices. No more yelling. I'm still scared, but also... relieved? The worst seems to be over.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Sad. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I survived reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. Can we end here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made significant progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we conclude."
