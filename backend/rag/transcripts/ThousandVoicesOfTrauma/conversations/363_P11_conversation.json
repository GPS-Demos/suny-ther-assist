    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of being trapped in the hospital room during the medical emergency... it's like I was right back there. I could almost smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the machines. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness. I felt so powerless, like I couldn't do anything to help myself or control what was happening. It's frustrating because I'm usually the one in charge, you know? In my professional life, I make decisions all the time, but in that moment... I was just at the mercy of others.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding medical check-ups. Even routine ones. I'm scared of feeling that helpless again. It's affecting my health, and I know it's not rational, but I can't seem to shake it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm more irritable at home. My husband doesn't understand why I get so anxious about small health issues. I feel guilty for pushing him away, but I don't know how to explain it to him.",
    "Therapist: How might you start that conversation?",
    "Client: Maybe... I could tell him about these sessions? Explain that I'm working through some trauma? It's hard because I don't want to burden him, but I know he wants to help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good step. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: I've been having trouble sleeping. I keep replaying that scene in my head, especially at night. It's like my brain won't shut off. And during the day, I'm exhausted, which makes everything harder. My work is suffering, and I'm worried about losing my edge professionally.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have helped so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been helpful. When I feel panic rising, I try to focus on my breath. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it helps ground me. And... talking about it here, as hard as it is, makes me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing how much this experience has affected different areas of my life. It's not just about avoiding hospitals. It's impacting my relationships, my work, my sleep. But I also feel a tiny bit more in control now that I can name what's happening.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I don't want to be controlled by this fear anymore. It's exhausting, but I'm committed to working through it.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. What's one small goal for this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try talking to my husband about what I'm going through. Just a little bit, to start. And maybe... schedule a check-up with my doctor. I don't have to go yet, but just making the appointment might be a good first step.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent goals. Anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: I'm just... grateful, I guess. For this space to work through things. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. Thank you for your patience with me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How would you like to close today?",
