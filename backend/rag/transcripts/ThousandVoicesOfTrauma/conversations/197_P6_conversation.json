    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting at my computer. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. The room is dark except for the glow of the screen. I've just opened my social media account, and... oh god, there are so many notifications. My heart is starting to race.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 4. I can feel the anxiety building.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue describing what you see.",
    "Client: I click on the notifications, and it's just a flood of hateful comments. People I don't even know are calling me horrible names, threatening me. Someone's posted private information about me. I feel so exposed, so violated. My hands are shaking now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I can't seem to catch my breath. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I might be sick. It's like I'm right back there, helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" I feel so ashamed, even though I know I shouldn't. I want to disappear, to make it all stop. I'm scrolling through the comments, each one like a knife. I can't look away.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to respond, to defend myself. But it just makes things worse. More people join in. I feel overwhelmed, outnumbered. My fingers are trembling as I type. I'm crying now, tears blurring my vision.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. Keep describing.",
    "Client: I shut down my computer, but I can still hear the notifications on my phone. Ding after ding. It's relentless. I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. I feel so small, so vulnerable. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear, anger, humiliation. I feel betrayed by people I thought were friends. I'm furious at the strangers who joined in. But mostly, I just feel... broken. Like I'll never be the same again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. What do you notice now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a little calmer. My breathing is slowing down. I'm reminding myself that I survived this. That I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: The tightness in my chest is easing. My hands have stopped shaking. I feel... drained, but also a little lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I didn't expect it to decrease like this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're showing great resilience. How do you feel about the experience now?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but... I feel like I have more control. Like I can face it without being overwhelmed. It doesn't have the same power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Thank you. This was intense, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 2. I feel tired, but also... relieved, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll process this more next time. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself."
