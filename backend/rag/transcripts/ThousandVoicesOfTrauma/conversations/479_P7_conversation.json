    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat scene you mentioned last time?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. We were on patrol in a small village. It was hot, dusty. The air smelled like spices and diesel. I remember feeling tense, my rifle heavy in my hands. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I saw... I saw my friend John get hit. There was so much blood...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: It's hard... I can hear the screaming now. People were running everywhere. I froze for a second, then training kicked in. I ran to John, tried to apply pressure to his wounds. His eyes were wide, scared. I kept telling him he'd be okay, but I knew... I knew he wouldn't make it.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It was. I feel my heart racing just thinking about it. The gunfire was constant. I dragged John behind a wall, but he was so heavy. I remember the warm stickiness of his blood on my hands. I couldn't save him. I couldn't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I feel like I failed him. I keep seeing his face, hearing his last words. He asked me to tell his wife he loved her. Then he just... went limp. I felt so helpless, so angry. The fighting continued around us, but in that moment, everything seemed to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: After John died, I rejoined the fight. I was operating on autopilot, my training taking over. I remember the acrid smell of gunpowder, the heat from my rifle. I took down two enemy combatants. I'd never killed anyone before that day. It felt... surreal. Like I was watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're safe here.",
    "Client: When it was over, the silence was deafening. The village was in ruins. There were bodies everywhere - civilians, enemies, our own people. The smell of death was overwhelming. I helped gather our casualties, John among them. I couldn't look at his face as we loaded him onto the transport. I felt numb, disconnected. That night, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw John's face, heard the explosions. It's been years, but sometimes it feels like I never left that village.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... shaky. My heart's still racing. But... I feel a little lighter, I think. Like I've shared some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe a little less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's always been locked away, you know? But being able to describe it, to put it into words... it's hard, but it feels important somehow. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How about we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling pretty drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign.",
    "Client: Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I think I might sleep better tonight, knowing I've faced this memory head-on. Is it okay if we continue with this next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support and patience. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Thank you for creating a safe space for me to confront these memories.",
    "Therapist: You've done the hard work. Take care until next time."
