    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the animal attack you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a sunny day at the park. I was there with my younger cousin. We were walking near the playground when suddenly we heard screaming. I turned and saw a large dog attacking a small child. It was... it was terrible. The child was on the ground, and the dog was biting their arm. There was blood, and the child's screams were so loud.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I froze for a moment. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. People were running towards the scene, but it felt like everything was moving in slow motion. The child's mother was hysterical, trying to pull the dog off. I remember feeling my heart racing, and my hands were shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I wanted to help, but I was terrified. What if the dog turned on me? I felt so ashamed for not rushing in. Instead, I grabbed my cousin and pulled her away. We ran to a nearby tree, and I held her tightly. She was crying, and I was trying to calm her down, but I could barely breathe myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Continue.",
    "Client: The attack seemed to last forever, but it was probably only a minute or two. Finally, a man managed to pull the dog away. The child was lying there, covered in blood, still screaming. I remember the sound of sirens approaching. I felt sick to my stomach, and my legs were weak.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: Emergency services arrived quickly. They tended to the child while animal control dealt with the dog. I couldn't take my eyes off the scene. The child's cries had turned into whimpers, and I felt this overwhelming sense of relief that they were alive. But I also felt guilty for not helping, for just standing there watching.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: After things calmed down, I took my cousin home. I tried to act normal, but I couldn't shake the images from my mind. That night, I had terrible nightmares. I kept seeing the dog attacking, but sometimes it was attacking me or my cousin instead. For weeks after, I avoided parks and was terrified of dogs. Even now, years later, I still feel anxious around large dogs.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. My heart is racing, and I feel tense all over. I can still hear the screams in my head. But talking about it... it's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. It's like I'm starting to see it from a distance, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That's a good observation. Continue.",
    "Client: I think what bothers me most now is the guilt. I wish I had done something to help. I know logically that I was just trying to protect my cousin, but part of me still feels like a coward. And I hate that this incident has made me so fearful of dogs. I used to love them, but now I can't help but see them as potential threats.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... I've never really talked about this in detail before. It's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to suppress. But at the same time, there's a small sense of relief in finally sharing this. Like maybe I can start to process it properly now.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. My heart rate is starting to slow down, and the tension in my muscles is easing a bit. It's strange, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier now. Is this normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never realized how much this incident was still affecting me until now. I think I've been carrying this weight around for so long, it became normal. But talking about it, facing those memories head-on... it's challenging, but I can see how it might help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. Let's continue.",
    "Client: Okay. I think what I want to work on most is letting go of the guilt. I know rationally that I couldn't have done much to help, but emotionally, I still struggle with it. And I'd like to be able to enjoy parks again, to not feel that rush of anxiety every time I see a large dog. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to hear. I feel hopeful for the first time in a while. This session has been intense, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. Thank you for guiding me through this.",

I'm nervous about our next session, but also looking forward to it. Thank you again for your support and guidance.",
