    "Therapist: Hello, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having trouble sleeping lately, thinking about this session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of revisiting that moment when I lost my wife. It's been three years, but it still feels so raw. And with all this cyberbullying stuff going on at work, I feel like I'm barely keeping it together. I'm not sure I can handle reliving that trauma.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Shall we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. I mean, I trust you, but this feels... scary.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the memory safely. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I think so. Go ahead.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. I'll guide you throughout. Thoughts?",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. Will it make things worse? I'm already struggling with my depression and this cyberbullying situation at work. I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging, but it's designed to help. How does that sit with you?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but I appreciate your honesty. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? And how long will it take?",
    "Therapist: We'll spend about 30-45 minutes on the exercise. You'll describe the memory in detail. Questions?",
    "Client: That's a long time to focus on such a painful memory. Will you be there the whole time? And what if I can't handle it and need to stop?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime you need. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess knowing I have some control helps. But what if I get overwhelmed or have a panic attack? It's happened before when I think about losing her.",
    "Therapist: We'll practice coping techniques beforehand. Shall we try some now?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I'm realizing how tense I am just talking about this. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Let's try a quick breathing exercise. Follow my lead. Ready?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready. This reminds me of the mindfulness exercises my wife and I used to do together. It's bittersweet, but... I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How do you feel after the breathing exercise?",
    "Client: A bit better, actually. My shoulders have relaxed a little. I can see how this might help during the actual exercise. But I'm still worried about how I'll feel afterward. Will I be able to function? I have a big project at work I need to focus on.",
    "Therapist: We'll debrief thoroughly after. How about scheduling a follow-up call tomorrow?",
    "Client: That would be really helpful, thank you. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It makes me feel like I'm not alone in this. I guess... I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you tell me one more time why this is important?",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory, reducing its power over you. Brave of you to try.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I know my wife would want me to heal and move forward. I just hope this helps with the nightmares and flashbacks. And maybe if I can handle this, I can better deal with the work situation too.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin the exercise?",
    "Client: Okay. Yes, let's do this. I'm scared, but I'm also hopeful. For the first time in a while, I feel like maybe things can get better. I'm ready."
