    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the animal attack again, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 right now. Just thinking about it is making me feel a bit queasy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe that day.",
    "Client: *Takes a deep breath* Alright... I'm at the park near my apartment. It's a sunny afternoon, and I can hear kids playing in the distance. I'm sitting on a bench, reading a book. The grass is so green, and there's a light breeze...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear a commotion. There's shouting, and then I see it. This big, angry dog. It's running towards a group of children. Oh god, its teeth are bared, and it's growling... I... I can't move. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 7? My hands are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take another deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *Inhales shakily* The dog... it's getting closer to the kids. I want to yell, to warn them, but my voice won't work. I'm just sitting there, useless. And then... oh god, it happens so fast. The dog lunges at one of the little girls. She's screaming, and there's blood, so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I'm yelling for help, but it feels like nobody's coming. The girl is on the ground, and the dog is still... it's still attacking her. I can hear her crying, begging for her mom. I... I finally get up. My legs feel like jelly, but I'm running towards them.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel sick to my stomach. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. You're safe.",
    "Client: As I get closer, I can smell the blood. It's... it's overwhelming. I grab a stick from the ground, and I'm swinging it at the dog, trying to get it away from the girl. I'm terrified it's going to turn on me, but I can't just stand there anymore. The dog finally backs off, and I'm standing between it and the girl. She's sobbing behind me, and I can hear people running towards us now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 or 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *Takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. The dog's owner finally arrives, out of breath. He's apologizing, trying to control the dog. Paramedics are there too, tending to the girl. I'm still standing there, shaking. I can't seem to let go of the stick. Someone's asking me if I'm okay, but I can't answer. I just keep staring at the blood on the grass.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Why didn't I react sooner? Why couldn't I move?",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. Remember, you did act. Continue.",
    "Client: Right... um, the girl's mom arrives. She's hysterical, crying. I try to explain what happened, but my words are all jumbled. I keep seeing the attack replay in my mind. The sound of the girl's screams, the growling of the dog... it's like it's on a loop in my head.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I notice I'm covered in the girl's blood. It's on my hands, my clothes. I start to feel dizzy. Someone helps me sit down on the bench. I can hear sirens in the distance. People are gathering around, asking questions. I just want to disappear. I feel so... exposed. Like everyone's looking at me, judging me for not doing more.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *Breathes slowly* Okay... The police arrive. They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. I keep looking over at the girl. She's on a stretcher now, being loaded into an ambulance. Her mom is going with her. I feel so guilty... like I should have done more, reacted faster.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. What happens next?",
    "Client: One of the officers suggests I get checked out too. I didn't realize it, but I've got some scratches on my arms from the stick I was holding. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else. I agree to go to the hospital, mostly because I don't know what else to do. As I'm walking to the ambulance, I look back at the park. It looks so normal, like nothing happened. But that patch of grass... it's stained dark red. I don't think I'll ever be able to come back here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My SUDS is maybe a 6 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I did eventually do something, even if it wasn't as quick as I wanted.",
    "Therapist: That's a very important realization. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* I can feel the chair beneath me. I can see the painting on your wall. I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, let's talk about what you experienced during this exercise.",
    "Client: It was... intense. More vivid than I expected. I could almost smell the grass, hear the screams. But... I also noticed things I hadn't before. Like how I did eventually act, even though I was terrified. And how the park looked afterwards... so normal, but forever changed for me.",
    "Therapist: Those are very insightful observations. How do you feel about your response now?",
    "Client: I... I still wish I had acted sooner. But I realize now that I did the best I could in a terrifying situation. I didn't run away. I stayed and tried to help. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You showed tremendous courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed to hear that. This whole experience, reliving it like this... it's hard, but I think it's helping me process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You did very well today. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 or 4. I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end our session here and discuss how you can continue processing these feelings at home.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I actually feel good about today's session. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, healing is a process. We'll continue working through this together."
