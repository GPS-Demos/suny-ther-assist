    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe your experience with the cult?",
    "Client: Okay... I was 65 when I first got involved. My husband had just passed away, and I was feeling lost. A friend introduced me to this group that promised spiritual enlightenment and community. At first, it seemed wonderful. We'd meet in this old church building, and the leader, James, would give these captivating speeches about finding inner peace and purpose.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As time went on, things started to change. James began demanding more of our time and money. He'd say it was for the \"greater good\" of our community. I remember one particular meeting where he announced that we all needed to sell our homes and move to a compound he'd purchased. I felt a knot in my stomach, but everyone around me was nodding and agreeing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I didn't want to leave my home. It was where I'd lived with my husband for 40 years. But James said those who didn't commit fully were holding back the group's spiritual progress. I felt so conflicted and scared. I didn't want to lose the only community I had left, but something felt very wrong.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: One night, I overheard James talking to his inner circle. They were discussing how to \"handle\" those who were hesitant about moving. I heard my name mentioned. James said I had a sizable retirement fund that could greatly benefit the group. That's when I realized it was all about money and control. I felt sick to my stomach, like I'd been betrayed all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you feel physically?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt dizzy. I remember my hands were shaking as I drove home that night. I kept looking in my rearview mirror, afraid someone from the group might be following me. When I got home, I broke down crying. I felt so foolish for falling for their lies, for almost giving up everything I had.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: The next day, I didn't answer any calls from the group. I was terrified they'd come to my house. I felt like a prisoner in my own home. After a few days, I finally called my daughter and told her everything. She was shocked and angry, but also relieved I hadn't gone through with selling my house. She helped me contact a support group for cult survivors.",
    "Therapist: You showed great strength. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's still painful to think about how close I came to losing everything. I feel angry at James and the others who took advantage of vulnerable people like me. But I also feel proud that I recognized the danger and got out. It's just... sometimes I still have nightmares about being trapped in that compound, unable to escape.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You've come a long way.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's hard. I worry sometimes that I could be manipulated again. But I'm learning to trust my instincts more. The support group has been really helpful in understanding what happened and why I was vulnerable. I just wish I could forget the whole experience sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're doing well.",
    "Client: You're right, it is a process. Some days are better than others. I'm grateful for my daughter and the new friends I've made in my support group. They've helped me see that it wasn't my fault, that these groups are designed to prey on people when they're vulnerable. I'm trying to focus on the future now, on rebuilding my life and my sense of self.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess. Talking about it is still difficult, but it doesn't have the same power over me that it used to. I'm learning to forgive myself for being pulled in by their promises. And I'm starting to see how I can use my experience to help others who might be in similar situations. It's given me a new purpose, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've made some real progress today. Thank you for guiding me through it and for your support. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care."
