    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that memory of being imprisoned... it brought back so many feelings I've tried to push down for years. The helplessness, the fear, the anger... it's all just bubbling up now.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The darkness. I remember how pitch black it was in that cell. And the silence... it was deafening. I could hear my own heartbeat, my own breathing. It was like the world had disappeared, and I was left alone with my thoughts. That's what scared me the most, I think. Being alone with my mind in that darkness.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that affect you physically?",
    "Client: My hands are still shaking a bit. I felt my heart racing during the exposure, just like it did back then. And there's this tightness in my chest that won't go away. It's like... like I'm still trapped there, you know? Even though I know I'm here, safe in your office, a part of me is still in that cell.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we talked about. Focusing on my breath, reminding myself where I am. It helps a little, but... it's hard. I keep thinking about how this experience has shaped my life, my relationships. I've always struggled with trust since then, always feeling like the rug could be pulled out from under me at any moment.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How does this connect to your anxiety?",
    "Client: Oh, it's definitely related. I think that constant state of alertness I developed in prison... it never really went away. I'm always on edge, always expecting the worst. It's exhausting, really. And it affects everything - my work, my marriage, even how I parent my kids. I don't want them to grow up with a mom who's always afraid.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I think I realized how much that experience still affects me. But also... maybe there's hope? Going through it again was terrifying, but I did it. And I'm still here. Maybe that means I'm stronger than I thought. Maybe I can face this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I think... I think I need to do this. For myself, for my family. I want to be free from this, truly free. Not just out of that cell, but out of the prison I've built in my mind. It won't be easy, but... I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try talking to my husband about this. I've always kept it bottled up, but maybe sharing it will help. And I want to keep working on these exposures. It's hard, but I can see how it might help in the long run. I just... I need to remember that I'm safe now, that it's over. That's the hardest part.",
    "Therapist: That's a great plan. How can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... keep doing what you're doing, I guess. Having this safe space to process everything means a lot. And maybe we could work more on those grounding techniques? I think I'll need them as we go deeper into this. Oh, and... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know it's your job, but... it means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue at your pace. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. I'm exhausted, to be honest. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? It's a strange mix of feelings. I'm dreading our next session a bit, but I'm also looking forward to it in a way. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a normal part of the process.",
    "Client: Okay, good. I just... I want to get better. For myself, for my family. I want to be able to enjoy life without this constant fear and anxiety. It's not going to be easy, but I'm starting to believe it might be possible. And that's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your commitment is commendable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again. I... I think I'm ready to face this head-on now. It's terrifying, but also... liberating in a way. I'm ready to reclaim my life from this trauma. One step at a time, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Take care, and remember to use your coping strategies.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you. See you next week."
