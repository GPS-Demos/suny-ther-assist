    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Johnson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about what I saw, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face it all again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel apprehensive. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it actually involves. Is it... is it going to be really intense?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your recovery. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your trauma memory in a safe environment. It helps process the event and reduce its emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: That sounds... scary, to be honest. I've been trying so hard not to think about it. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a common concern. However, avoidance often prolongs symptoms. This helps you confront and process the memory.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? Or if it becomes too much to handle?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control. We can pause or stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate that you're giving me control over the situation. It's just... the idea of voluntarily reliving that day... it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is completely normal. Remember, you're safe here. What other concerns do you have?",
    "Client: I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally? I have a big presentation at work tomorrow, and I can't afford to be a mess.",
    "Therapist: We'll end with grounding exercises. Many find they feel relieved after. Shall we discuss coping strategies for after the session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be really helpful. I'm also curious... how long will this process take? Is it something we'll do in every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for several sessions, typically once a week. The length varies for each person. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: That makes sense. I guess I'm just trying to prepare myself mentally. Dr. Johnson, can I ask... have you seen this work for other people who've witnessed violence like I have?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I've seen significant improvements in many clients with similar experiences. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That's encouraging to hear. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll be doing today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with relaxation exercises, then you'll recount the memory. I'll guide you through it. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think so. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great already. Your willingness to engage is a big step. Shall we start with some deep breathing?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I could use some calming down right now. Thank you for being so understanding and supportive, Dr. Johnson. It really helps."
