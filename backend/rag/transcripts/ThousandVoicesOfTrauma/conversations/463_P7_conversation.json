    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a massive earthquake. I was just 10 years old. We were visiting family in Pakistan when it hit. I remember waking up to the whole room shaking violently. The walls were cracking, and pieces of the ceiling were falling down. I was so scared, I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: My parents were yelling, trying to get us out. But I was frozen in fear. The ground kept shaking, and I could hear screams from outside. It felt like the world was ending. I remember the deafening sound of buildings collapsing nearby.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can still feel the terror. My father grabbed me and carried me out. The streets were chaos. People were running, crying. There was dust everywhere, making it hard to breathe. I saw a building collapse right in front of us, and I thought we were going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) We ran to an open area. The aftershocks kept coming. I was shivering, not from cold, but from fear. I saw injured people, blood... it was overwhelming. The worst part was the uncertainty. We didn't know if another big quake would hit, if our relatives were okay, or if we'd ever get back home.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) For days, we lived in makeshift tents. The fear never left. Every small tremor sent panic through the camp. I couldn't sleep. I kept imagining being trapped under rubble. The smell of dust and death lingered everywhere. It's... it's hard to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're showing great courage. Take your time.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) The relief efforts were slow. We had limited food and water. I remember feeling so helpless, so small in the face of nature's power. Even when we finally got back home, the fear stayed with me. For years, I'd wake up in cold sweats, thinking the ground was shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your experience.",
    "Client: It's strange, but talking about it now, I can feel my heart racing just like it did back then. The images are so vivid - the cracks in the walls, the dust in the air, the cries of people around us. It's like I'm there again, but... I know I'm here, safe in your office.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter? It's intense to revisit those memories, but there's something... I don't know, maybe cathartic about speaking them out loud. I've kept this bottled up for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I think I understand now why we're doing this. It's like... facing the memory head-on instead of running from it. I just hope it gets easier with time.",
    "Therapist: It often does. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength today. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that's a good idea. I feel emotionally drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud of myself? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a significant achievement. We'll pick this up next time."
