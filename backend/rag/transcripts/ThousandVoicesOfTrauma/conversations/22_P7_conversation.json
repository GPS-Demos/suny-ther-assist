    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. So, I'm back at the compound. It's early morning, and I can hear the leader's voice over the loudspeaker. He's saying... he's saying that we need to prepare for the \"ascension.\" My heart is starting to race.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The voice is getting louder. Everyone around me is rushing, packing bags. I feel confused and scared. My partner is next to me, squeezing my hand so tight it hurts. I want to ask questions, but I'm afraid to speak up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. The air feels thick. People are crying, some are praying. I don't understand what's happening. Why can't I think clearly? It's like my mind is foggy.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The leader appears. He's wearing all white, and he has this... this look in his eyes. It's almost manic. He's telling us that today is the day we've all been waiting for. That we'll finally be free. But I don't feel free. I feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He starts handing out cups. The liquid inside is dark. My hands are shaking as I take one. I don't want to drink it, but everyone else is. My partner is urging me to do it. I feel so torn, so scared. I can't... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I put the cup to my lips. The smell is sickening. I'm crying now, silently. I want to run, but where would I go? They told us the outside world was evil, that we'd die if we left. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a commotion. Someone's screaming. It's chaos. People are collapsing. I drop my cup, and the liquid spills on the ground. My partner is angry, saying I've ruined everything. But I can't focus on that because others are... they're not moving. Oh god, they're not moving!",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: I'm frozen. I can't move. The leader is shouting something about betrayal, about how we've failed the mission. But all I can see are the bodies. My friends, people I've known for years. They're just... gone. And I'm still here. Why am I still here?",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: I... I think I need to stop. This is... it's too much. I feel like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly okay. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think it would still feel so real after all this time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Can we... can we talk about some coping strategies now? I feel really shaken up.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's focus on grounding techniques."
