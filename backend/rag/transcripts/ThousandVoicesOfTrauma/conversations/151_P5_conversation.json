    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, Dr. Chen. Although, I must admit, I'm feeling quite apprehensive about it. Could you explain more about what this entails?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. What concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent years trying to forget about the emotional abuse I endured during my divorce. The idea of deliberately bringing those memories to the surface... it's rather daunting. I'm worried it might set back the progress I've made in my life since then.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. How do you think revisiting might affect you?",
    "Client: I fear it might reopen old wounds. I've worked hard to rebuild my life, my career, and my relationship with my children after the divorce. What if this exercise brings back all the pain and anger I've tried to move past?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How have you coped with memories in the past?",
    "Client: I've mostly tried to keep busy with work and family. But sometimes, especially at night, the memories creep in. I feel a deep sense of shame and inadequacy. It's as if I'm reliving those moments when my ex-wife would belittle me, criticize my every move. I've never really talked about it in detail before.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How do you feel about exploring these memories now?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but also... hopeful? If this can help me process what happened and truly move forward, I'm willing to try. But I'm worried about becoming overwhelmed. How will you help me through this?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you throughout, ensuring you feel safe. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your support, Dr. Chen. I suppose I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You might experience strong emotions. That's normal and part of healing.",
    "Client: I see. It's a bit intimidating, but I understand the purpose. I've always prided myself on being strong and composed, especially in my professional life. The idea of becoming emotional during our session is uncomfortable. But I trust your expertise, and I'm committed to this process.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Thank you for your patience and guidance, Dr. Chen. I know this won't be easy, but I'm hopeful it will help me finally address these lingering issues from my past. Let's proceed with the imaginal exposure."
