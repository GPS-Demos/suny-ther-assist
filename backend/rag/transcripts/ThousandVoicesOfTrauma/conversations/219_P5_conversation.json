    "Therapist: Good morning, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm not sure. A bit nervous, I guess. I know we talked about doing something different today, and that's got me on edge.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we planned.",
    "Client: Right, that. I've been thinking about it since our last session. To be honest, I'm scared. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget what happened during that time when I was trafficked as a child. The thought of bringing it all back up makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is valid. This exercise can be challenging.",
    "Client: Challenging feels like an understatement, doc. It's like you're asking me to walk into my worst nightmare voluntarily. I mean, I trust you, but... how is this supposed to help? Won't it just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: It may feel worse initially, but it's crucial for healing.",
    "Client: I hear you, but... God, just thinking about it makes me feel like I can't breathe. Those men, the things they did... I've never told anyone the full story. How am I supposed to just... say it out loud?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control here.",
    "Client: Control? That's... that's ironic, isn't it? I had no control then, and now you're telling me I have it. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be difficult. I know you're trying to help. It's just... this is bringing up so much. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Together... okay. I appreciate that. Can you... can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Recount it? All of it? I... I don't know if I can do that. There are parts I've never spoken about, things I've tried so hard to forget. What if I panic? What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: We have coping strategies ready. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Safe... it's been so long since I felt truly safe. Okay, I'll try. But can we... can we have a signal or something? In case it gets too much and I need to stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's establish a signal now.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps. Maybe... maybe I could raise my hand if I need a break? And... how long will this take? Will we do it all in one session?",
    "Therapist: Hand signal works. We'll take breaks as needed.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm still scared, but I'm trying to be brave. You really think this will help with my nightmares and anxiety? It's hard to imagine feeling better after reliving the worst moments of my life.",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective for many. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: I don't feel very courageous right now. But I want to get better. I'm tired of living in fear, of the nightmares, of feeling like I'm still that helpless child. If this can help... I'll do it. Just... please be patient with me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll take it step by step. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. As ready as I'll ever be. Can you... can you just remind me one more time why we're doing this? I need to hear it to steel myself.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma, reducing its power over you.",
    "Client: Reducing its power... I like the sound of that. Okay. Okay, let's do this. I'm scared, but I'm here. Where do we start?"
