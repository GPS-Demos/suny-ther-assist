    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest sensation you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: The tension in my shoulders. It's like I'm still bracing for impact. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I can still hear the explosions echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do more?\" I see their faces, the young soldiers under my command. I should have protected them better. It's my fault they... (voice breaks) I'm sorry, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's just... I've spent so long trying to push these memories away. Now that I'm facing them, it's overwhelming. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. And there's this anger, too. At the situation, at the enemy, at myself.",
    "Therapist: How does allowing yourself to experience these emotions feel different from pushing them away?",
    "Client: It's... strangely freeing, in a way. Terrifying, but also like I'm finally acknowledging a part of myself I've ignored for so long. It's exhausting, though. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that feeling of lightness?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, I've been carrying this heavy backpack full of these memories and emotions. And now, by talking about it, by reliving it in a safe space, it's like I'm unpacking that backpack bit by bit. It doesn't make the contents any less painful, but the load feels a little more manageable.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to your broader journey of recovery?",
    "Client: I guess it's showing me that I can face these memories without completely falling apart. For so long, I've been afraid that if I let myself remember, I'd just... shatter. But here I am, shaken but still whole. It gives me a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I can work through this.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider that possibility?",
    "Client: A mix of things, really. There's fear, definitely. Fear that it'll get worse before it gets better. But there's also a tiny spark of... I don't know, determination maybe? Like, now that I've started this, I want to see it through. I'm tired of letting these memories control my life.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express that determination?",
    "Client: Huh, that's interesting. My shoulders have relaxed a bit, actually. And I notice I'm sitting up straighter. It's like my body is echoing that little spark of hope, saying \"Yeah, we can do this.\"",
    "Therapist: What do you think has allowed you to access that feeling of hope today?",
    "Client: I think... well, part of it is just finally giving myself permission to remember. For so long, I've tried to be strong for everyone else - my family, my colleagues. But here, in this room, I can just be me. The scared, guilty, angry me. And somehow, facing all that head-on makes me feel stronger than pretending it doesn't exist.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this experience forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be more honest with myself in my day-to-day life. Not constantly reliving the trauma, but not pushing it away entirely either. Finding a balance where I can acknowledge it without letting it overwhelm me. And maybe... maybe talking to my husband about it more. He's always said he's there to listen, but I've never really opened up.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant step. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... ready, I think. It's time. I'm tired of carrying this alone, and I know it affects him too, even when I try to hide it. It won't be easy, but after today, I feel like it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean for you to share this burden with your husband?",
    "Client: It would mean... letting go of some control, I suppose. Admitting that I'm not as 'fine' as I've been pretending to be. But it could also mean feeling less alone in this. Maybe even strengthening our relationship. He's been so patient with me all these years, even when he didn't understand what was going on.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of strengthening your relationship through this process sit with you?",
    "Client: It's both scary and exciting. Scary because it means being vulnerable, which isn't easy for me. But exciting because... well, I love him. And the thought of him truly understanding what I've been going through, of not having to hide anymore... it's powerful. It's like I can see a future where this trauma doesn't stand between us anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that future?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start by telling him about these therapy sessions. Not all the details, but just... that I'm working on processing my experiences. Let him know that I might be more emotional than usual, but that it's part of the healing process. And maybe... maybe ask if he'd be willing to just sit with me sometimes, even if I'm not ready to talk.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. There's a lot to process, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done important work today. Take care of yourself as you continue to process."
