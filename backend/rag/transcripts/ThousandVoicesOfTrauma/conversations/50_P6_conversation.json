    "Therapist: Alright, John. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in our old house. I can smell Mom's cooking, but there's tension in the air. Dad just got home, and he's... he's angry about something. I can hear him shouting from the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The shouting's getting louder. I'm in my room, trying to block it out. But then I hear a crash, and Mom screams. My heart's racing now, and I'm... I'm scared to leave my room.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and my throat's tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I force myself to open the door. As I creep down the hallway, I can see into the kitchen. Dad's got Mom by the arm, shaking her. There's a broken plate on the floor. I want to help her, but I'm frozen...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. God, I feel so helpless. My chest is so tight, it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Mom sees me and her eyes go wide. She's trying to tell me to go back to my room without speaking. But Dad notices and he... he lets go of her and starts coming towards me. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right there again. My legs are shaking, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: *nods* Dad reaches me and grabs my arm. It hurts, and I can smell the alcohol on his breath. He's yelling at me, telling me to go back to my room, that this isn't my business. I'm crying now, and I can see Mom crying too.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My arm aches where he grabbed me, even though I know it's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to pull away, but his grip tightens. Mom's begging him to let me go, and he finally does, shoving me towards my room. I run back, slamming the door, and I can hear them fighting again. I'm curled up on my bed, hands over my ears, wishing it would all stop.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to a 7. I feel drained, and there's this hollow feeling in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, John. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: *opens eyes, looks around* That was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... maybe a little stronger? My SUDS is down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's talk about what you experienced."
