    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. The idea of revisiting that airplane crash... it's not easy. I've been trying to avoid thinking about it for so long. Plus, with everything else going on in my life - the shared accommodation, the stress at work, and my struggles with substance use - I'm not sure if I can handle this right now.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your hesitations?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving the crash might trigger a panic attack or make me want to use again. I've been doing better with my substance use lately, and I don't want to jeopardize that progress. Also, I'm not sure how this will help me. Won't talking about it just make things worse?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Imaginal exposure can feel daunting, but it's a crucial step in healing. How do you think it might help?",
    "Client: I suppose it could help me face my fears instead of avoiding them. Maybe it'll reduce the nightmares I've been having? But I'm still scared. What if I can't handle it? What if I freeze up or lose control?",
    "Therapist: Those are common concerns. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will this take? Will we do this every session? And what exactly am I supposed to do? Just talk about the crash? I'm not sure I remember all the details clearly.",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for about 30-45 minutes today. You'll describe the event in present tense, including thoughts and feelings. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. But I'm still feeling anxious. My heart's racing just thinking about it. Can we stop if it gets too overwhelming? And what if I start craving substances during or after the session?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely, we can pause anytime. Your safety is paramount. Let's discuss coping strategies for cravings before we start.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. I appreciate your understanding, especially given our different backgrounds. It's not easy for me to open up about this, but I trust you. I just hope this really does help with my PTSD symptoms.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable, Rahul. This process, while challenging, is a significant step towards healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. But please, if you see me struggling too much, don't hesitate to step in. I'm putting a lot of trust in you to guide me through this.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your trust. Remember, you're in control. Let's start whenever you're comfortable."
