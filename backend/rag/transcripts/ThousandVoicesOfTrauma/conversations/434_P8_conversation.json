    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is vibrating from the inside. My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. I can still see his face so clearly in my mind, you know? It's like he's right here in the room with us.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt in that moment. How he just... he just took what he wanted, and I couldn't do anything to stop him. And then I start wondering, was it my fault? Did I somehow invite this? I know, logically, that it wasn't my fault, but there's this nagging voice in my head that won't shut up.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that voice make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So, so angry. Not just at him, but at myself too. I'm angry that I still let this affect me after all these years. I'm angry that I can't just move on and forget about it. And then I feel guilty for being angry because I know I should be focusing on healing, not on being angry. It's like this vicious cycle in my head.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you express that anger?",
    "Client: My jaw is clenched tight. I can feel the tension in my shoulders, like I'm bracing for something. And my stomach... it's in knots. It's like my whole body is coiled, ready to spring. But at the same time, I feel so tired. Exhausted, really. Like I've been running a marathon.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after the incident?",
    "Client: Back then, I felt... numb. Like I was watching everything happen to someone else. I didn't feel angry then, just... empty. Hollow. Like he had taken something from me that I could never get back. And scared. So, so scared. I remember constantly looking over my shoulder, jumping at every little noise. Now, it's different. The fear is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. The anger is new, or at least, I'm only now allowing myself to feel it.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me feels like the anger is a step forward. Like I'm finally standing up for myself, even if it's just in my own mind. But another part of me is scared of the anger. What if I can't control it? What if it consumes me?",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How do you think you might channel that anger?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Maybe... maybe I could use it to help others? To speak out about what happened to me, to raise awareness. Or maybe I could use it to push myself forward in my recovery. To refuse to let what he did define me or limit me. But then I worry... what if I'm not strong enough? What if I try and fail?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you if you did try?",
    "Client: It would mean... it would mean taking back some of the power he took from me. It would mean showing myself that I'm more than what happened to me. That I'm still here, still fighting. But it's scary. The thought of putting myself out there, of being vulnerable... it makes my heart race. But at the same time, there's a part of me that feels... excited? Like maybe this could be the start of something new.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and exhilarating. Like standing on the edge of a cliff, looking down at the water below. Part of me wants to jump, to feel the rush of the fall and the shock of the cold water. To prove to myself that I can do it. But another part of me wants to step back, to stay safe on solid ground. I guess... I guess I'm not sure which part of me is going to win out.",
    "Therapist: What support do you think you'd need to take that leap?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd need to know that there are people who believe in me. Who will be there to catch me if I fall. My husband, of course. He's been my rock through all of this. And maybe... maybe a support group? People who've been through similar experiences and come out the other side. And... and I think I'd need to believe in myself more. To trust that I'm strong enough to handle whatever comes my way.",
    "Therapist: How might you start building that self-belief?",
    "Client: I suppose... I suppose I could start small. Set little goals for myself and celebrate when I achieve them. Maybe write down my thoughts and feelings, try to challenge the negative ones. And... and maybe I need to be kinder to myself. To remember that healing isn't linear, that it's okay to have bad days. That doesn't mean I'm weak or that I'm failing. It just means I'm human.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I think... I think I could try to share a bit of my story with my sister. She knows something happened, but I've never given her the details. Maybe opening up to her could be a first step towards speaking out more broadly. It's scary, but... but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: I feel... nervous, definitely. My palms are sweaty just thinking about it. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, determination? Like I'm finally taking control of my narrative. It's a small step, but it feels significant. And underneath all the nerves, there's a glimmer of hope. Maybe this is the start of something new, something better.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on strategies for managing my anxiety when I do share my story. And maybe we could explore more ways to channel this anger productively? I want to make sure it doesn't overwhelm me or push people away. Is that... is that something we can work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like I've just finished a hard workout. There's fatigue, but also a sense of accomplishment. And I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if it's just for a moment. Thank you for listening, for helping me work through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care."
