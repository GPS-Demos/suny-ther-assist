    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the day of the car accident. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm driving home from work. It's a cloudy day, and the traffic is heavy. I'm in the left lane, moving slowly. I can see the cars ahead of me, brake lights flashing on and off.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I hear a screeching sound behind me. In my rearview mirror, I see a car swerving wildly. It's coming up fast... too fast. My heart starts racing. I grip the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles turning white.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The car behind me slams into the vehicle in the lane next to me. There's a horrible crunching sound, and I see glass flying everywhere. I hit my brakes hard, but it's too late. The car that was hit spins out of control and crashes into my driver's side door.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything seems to slow down. I feel the impact, and my body jerks violently to the right. My head hits the window, and for a moment, everything goes dark. When I open my eyes, I'm disoriented. There's smoke, and I smell gasoline. People are screaming, but it sounds muffled, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry. This is really hard. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I try to move, but my left arm is pinned. I start to panic. I can't get out. I'm trapped. I hear sirens in the distance, but they seem so far away. I'm afraid the car might explode. I can't stop thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I close my eyes and try to calm down. I focus on my breathing, just like we've practiced. Suddenly, I hear a voice. Someone's at my window, telling me help is on the way. I feel a mix of relief and fear. What if they can't get me out in time?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But I'm okay. I know I'm here, in your office, not back in that car.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. The firefighters arrive and start working to get me out. I hear the sound of metal being cut. It's loud and jarring. They keep talking to me, telling me to stay calm. After what feels like hours, but was probably only minutes, they finally free me from the car.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Keep going.",
    "Client: As they pull me out, I see the full extent of the accident. There are multiple cars involved, people being treated on the ground. I feel guilty for being relatively okay when others are clearly badly hurt. The paramedics check me over and insist on taking me to the hospital. I'm in shock, I think. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything is a blur of tests and questions. My husband arrives, looking terrified. Seeing him makes it all real, and I break down crying. I can't stop thinking about how close I came to never seeing him or our kids again.",
    "Therapist: You've done an amazing job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced it head-on this time instead of running away from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I think it's getting a little easier each time we do this.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel like I need some time to process everything we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made excellent progress today."
