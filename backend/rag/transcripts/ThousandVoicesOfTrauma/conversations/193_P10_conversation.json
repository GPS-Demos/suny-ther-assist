    "Therapist: Welcome, Mia. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. There's a lot going on in my head. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. I keep thinking about what we're going to talk about, and my stomach feels like it's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in the village. It's early morning, and there's a chill in the air. I can smell smoke from cooking fires. I'm walking to the well to fetch water, like I do every day. The weight of the empty bucket feels familiar in my hand.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see the dusty path beneath my feet. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting long shadows. There are a few other women heading to the well too. We nod at each other, but don't speak. It's too early for conversation.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... normal. Tired, but calm. It's just another day. Or so I thought...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear something. A low rumble in the distance. At first, I think it's thunder, but... but it's not the rainy season. The sound gets louder, and I realize it's engines. Trucks. My heart starts to race.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? I'm getting scared now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The trucks appear on the horizon. They're moving fast, kicking up dust. People start shouting, running. I drop my bucket and turn to run back home, but... but I'm not fast enough. The trucks screech to a halt in the village center. Men with guns jump out. They're yelling, but I can't understand what they're saying. It's all happening so fast.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. They're grabbing people, shoving them into the trucks. I see my neighbor, she's trying to hold onto her daughter, but they're tearing them apart. I'm frozen. I can't move. Oh god, they're coming towards me.",
    "Therapist: Remember, this is a memory. You're here with me now. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. One of the men grabs my arm. His grip is so tight, it hurts. He's dragging me towards the truck. I'm screaming, begging, but he doesn't care. He throws me in with the others. There are so many of us, packed in like animals. The truck starts moving, and I can hear people crying, praying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mia. Stay with it.",
    "Client: We drive for hours. It's hot, stuffy. People are getting sick. I'm terrified, but also... numb? Like this can't be real. We finally stop, and they force us out. We're in a compound of some kind. There are other people here, looking just as scared and confused as we are.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. My mouth is dry. I feel... I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They... they separate us. Men on one side, women and children on the other. An older woman next to me is sobbing, calling out for her son. I want to comfort her, but I'm too scared to move. A man starts speaking to us in broken English. He says we belong to them now. That we'll work to pay off our \"debt.\" I don't understand. What debt? Why are we here?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Mia. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8? I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: They take us to a large building. Inside, it's dark and smells musty. There are rows of bunk beds. They tell us this is where we'll sleep. A woman hands out thin blankets and worn clothes. I clutch mine to my chest, feeling lost. I want to go home. I want my mom.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. They wake us before dawn, feed us barely enough to keep us going. We're put to work in fields, factories. Anyone who complains or tries to resist is beaten. I keep my head down, try to stay invisible. At night, I cry silently into my pillow, praying for rescue.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Mia?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. And scared. And so, so sad. Why did this happen to us?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You've been through a traumatic experience.",
    "Client: One day, maybe a week after we arrived, I see a chance. There's a gap in the fence, hidden by overgrown bushes. I wait until the guards are distracted, then I run. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst. I hear shouting behind me, but I don't look back. I just run and run until my legs give out.",
    "Therapist: That took incredible courage. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6 now? I feel... I don't know. Proud, I guess? But also guilty for leaving the others behind.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex emotions. It's okay to feel them all.",
    "Client: I ended up in a small village. The people there were kind, even though they didn't understand me. They helped me contact the authorities. It took days, but finally, people came to help. I was able to go home, but... home didn't feel like home anymore. Everything had changed.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: I feel... lost. Like a part of me is still in that compound. I have nightmares. I jump at loud noises. I feel guilty for surviving when so many others didn't. How do I move on from this?",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time, Mia. You're taking important steps.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. If I'll ever stop looking over my shoulder or waking up in a cold sweat. I want to be okay, for my family, for myself, but it's so hard.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I... I think I need a break. This is a lot.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take some deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... [deep breath] Thank you for listening. For not judging me.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Mia. You've shown tremendous strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy weight, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. Remember, healing isn't linear. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do want to get better.",
    "Therapist: And you will. We'll continue to work on this together. For now, let's focus on grounding yourself. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the plant in the corner, your desk, the painting on the wall, the box of tissues, and my water bottle.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my necklace, the fabric of my shirt, and... the coolness of the air conditioning on my skin.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear the ticking of the clock, a car passing outside, and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Perfect. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: I smell... your coffee, I think? And the lavender air freshener.",
    "Therapist: Great job. Lastly, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: I can still taste the mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful, Mia. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: More... present. Less caught up in the memories. My heart isn't racing as much.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, you can use this grounding technique anytime you feel overwhelmed. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I'm pretty exhausted. But... thank you. For helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mia. You did the hard work here today. I'm proud of your courage and resilience. We'll continue to work on processing these experiences and developing coping strategies. Remember to be kind to yourself this week.",
    "Client: I'll try. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Mia."
