    "Therapist: Alright, Rahul, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can stop at any time. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. How distressed do you feel right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My heart's beating a bit faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the day of the car accident. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm in the passenger seat. My friend is driving. It's raining heavily, and the windshield wipers are struggling to keep up. The road is slick, and I can see headlights approaching in the distance. My palms are sweaty, and I'm gripping the door handle tightly.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The car in front of us suddenly brakes. My friend tries to stop, but we're skidding. Everything seems to slow down. I can hear the screech of tires and smell burning rubber. My body tenses up, and I brace for impact.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's definitely higher. Maybe a 60 or 65.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue with what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The impact is loud. Metal crunching, glass shattering. My body jerks forward, then slams back into the seat. The airbags deploy, and there's a strong chemical smell. I'm disoriented, my ears are ringing, and I taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. Completely helpless. I don't know if my friend is okay, and I can't seem to move. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe. It's like I'm trapped in a nightmare.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's just... it feels so real. After the initial shock, I start to panic. I'm calling out to my friend, but he's not responding. I smell gasoline, and I'm scared the car might catch fire. I'm trying to undo my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking so much.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing, and I feel a bit dizzy. My hands are clammy, and I'm starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. Where are you in the memory now?",
    "Client: I finally manage to get my seatbelt off. I turn to check on my friend, and he's slumped over the steering wheel. There's blood... so much blood. I feel sick to my stomach, and I'm trembling uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Rahul. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right. Okay. I... I hear sirens in the distance. People are shouting outside the car. Someone's trying to open my door, but it's jammed. I'm crying now, begging for help. The pain is starting to set in, and I'm scared I might lose consciousness.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefighters arrive. They're using tools to cut open the car. The sound is deafening, and sparks are flying everywhere. I'm still terrified, but there's a small sense of relief. When they finally get me out, the cold rain hits my face. It's... it's almost refreshing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's strange. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's come down to about 65.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job, Rahul. Let's start bringing you back to the present. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, takes a deep breath) Wow, that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did amazingly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but okay. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You showed incredible strength today."
