    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure what that means. Can you explain it a bit more? I'm feeling a bit nervous about what to expect.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit your traumatic experience in a safe environment. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the severe illness I went through. It was such a difficult time, and I'm not sure I'm ready to go back there. Will it be too overwhelming? How will this help me?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. How do you think revisiting might benefit you?",
    "Client: I suppose it could help me process what happened. But I'm scared of the emotions it might bring up. I've tried so hard to move past it all. Will this set me back?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. Remember, you're in control. What support do you need during this process?",
    "Client: I think I'd feel better if I knew I could stop at any time if it becomes too much. And maybe if we could have some grounding techniques ready, just in case. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use those strategies. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Maybe if we could start with just a small part of the experience? And if you could remind me that I'm here in the present, not back in the hospital. I sometimes lose track of where I am when I think about it too much.",
    "Therapist: That's a great suggestion. We'll start small and stay grounded. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little better, I think. Still nervous, but I understand the purpose more clearly now. I want to get better, to not let this illness define me anymore. I'm willing to try if you think it will help. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll guide you through recalling the event, focusing on sensory details. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is all new and a bit frightening. But I trust you, and I'm hoping this will help me move forward. Can we start with something small, like maybe just describing the day I first realized I was seriously ill?",
    "Therapist: That's a perfect starting point. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe that day."
