    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that moment when I found out about my sister's accident. It feels like opening a wound that's barely started to heal. I'm worried I'll fall apart or won't be able to handle it. And honestly, I'm not sure how this is supposed to help me. Won't it just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's discuss the purpose of this exercise.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to admit, my heart is racing just thinking about it. It's like I can already feel the panic setting in.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. This exercise aims to help you process the trauma safely.",
    "Client: Process it? But I've been trying to forget it. How is remembering it in detail going to help? I'm worried it'll just bring back all those feelings of helplessness and grief that I've been trying so hard to push down.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can reduce its power over you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I... I guess that makes sense. But it's scary. Really scary. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it. The idea of purposely bringing it all up... it's overwhelming. What if I can't stop crying? What if I have a panic attack?",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It helps to know you'll be here. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? Like, step by step? I think having a clear picture might help me feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll start with relaxation techniques, then you'll describe the memory in detail.",
    "Client: Describe it in detail? Oh god... I'm not sure I can do that. It's all such a blur in my mind. I remember the phone call, and then it's like everything went dark. How am I supposed to describe something I've tried so hard to forget?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll work through it together, focusing on manageable parts.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying to stay calm. It's just... this is bringing up so much. I keep thinking about my sister, about how I'll never see her again. It's like I'm right back in that moment when I first heard the news. How do I stop myself from getting completely overwhelmed by these feelings?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. We'll use grounding techniques to help you stay present.",
    "Client: Grounding techniques? Like what? I'm sorry for all the questions, I just... I need to feel prepared. This feels like such a big step, and I want to make sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: We'll use deep breathing, sensory focus, and positive affirmations. These help manage intense emotions.",
    "Client: That sounds helpful. I've used deep breathing before when I've had anxiety attacks, and it does help. I'm still nervous, but knowing we have these tools makes me feel a bit more confident. How long will this session last? And what happens if it gets too intense for me?",
    "Therapist: The session will last about 90 minutes. We can pause or stop anytime you need.",
    "Client: Ninety minutes... that's a long time to be in that headspace. But I guess that's the point, right? To really work through it? I'm trying to remind myself that this is for my own good, that it's part of healing. It's just... it's hard to voluntarily walk into something you know is going to be painful.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can significantly reduce your PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to hear that this could actually make a difference. I've been struggling for so long, and the idea that there might be a way to lessen these symptoms... it gives me hope. Even if it's scary, I think I'm ready to try. Can we start with some of those relaxation techniques now? I think I need to calm down a bit before we begin.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start with a brief breathing exercise to center yourself."
