    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Going back to those moments in the refugee camp. I can still hear the sounds, smell the dampness in the air. It's like I was there again, but this time, I could observe it from a distance. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. The constant, gnawing fear. I remember clutching my little brother's hand so tightly, afraid that if I let go, I'd lose him in the chaos. And the uncertainty... not knowing if we'd ever see our parents again or if we'd make it out alive. It's... it's overwhelming to revisit those feelings.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult, but different from before. I noticed my heart racing and my palms getting sweaty, just like back then. But I also felt... stronger? Like I could endure it without completely falling apart. I think... I think that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've always struggled with feeling safe, you know? Even now, living with my daughter and her family, I sometimes wake up in a panic, thinking I'm back there. But today, I felt like I could separate the past from the present a bit more. It's still scary, but I'm starting to see that I'm not that helpless little girl anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I've been carrying. Anger at the people who caused the conflict, at the unfairness of it all. But also, and this is hard to admit, some anger towards my parents for not protecting us better. I know it wasn't their fault, but... those feelings are there.",
    "Therapist: It's brave of you to acknowledge those complex emotions.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but I'm trying. I also noticed how much my chronic pain flares up when I think about these experiences. It's like my body remembers the stress and hardship. Is that common?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's quite common. How might you address this connection?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be more mindful of how I'm carrying this stress in my body. Perhaps some relaxation techniques or gentle exercises might help? And maybe... maybe talking more openly about these experiences instead of bottling them up could help too.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent strategies. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I'm... I'm ready. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I might be able to move past this. Not forget it, but... not let it control me anymore. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your resilience is clear. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. And that... that means everything."
