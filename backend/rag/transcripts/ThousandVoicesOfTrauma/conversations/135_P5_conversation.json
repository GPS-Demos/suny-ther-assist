    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm alright, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. I mean, I'm nervous, but I want to get better. It's just... the thought of reliving those combat experiences... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? I've worked so hard to keep these memories at bay, and now we're deliberately bringing them up. It feels... counterintuitive, I guess.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: It makes sense, but it's still scary. I've spent years trying to forget, and now you're asking me to remember. It's like... it's like willingly walking into a minefield, you know? But I trust you, Dr. Thompson. If you think this will help, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, John. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will happen? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be guiding me through it? And... and what happens if it gets too intense? Can we stop if I need to?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You'll describe the memory while I guide you. We can pause anytime. How's that?",
    "Client: Okay, that's... that's reassuring. I appreciate that we can stop if needed. I'm still nervous, but knowing you'll be there guiding me helps. I just hope I can do this without... without falling apart completely.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel apprehensive. Remember, you're in control. What else is on your mind?",
    "Client: I guess I'm wondering about the aftermath. After we do this, will I be okay to drive home? Will I be able to function normally? I run my own business, and I can't afford to be... incapacitated, you know?",
    "Therapist: We'll end with grounding exercises. You'll have time to decompress. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I'm glad we're not just diving in and then I'm on my own. It's reassuring to know we'll have a cool-down period. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a big step. This work is challenging but vital for healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this. Just... just promise me you'll be here the whole time, alright? I don't think I could face this alone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely, John. I'll be right here with you throughout. Let's start with a deep breath..."
