    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. I can see the street corner where it happened. There's a group of kids from school, maybe five or six of them. They're laughing and pointing at me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: They're getting closer now. I can hear them saying things like \"loser\" and \"freak.\" My heart is starting to race a little. I'm trying to walk away, but my legs feel heavy.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: More anxious. Maybe a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of them, the biggest guy, he's right in front of me now. He's shoving me, and I stumble backward. I can feel my face getting hot, and my hands are shaking. I... I want to run, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing great. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The big guy, he's yelling in my face now. I can smell his breath. He's saying... he's saying I'm worthless, that no one likes me. The others are laughing. I feel so small, so helpless. My chest is tight, and I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. A 9, maybe even a 10. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... okay. I'll try. The big guy pushes me hard, and I fall. I can feel the rough concrete on my hands. They're all standing over me, laughing. I'm so humiliated, so scared. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this bravely. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see a police car pull up. At first, I feel relieved, but then... the officer, he just looks at us and drives away. He saw me on the ground, surrounded by them, and he did nothing. I feel... I feel betrayed, abandoned.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Helpless. My SUDS is still at 9, but it's different now. Less fear, more rage.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. Keep going.",
    "Client: The bullies, they're laughing even harder now. One of them says, \"See? Even the cops don't care about you.\" I'm still on the ground, and I can feel tears starting. I'm so angry at everyone - the bullies, the cop, myself for being weak.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropping a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I'm still upset, but I'm also feeling... I don't know, resigned?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: They eventually get bored and walk away, still laughing. I pick myself up, dust off my clothes. I'm shaking, but I manage to walk home. I feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I got through telling it?",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You did excellently. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves."
