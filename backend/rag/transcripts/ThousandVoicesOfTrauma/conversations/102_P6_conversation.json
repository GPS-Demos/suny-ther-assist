    "Therapist: Okay, Carlos, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the earthquake.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm back in my apartment. It's early morning, and I'm getting ready for work. Suddenly, everything starts shaking. The floor beneath me feels like it's moving in waves. I hear glass breaking and things falling off shelves. My heart is racing, and I can't think straight.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The shaking gets worse. I'm trying to get to the doorway, but I can barely stand. I hear screaming from outside. The power goes out, and it's dark. I'm terrified that the building might collapse. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I can feel my heart pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The quake seems to last forever. When it finally stops, I'm frozen in place. I can hear sirens and people crying outside. I'm shaking uncontrollably, and I feel so alone. I... I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they're okay.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Right. Safe. Okay. I finally manage to leave my apartment. The hallway is a mess, and I have to climb over fallen furniture. When I get outside, it's chaos. Buildings are damaged, cars are crushed under debris. People are wandering around, looking shell-shocked. I feel... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My hands are sweating, and my stomach feels like it's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a difficult memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start walking, trying to find somewhere safe. But everything looks different, unfamiliar. I see injured people, and I want to help, but I don't know how. I feel... I feel guilty for being okay when others are hurt. And then... then I see this little girl, crying, all alone. She reminds me of my daughter, and I just... I break down.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (voice cracking) It's... it's a 10. I can barely speak. My chest hurts, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I think so. I approach the little girl. She's speaking Spanish, asking for her mom. I try to comfort her, but I feel so inadequate. We sit there, amidst the rubble, waiting for help. Hours pass. The sun gets higher, and it's hot. I'm thirsty, hungry, and exhausted. But mostly, I feel... I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8? I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Carlos. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's like... like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but... I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: We'll end here. Take a moment to ground yourself."
