    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the cult... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The constant, gnawing fear. I remember being so afraid of disappointing the leader, of being punished. It's like I can still feel the pit in my stomach, you know? And the shame... God, the shame of realizing how much control I'd given up, how much I'd let them manipulate me. It's hard to face that.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those memories today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. At first, I felt like I was right back there, like it was happening all over again. My heart was racing, and I could feel myself starting to sweat. But then... it was strange. As I kept talking, it was like I could start to see it from a distance. Like I was watching it happen to someone else. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. How do you interpret that shift?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm starting to process it? Like, I'm not completely caught up in the emotion of it anymore. But it's still hard. I keep thinking about how much time I lost, how many years I wasted believing their lies. And the physical abuse... it's still so vivid. I can almost feel the bruises.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this connect to your symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having these nightmares, you know? Always about being trapped, being hurt. And during the day, I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. I think... I think maybe it's all connected. The fear from back then, it's still with me.",
    "Therapist: That's an important connection. What else?",
    "Client: I've been pushing my wife away. I think... I think I'm afraid of being controlled again, of being hurt. But she's not them. She loves me. I need to remember that.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable realization. How might you use this insight?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to talk to her more. About what I've been through, about why I sometimes pull away. And maybe... maybe I need to let her in more. Trust her. It's scary, but... I want to.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a weight I've been carrying. It's still there, but... it's not crushing me anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think helped create that shift?",
    "Client: I think... just talking about it. Facing it head-on instead of trying to avoid it. And... and knowing that you're here, listening, not judging. It helps me feel less... alone, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that, and I'm here now, working through it. It's hard, but... I'm doing it. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to let people in again. To trust again. It's terrifying, but... I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I'm going to try to be more open with my wife. And... I think I need to keep doing this, keep facing these memories. It's painful, but I can see now that it's helping. And maybe... maybe I'll try to reconnect with some old friends. People I pushed away when I was in the cult. It's scary, but... I miss them.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I'm... I'm ready. I want my life back, you know? I want to feel like me again. So yeah, I'm in. It's not going to be easy, but... I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's commendable, John. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. I'm pretty drained, to be honest. But thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. We'll continue next session. Take care."
