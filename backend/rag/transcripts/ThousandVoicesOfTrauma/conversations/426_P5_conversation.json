    "Therapist: Hello Rahul, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Patel. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the accident lately.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. What exactly is imaginal exposure? It sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting the trauma memory in a safe environment. We'll go through it step-by-step. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly, it sounds scary. I've been trying so hard not to think about the accident. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. This actually helps process the memory. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Yeah... What if I panic during the exercise? Or what if I can't handle reliving it?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We can pause anytime. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I guess I'm worried about how I'll feel afterward. Will I be able to function normally?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging, but many find relief. We'll debrief and ensure you're stable before leaving.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, Dr. Patel. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory in detail. I'll guide you through it. It may be emotional, but that's okay.",
    "Client: I see. And this will help with my PTSD symptoms? Like the nightmares and anxiety?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can significantly reduce symptoms over time. Your bravery in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. How long will the exercise last?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We'll start small and build up. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate your patience with all my questions, Dr. Patel. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Let's start by getting comfortable. Take a deep breath..."
