    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Rodriguez. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget it. Why do we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. This exercise helps process the trauma. Are you ready to try?",
    "Client: I guess so... but I'm really nervous. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about that day, I feel so helpless. The ground shaking, buildings crumbling... people screaming. It's overwhelming. And then there's the guilt of surviving when so many others didn't.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How do you think revisiting this might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it could help me stop avoiding those memories? It's affected my life so much. I can't even watch movies with earthquakes anymore. And loud noises... they send me into a panic.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Exposure can reduce those reactions over time. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, but I'm scared. What do I need to do?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, focus on the memory, and describe it aloud. I'll guide you through.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. But please, if it gets too much, can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. Ready when you are.",
    "Client: *Takes a deep breath* Here goes..."
