    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: It was a devastating earthquake that hit our town five years ago. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to violent shaking. The walls were creaking, and I could hear things falling and breaking all around us. My wife and I jumped out of bed, and I grabbed her hand as we tried to make our way to the doorframe. The floor was moving so much it felt like we were on a boat in rough seas.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As we stood there, holding onto each other and the doorframe, I could hear our neighbors screaming. The power went out, and suddenly we were in complete darkness. The shaking seemed to go on forever. I was terrified that the house would collapse on us at any moment. I kept thinking about our children and grandchildren, wondering if they were safe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the smell of dust and the sound of car alarms going off outside. When the shaking finally stopped, we were too afraid to move. We just stood there in the darkness, listening to the aftershocks and the sounds of distress from outside. I felt so helpless and vulnerable. It was like the world I knew had suddenly become unpredictable and dangerous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I was sweating profusely. My legs felt weak, and I was shaking uncontrollably. I had this overwhelming urge to run, to get out of the house, but I was paralyzed with fear. My mouth was dry, and I felt nauseous. It was like my body was in full panic mode.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those sensations. You're safe here.",
    "Client: As dawn broke, we finally ventured outside. The scene was surreal. Houses were damaged, roads were cracked, and people were wandering around in shock. Our beautiful town looked like a war zone. I saw my neighbor's house had partially collapsed, and I heard cries for help. I wanted to do something, but I felt so overwhelmed and powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: We spent the next few days in a makeshift shelter at the local school. The aftershocks kept coming, and each time I felt that same panic rise up in me. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. I kept replaying that night in my mind, thinking about what we could have done differently. The guilt was overwhelming - why did we survive when others didn't? It felt like the ground beneath my feet would never be stable again.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Continue.",
    "Client: In the weeks that followed, I struggled to return to normal life. Every little shake or loud noise would send me into a panic. I became hyper-vigilant, always watching for signs of danger. I couldn't concentrate at work, and I started withdrawing from my family and friends. The world just didn't feel safe anymore. It's been five years, but sometimes it feels like it just happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it brings back a lot of those feelings - the fear, the helplessness, the anxiety. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've survived something terrible and I'm still here. It's hard to explain. I still have nightmares sometimes, and I get anxious when I see earthquake scenes in movies or on the news. But I'm trying to focus on the fact that we made it through, that we're okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's pause here."
