    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories, they're so vivid now. I can almost smell the musty room where they kept us. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's coming up for you most strongly right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Intense fear. I remember feeling so helpless, like I was trapped in a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. I keep seeing their faces, the men who... who hurt us. They looked so normal, you know? Like anyone you'd pass on the street. That's what scares me the most sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that fear feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like ice in my veins. My muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I feel like I can't catch my breath properly. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's how I felt back then, always on edge, always waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me? Why couldn't I stop it?\" I know it's not logical, but part of me still feels like I should have done more to escape or fight back. And then I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. It's a mess of thoughts, really. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm angry. So, so angry. At the traffickers, obviously, but also at the world for letting this happen. At the people who looked away or didn't believe us. Even at myself, sometimes, for being vulnerable. It's like a fire in my chest, this anger. But it's mixed with sadness too. I've lost so much - my innocence, years of my life, trust in people. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: They're... different. Still intense, but I think I can handle them better now. Before, I'd shut down completely when these memories came up. Now, it's painful, but I can stay present. I'm more aware of my surroundings, of the fact that I'm here, safe, talking to you. It's progress, I guess, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to that change?",
    "Client: Honestly? This therapy. Talking about it, facing it head-on instead of trying to bury it. It's been hard, really hard, but it's also been... freeing, in a way. I'm learning that I can feel these intense emotions without being completely overwhelmed by them. And the breathing exercises you taught me have been a lifesaver.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad those have been helpful. What else has been supportive for you?",
    "Client: My support group has been amazing. Hearing other survivors' stories, knowing I'm not alone... it helps. And my daughter, even though she doesn't know all the details, her love and support mean everything. Oh, and my art!

I feel more grounded, more present in my body. It's exhausting, facing these memories, but I also feel a bit proud of myself for doing it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Maria. What would you like to focus on in our remaining time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk about coping strategies for when these memories come up outside of therapy. Sometimes they hit me out of nowhere, and I want to be better prepared to handle them.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Shall we start with reviewing some grounding techniques?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I find those really helpful, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or disconnected. And maybe we could talk about how to handle nightmares? They've been pretty intense lately, especially after sessions like this.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's begin with a quick grounding exercise now..."
