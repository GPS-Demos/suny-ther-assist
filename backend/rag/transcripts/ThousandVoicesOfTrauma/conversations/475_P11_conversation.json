    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That was intense.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. Take your time.",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's weird, you know? I wasn't even in combat, but reliving that neglect... it felt like I was back there, helpless and alone. My heart's still pounding.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It was so... deafening. I could hear my own heartbeat, my own breathing. No one coming to check on me, no one caring. It's like I was invisible.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: (pauses) I guess... I still feel invisible sometimes. Like at work, I'll have ideas but I don't speak up. I'm afraid no one will listen or care, just like back then.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else?",
    "Client: And the anxiety... it's always there, this fear that I'm not good enough, that I'll be abandoned again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to face that memory today?",
    "Client: Scary as hell, to be honest. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived that. I'm here now, talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. (chuckles nervously) It's just... it's hard to feel strong when you're remembering feeling so weak, you know?",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, in the memory, I felt so small and powerless. But now, talking about it, I realize I've come a long way. I have my own place, a job... I'm not that helpless kid anymore.",
    "Therapist: How might this realization impact your recovery?",
    "Client: (thoughtfully) Maybe... maybe I can start trusting myself more? Like, if I survived that, I can handle more than I give myself credit for. It's just hard to believe sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's weird, but talking about it... it's like the memory loses some of its power. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many find that. How does it feel?",
    "Client: Relieving, I guess? But also scary. It's been a part of me for so long, you know? What if I let it go and I'm... I don't know, not me anymore?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to hold on, because it's familiar. But another part... it's like I can see a version of myself without all this weight. It's tempting.",
    "Therapist: How might your life look different?",
    "Client: (long pause) Maybe I'd speak up more at work. Or... or try dating again. God, that's terrifying to even think about. But also... kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're seeing new possibilities.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's like... for the first time in a while, I'm curious about what could be, instead of just trying to survive each day. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: (laughs softly) I think it is. It's small, but... it feels big, you know? Like maybe there's hope after all.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: Scared, but... ready, I think. It's not easy, but if it means I can feel like this more often - like there's hope - then I want to keep going. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your courage is commendable.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I never thought I'd be here, talking about this stuff. It's hard, but... I'm glad I am. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What's going through your mind now?",
    "Client: Just... gratitude, I guess. For this space, for the chance to work through this. And... a little pride, maybe? Like, I'm doing something hard, but important. It feels good.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. (yawns) Sorry, I'm suddenly exhausted. Is that normal after these sessions?",
    "Therapist: It's common. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some time to process all this. But I want to keep going. Can we schedule another session soon?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
