    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you start by describing the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about five years ago. I was visiting family in my home country when an earthquake struck. We were in a tall apartment building, and suddenly everything started shaking violently. I remember the sound of glass shattering and people screaming...",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your distress right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about 40. My heart is starting to race a bit just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The building was swaying, and I could hear creaking noises. I grabbed my nephew and we huddled under a doorway. The power went out, and it was pitch black. I could feel the floor moving beneath us, and I was terrified the whole building would collapse...",
    "Therapist: And your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about 60. I'm feeling a bit shaky, and my palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, the shaking stopped. We stumbled down the stairs in the dark, tripping over debris. When we got outside, it was chaos. Buildings had crumbled, cars were crushed under fallen concrete. I saw people injured, bleeding... God, there was so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I can't shake the image of this woman I saw. She was trapped under a collapsed wall, screaming for help. I wanted to do something, but I was frozen. I just stood there, watching her suffer. I feel so guilty...",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's at 85. I feel sick to my stomach, and my head is pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's a tough memory. You're handling it bravely.",
    "Client: We spent the night in a makeshift camp in a park. The aftershocks kept coming, and with each one, I thought, \"This is it. We're all going to die.\" I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. I just sat there, holding my nephew, waiting for the next tremor...",
    "Therapist: And your distress now?",
    "Client: It's actually gone down a bit, maybe to 70. I'm still shaky, but talking about it... it's helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. No power, limited water. The streets were full of debris and... and bodies. The smell was awful. I kept having nightmares, reliving the quake over and over. Even after I came back home, I couldn't shake the fear. Every little vibration made me panic...",
    "Therapist: How about now? Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's around 60 now. I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I'm finally letting this out.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. You're doing great.",
    "Client: You know, I've never really talked about this in detail before. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, very. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm at about 50. Still anxious, but I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've been carrying this weight for years, and now I'm finally putting it down.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Well done."
