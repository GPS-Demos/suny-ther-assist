    "Therapist: Welcome, Ahmad. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like there's a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this at your own pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm working on some paperwork for my business. The house is quiet, just the sound of my laptop keys...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a... a loud crash. It startles me. I jump up, knocking over my coffee mug. The liquid spills across my papers, but I don't care. I'm frozen, listening...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. I'm... I'm terrified. I know something's wrong, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. It's intense.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Remember to breathe. What do you hear next?",
    "Client: I hear... footsteps. Heavy, unfamiliar footsteps. They're coming from the kitchen. Oh God, someone's in my house. I... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Ahmad. You're safe here. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I grab my phone. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold it. I'm trying to dial 911, but I keep messing up the numbers. I'm so scared they'll hear me...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What happens as you're trying to call?",
    "Client: I hear them moving through the house. Things are being knocked over. I hear... I hear a man's voice. He's angry, swearing. Another voice responds. There are at least two of them. I finally get the call to connect, but I'm whispering. I'm afraid they'll hear me...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel like I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm telling the dispatcher what's happening. My voice is shaking. I'm trying to be quiet, but I'm panicking. Then... then I hear them coming closer. They're in the hallway now. I can see the shadows under the door...",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. I'm convinced they're going to find me and kill me. I'm alone, and no one's coming to help me. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door... the door bursts open. Two men rush in. They're wearing masks. One has a gun. I... I drop the phone. I raise my hands. I'm begging them not to hurt me. My voice doesn't even sound like my own...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Ahmad?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My hands are clammy. It feels so real...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. On a scale of 0 to 100, where's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. It's really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're yelling at me. Asking where the safe is. I tell them I don't have one. The one with the gun hits me with it. I fall to the ground. My head is spinning. I can taste blood in my mouth...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I see the carpet. It's so close to my face. I can smell the coffee I spilled earlier. My cheek is pressed against the floor. It's cold. I hear them ransacking the room. Drawers opening, things crashing. I'm... I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Ahmad. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. Feel your breath going in and out. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: They're... they're getting angrier. They can't find what they're looking for. One of them grabs me, pulls me up. He's shouting in my face. His breath smells like cigarettes. I'm... I'm crying. Begging them to leave...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there are sirens. They panic. The one holding me throws me down. I hit my head on the coffee table. Everything goes fuzzy. I hear them running, the back door slamming. Then... silence.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock. My head is throbbing. I can't move. I'm just lying there, listening to the sirens get closer. I'm... I'm relieved, but also terrified they might come back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Ahmad. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. The worst part is over, but I still feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. What happens when the police arrive?",
    "Client: I hear them at the door. They're calling out. I try to answer, but my voice is weak. They find me on the floor. There's a flurry of activity. Paramedics come in. They're checking me, asking questions. I can barely focus...",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking and feeling during this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Grateful to be alive, but also... angry. Why me? Why my home? I feel violated, vulnerable. I can't stop shaking...",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer, but still shaken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: They take me to the hospital. Everything's a blur of tests and questions. I keep replaying it in my head. I can't shake the image of that gun in my face...",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on the fact that I survived. That I'm safe now. But it's hard. I keep thinking about what could have happened...",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How does it feel to talk about this now?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. But also, somehow... relieving? Like I'm finally letting it out instead of keeping it bottled up inside.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Ahmad. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50. I feel drained, but also... lighter? If that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does make sense. You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I'm exhausted, but I feel like I've faced it. It's still scary, but maybe a little less so now.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today, Ahmad. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* Thank you. This was hard, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, focus on self-care for the rest of the day.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Ahmad. Remember, you're stronger than you think. We'll end here for today."
