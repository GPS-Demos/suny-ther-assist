    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? I'm anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the incident with the police.",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from class. It was dark, and I heard footsteps behind me. Suddenly, someone grabbed my arm. I turned and saw it was a police officer. He started yelling at me, asking what I was doing there. I tried to explain, but he wouldn't listen. He... he slammed me against the wall. I can feel the rough bricks on my cheek...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: He was so angry. I could smell alcohol on his breath. He kept shouting, calling me names. I was terrified. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I thought he was going to hurt me badly. I... I started crying, begging him to let me go.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Around 75. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he twisted my arm behind my back. The pain was intense. I screamed, and that seemed to snap him out of it. He let go and stumbled back. I fell to the ground, sobbing. I was so confused and scared. I couldn't understand why this was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel sick to my stomach. My SUDS is probably 85. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here now, safe in this room.",
    "Client: I... I ran home after that. I was shaking so badly I could barely get my key in the door. Once inside, I just collapsed on the floor. I felt so helpless, so violated. I kept replaying it in my head, wondering what I did wrong, why he targeted me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I didn't tell anyone for days. I was too ashamed, too scared. I had bruises on my arm and face, and I lied to everyone about how I got them. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every time I saw a police car, I'd have a panic attack. It... it changed everything for me.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70 now? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved to have said it all out loud?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I have a headache coming on. But my breathing is steadier now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What do you see in the room?",
    "Client: I see... I see your bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the soft blue of the walls. It's... it's helping me feel more present.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55. I feel more... more here, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. You did very well today, Sarah. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... but I think it helped. It was hard, but I feel like I faced something important. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises."
