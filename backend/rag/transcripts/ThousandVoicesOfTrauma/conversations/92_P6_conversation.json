    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you start by describing the natural disaster experience and give me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... um, it was a massive earthquake. I was in my dorm room when it hit. The whole building started shaking violently. I remember the sound of glass shattering and people screaming. I... I froze. I couldn't move. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. It's... it's hard to talk about. I'd say my SUDS is about a 7 right now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Let's continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to go on forever. I could hear things falling and breaking all around me. I managed to crawl under my desk, but I was terrified the ceiling would collapse. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if they were okay. My hands were shaking so much... I... I couldn't even call them. I felt so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Probably an 8. My palms are sweating, and my heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the shaking stopped, I was too scared to move. I stayed under the desk for what felt like hours. When I finally got the courage to look outside, it was... devastating. The campus was in ruins. Buildings had collapsed, trees were uprooted, and there were injured people everywhere. I... I saw someone trapped under a fallen concrete slab. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear. I feel so ashamed about that now.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I eventually made it outside. The air was thick with dust, and sirens were blaring everywhere. I remember the smell of gas and smoke. People were crying and calling out for help. I felt so overwhelmed and useless. I couldn't process what was happening. It was like being in a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.5. My hands are shaking, but talking about it... it's helping a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I wandered around campus in a daze. I saw injured classmates, collapsed buildings... it was surreal. I finally found a group of students huddled together. We stayed there, trying to comfort each other. But I felt so guilty for being relatively unharmed when others were suffering. The aftershocks kept coming, and each one sent a new wave of panic through me. I... I've never felt so helpless and scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's like releasing some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it well. Continue.",
    "Client: We stayed there for hours until rescue teams arrived. The relief of seeing them... it was overwhelming. But even as they helped us, I couldn't shake the images of destruction and suffering. When I finally got in touch with my family, I broke down completely. I was safe, but I felt... changed. Like the world wasn't safe anymore. Even now, loud noises or sudden movements can trigger that fear.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've shared some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it helped. Talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like I'm starting to process it instead of just reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today. Well done."
