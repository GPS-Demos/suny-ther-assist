    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the refugee experience you mentioned last time?",
    "Client: Yes... It was when we first arrived at the refugee camp. The journey had been so long and difficult. We were exhausted, hungry, and scared. I remember the dust everywhere, the hot sun beating down on us. There were so many people, all looking lost and desperate. I felt completely overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As we entered the camp, I saw rows and rows of tents. The smell was awful - a mix of sweat, waste, and despair. I was holding my daughter's hand tightly, afraid to let go. We were directed to a registration area, but the line was so long. People were pushing and shoving, trying to get ahead. I felt panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... We waited for hours in that line. My daughter was crying from hunger and exhaustion. I felt so helpless, unable to provide for her basic needs. When we finally reached the front, they took our names and gave us a small tent to share with another family. It was barely big enough for two people, let alone four. I remember feeling so defeated and humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: That first night in the camp was terrible. The tent was stifling hot, and we could hear people arguing and children crying all around us. I couldn't sleep, worried about what would happen to us. Would we ever have a normal life again? I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The next morning, we had to line up again for food and water. The rations were so small, barely enough to keep us going. I saw people fighting over extra portions, and it made me sick to my stomach. I kept thinking about our home, our life before, and how everything had changed so suddenly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the days went by, life in the camp became a monotonous struggle. The heat was unbearable, and there was no privacy. We had to use communal bathrooms that were filthy and dangerous, especially at night. I was constantly afraid for my daughter's safety. There were rumors of assaults and thefts, and I couldn't relax for a moment.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: One day, about a week after we arrived, there was a commotion in the camp. A fight had broken out over water distribution. I saw people getting hurt, and the peacekeepers seemed overwhelmed. I grabbed my daughter and we hid in our tent, but I could hear the chaos outside. It reminded me of why we had fled in the first place, and I felt trapped and hopeless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling shaky. My heart is racing, and I can almost smell the camp again. It's like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I remember the constant fear, the uncertainty of each day. Would we have enough to eat? Would we ever leave the camp? The worst part was seeing the light fade from my daughter's eyes. She stopped playing, stopped smiling. It broke my heart.",
    "Therapist: You're very strong. Keep going.",
    "Client: We spent three months in that camp before we were finally processed for relocation. Those were the longest months of my life. Every day was a struggle to maintain hope, to keep believing that things would get better. When we finally left, I felt relief but also guilt for those we left behind. Even now, years later, I sometimes wake up thinking I'm still there.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I think it helps. It's like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to forget it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll stop here for today."
