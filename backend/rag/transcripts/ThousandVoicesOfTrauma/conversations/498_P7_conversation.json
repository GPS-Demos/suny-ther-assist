    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell sweat and dust in the air. There are tents everywhere, and people are moving around, looking lost and tired.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I see a group of men approaching. They look angry, intimidating. I feel my heart racing. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. One of them grabs my arm roughly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: His grip is so tight. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. I'm terrified. I can't breathe. I... I don't want to remember this part.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're doing great.",
    "Client: He's pulling me towards a secluded area behind some tents. I'm trying to resist, but I'm not strong enough. I can hear my own voice, pleading, begging him to stop. But he doesn't listen. He... he starts to...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) He's touching me. I feel so helpless, so ashamed. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I close my eyes, trying to shut everything out, but I can still feel his hands on me, hurting me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: It feels like it's lasting forever. The pain, the fear, the disgust... I'm shaking uncontrollably. When it's finally over, he just leaves me there, like I'm nothing. I curl up into a ball, feeling broken and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Angry. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced it and survived, again.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a bit easier each time. I just wish I could forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Remember, processing is part of healing. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit, and my stomach feels tight. But I'm okay. I think I need a moment to just... breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (after a pause) I'm feeling a bit calmer now. It's strange, but talking about it... it's like the memory loses some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's often part of the process. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thanks. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's still painful, but... I feel like I'm making progress. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Progress can feel both challenging and rewarding.",
    "Client: Yeah, that's exactly it. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment. I'm grateful for your support through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think I'm ready to end for today. It's been intense, but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. We'll continue next session."
