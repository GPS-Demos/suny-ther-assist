    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Susan?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy to go back to that night of the home invasion. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel a little on edge. But, um, I guess it wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it might be.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The sound of glass breaking when they first entered... it's so vivid in my memory. And then their footsteps. I remember lying there, frozen in my bed, just listening to those footsteps moving through my house. It's... it's terrifying to think about, even now.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel different today?",
    "Client: Well, it's still scary, but... I noticed I could breathe through it this time. I kept reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It's strange, but I felt a little more... in control? Like, I knew I could stop if I needed to, but I didn't need to. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I suppose... well, I've been so anxious about my home security since the invasion. Always checking locks, installing new alarms. But going through this memory, I realized that even in the worst moment, I survived. I got through it. Maybe I don't need to be quite so... hypervigilant all the time?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else?",
    "Client: I... I've been having nightmares about the invasion. But they're always worse than what actually happened. In the nightmares, I'm always hurt or... or worse. But reliving the real memory, I remember that I wasn't physically harmed. It was terrifying, yes, but I made it through unscathed. I wonder if that might help with the nightmares?",
    "Therapist: It could. How do you feel about continuing these exposures?",
    "Client: It's not easy, that's for sure. But... I think it's helping. Each time, it gets a little easier to face. And I'm starting to see how it might help me in my day-to-day life. I'm... I'm willing to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think... the realization that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived that night, and I'm surviving reliving it now. It's hard, but I'm doing it. And maybe, just maybe, I can use that strength to face other challenges in my life.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my daughter. Talking to her always helps me feel grounded. And maybe I'll take a long bath, try to relax a bit. Oh, and I'll make sure to do those breathing exercises we talked about if I start feeling anxious again.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I'm just grateful for this process, as difficult as it is. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm making progress. Like maybe I won't always be defined by what happened that night. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress, Susan. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you, Doctor. I... I know it's your job, but I really appreciate your guidance through all this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for my fears.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
