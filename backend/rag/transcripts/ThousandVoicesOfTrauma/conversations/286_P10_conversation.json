    "Therapist: Welcome, Mark. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 4 or 5 right now. Just thinking about it makes my stomach churn a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and take us to that day.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm at work. It's a normal Tuesday morning. I'm sitting at my desk, going through emails when suddenly two men in suits walk in. They... they're heading straight for me. My heart starts racing. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they show me their badges. FBI. I feel like I can't breathe. Everyone in the office is staring. One of them says, \"Mark Johnson, you're under arrest.\" I... I can't believe this is happening. It has to be a mistake.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're... they're putting handcuffs on me. The metal is cold. I can hear the click as they tighten them. I'm trying to ask what's going on, but my voice is shaky. They're leading me out of the office. My coworkers are whispering. I can see the shock on their faces. I feel... I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: We're in the elevator now. It's so quiet. I can hear my own heartbeat. It's so loud. We get to the lobby, and there are more agents waiting. They're escorting me out. I see people on the street stopping to stare. I want to disappear. I... I can't believe this is happening to me.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. There has to be some mistake.\" But also... \"What if it's not a mistake? What if I did something wrong without realizing it?\" I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're... they're putting me in the back of a black SUV. The seats are leather. It's cold. I can smell that new car smell, but it's making me nauseous. We start driving. I... I don't know where we're going. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We arrive at... at a federal building. They're taking me inside. Everything's a blur of corridors and security checkpoints. I'm... I'm fingerprinted. They take my photo. I feel like a criminal, but I don't even know what I've supposedly done.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My... my legs are shaky. My mouth is dry. I feel like I might throw up. They're putting me in an interrogation room now. It's... it's so cold. The chair is uncomfortable. I'm waiting... waiting for what feels like hours.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a solid 9 now. I can barely think straight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. An agent comes in. He's... he's talking about fraud charges. Something about the company I work for. I... I keep telling him I don't know anything about it. He doesn't believe me. He's... he's threatening me with years in prison if I don't cooperate.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Angry. Confused. I feel like my whole life is falling apart. I... I can't stop thinking about my wife, my kids. What will happen to them? Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're... they're telling me I have to spend the night in holding. I... I can't believe this. They're taking me to a cell. It's... it's small. Cold. The bed is just a metal slab with a thin mattress. The toilet is right there in the open. I... I feel so exposed. So vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"How did this happen? How did my life come to this?\" I'm... I'm worried sick about my family. Are they okay? Do they know what's happening? I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. A 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Deep, shaky breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm lying on the bed. It's so uncomfortable. I can hear other people in nearby cells. Some are crying. Some are angry. I... I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the faces of my wife and kids.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The... the night feels endless. I keep replaying everything in my mind, trying to figure out what went wrong. Morning comes, and I haven't slept at all. They... they bring me back to the interrogation room. More questions. More threats. I... I still don't know what's going on.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Scared. Angry. I feel like I'm in a nightmare I can't wake up from. They're... they're telling me they have evidence. That I should confess. But I... I didn't do anything wrong. I keep telling them that.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Finally... finally, my lawyer arrives. He... he talks to the agents. There's a lot of back and forth. I can barely focus. I'm... I'm so tired. So scared. Then... then suddenly, everything changes. The lawyer is telling me there's been a mistake. They... they got the wrong person.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved. But also... also so angry. How could they make a mistake like this? They've... they've put me through hell. I... I start crying. I can't help it. It's like all the fear and anger just comes pouring out.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7. I'm still shaky, but the relief is... is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: They're... they're apologizing. Saying it was a case of mistaken identity. But their words feel... empty. Hollow. They're releasing me, but I... I don't feel free. I feel... broken. Changed. As I walk out of the building, the sunlight hurts my eyes. I... I don't know how I'm going to face my family, my coworkers.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Ashamed. Even though I didn't do anything wrong, I feel... tainted somehow. Like everyone will look at me differently now. I... I don't know how to move past this.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I'm calming down, but I still feel... shaken.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today, Mark. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... also a bit relieved. Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like... like I'm starting to process it all.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. I... I think I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress today. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
