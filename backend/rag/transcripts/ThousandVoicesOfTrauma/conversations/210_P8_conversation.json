    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. The memory of being trapped during that cyclone, it just... it feels so real again. My heart is pounding, and I can almost hear the wind howling.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe, like the air is thick. I keep clenching my jaw, and my shoulders feel so tense. It's like my body is preparing for the worst all over again.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not safe. It could happen again.\" I know it's irrational, but part of me feels like I'm still in danger. And then there's this guilt... I survived when others didn't. Why me? I feel like I should have done more to help others.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you were actually in the cyclone?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but different. Back then, it was pure terror. Now, it's more like a mix of fear and sadness. I remember feeling so helpless, like my life was completely out of my control. Now, I feel angry too. Angry at nature, at the world, at myself for still being affected by this.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: The hardest part is... it's realizing how much it still affects me. I thought I'd moved on, you know? But going back there in my mind, it's like opening a floodgate. All these emotions I've been pushing down, they're all rushing back. And it's not just the cyclone. It's bringing up feelings from when I was imprisoned too. That same sense of powerlessness, of being trapped.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences connecting?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it before, but they do feel connected. In both situations, I felt completely powerless. During the cyclone, nature was in control. In prison, it was the system. Both times, I couldn't escape, couldn't change what was happening. It's like... like I'm always waiting for the next disaster, the next time I'll be trapped.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I need... I need to feel grounded. Safe. I keep reminding myself that I'm here, in this room, that I'm okay. But it's hard. Part of me wants to run away, to escape these feelings. Another part knows I need to face them. I just... I wish I could shake this feeling of vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: How might facing these feelings help you move forward?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe if I can face them, they'll lose some of their power over me. It's exhausting, always being on edge, always waiting for the next disaster. If I can learn to sit with these feelings, maybe I can start to let go of some of this fear and guilt. Maybe I can start to feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: What strength do you see in yourself for engaging in this process?",
    "Client: Strength? I... I guess it does take strength to face this. I've been avoiding these memories for so long. It's easier to numb myself with substances than to feel all of this. But I'm here, I'm doing this work. That's something, right? Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that strength make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a strange feeling. There's a part of me that feels proud, I guess. Like maybe I'm not as broken as I thought. But there's also this fear. What if I'm not strong enough? What if I can't get through this? And then there's this tiny spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to work through these experiences?",
    "Client: It would mean... freedom, I think. Freedom from constantly looking over my shoulder, from feeling like a victim. Maybe I could start to enjoy life again, to be present with my partner without this cloud hanging over me. I could focus on my studies without these memories intruding. It's scary to think about, but also... exciting? Like there's a whole life waiting for me if I can just get past this.",
    "Therapist: How can we support you in taking steps towards that freedom?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I know I need to keep facing these memories, as hard as it is. Maybe we could work on some strategies for when I feel overwhelmed? And... I think I need to be honest with my partner about what I'm going through. I've been trying to handle it all on my own, but maybe letting them in could help. I just... I want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: That's a great starting point. Let's explore those ideas further next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. I'm... I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready to keep going with this. Thank you for... for helping me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible courage. We'll take it one step at a time."
