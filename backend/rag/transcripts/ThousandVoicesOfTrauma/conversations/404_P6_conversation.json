    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm there. It's hot, dusty. The air feels thick. I can hear distant explosions and the constant hum of generators. The smell of diesel fuel is overwhelming. I'm standing outside our makeshift hospital tent, taking a short break after a long surgery.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart is starting to race a bit. I can feel tension in my shoulders. The memory feels so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud boom nearby. Much closer than before. I see people running, shouting. There's smoke rising from a building about 200 meters away. I freeze for a moment, then my training kicks in. I run towards the explosion site, my mind racing with thoughts of potential casualties.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My mouth is dry. I can taste the dust in the air. My legs feel heavy as I run, like I'm moving through molasses. The chaos around me is deafening.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. This is... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) As I get closer, I see bodies. So many bodies. Some are moving, crying out for help. Others are... still. There's blood everywhere. The smell of burnt flesh hits me, and I feel like I'm going to be sick. But I can't stop. I have to help.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My chest feels tight. I can barely breathe. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay. I... I start triaging. My hands are moving automatically, checking pulses, applying tourniquets. There's a young girl, maybe 8 years old. Her leg is... it's gone. She's looking at me with these big, terrified eyes. I'm trying to stop the bleeding, but there's so much. I'm calling for help, but everyone's overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. Scared. I want to save her, but I don't know if I can. The guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. This is the worst part.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm working on her, talking to her, trying to keep her calm. But I can see the life fading from her eyes. She's slipping away, and there's nothing I can do. I failed her. I failed all of them.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) I can't... I can't do this anymore. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Let's start coming back to the present. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. But... it's not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: Good. Slowly open your eyes. Look around the room.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, breathing heavily) I'm... I'm here. But I can still see her face.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved?",
    "Therapist: Your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. We'll process this more next time."
