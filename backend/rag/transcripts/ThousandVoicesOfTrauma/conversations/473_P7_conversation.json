    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control and can stop anytime. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in the schoolyard. It's recess, and I can see a group of older kids approaching. My heart starts racing because I know what's coming. They've been targeting me for weeks now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader of the group, a tall boy with a mean smirk, starts taunting me. He's calling me names, saying I'm weak and pathetic. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my face getting hot with shame.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Suddenly, one of the other boys pushes me hard. I stumble backward and fall to the ground. The impact hurts, and I can feel the rough asphalt scraping my hands. They're all laughing now, pointing at me. I feel so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: As I try to get up, the leader kicks my backpack, scattering my books and papers all over the ground. I can hear the other kids in the playground laughing too. It feels like everyone is against me. I'm fighting back tears, determined not to cry in front of them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions.",
    "Client: I manage to stand up, but my legs are shaking. I want to say something, to stand up for myself, but the words won't come out. My throat feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally. That's when I see a teacher walking towards us from across the yard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The bullies see the teacher too, and they quickly back off. They're still smirking and whispering to each other, but at least they've stopped physically harassing me. The teacher asks if everything's okay, but I'm too embarrassed and scared to tell the truth. I just nod and start picking up my scattered belongings.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of relief that the teacher showed up, but also intense shame and anger. Anger at the bullies, but also at myself for not standing up to them. My hands are shaking as I gather my things, and I can feel tears starting to form in my eyes.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings.",
    "Client: The rest of the day is a blur. I can't concentrate in class, and I keep replaying the incident in my mind. I feel so alone and isolated. When I get home, I don't tell my parents what happened. I'm too ashamed and worried they might think I'm weak too.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave sharing this.",
    "Client: That night, I have trouble sleeping. Every time I close my eyes, I see their laughing faces and feel the shame all over again. I start dreading going to school, wondering when the next attack will come. It's like a constant weight on my chest, never knowing when or where they'll corner me next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Talking about it brings back a lot of those old feelings - the fear, the shame, the helplessness. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on for the first time. It's still painful, but maybe not as overwhelming as it used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy to revisit these memories, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to see that what happened wasn't my fault. Those bullies were the ones in the wrong, not me. I just wish I had known how to handle it better back then.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization.",
    "Client: You're right. I think I've carried this burden for so long, blaming myself. But now I can see that I was just a kid trying to survive a difficult situation. It doesn't make the memory less painful, but it does change how I view myself in it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. There's still some residual anxiety, but it's not as intense. I think I'm starting to see this experience from a different perspective, and that's helping me process it better.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Let's end here."
