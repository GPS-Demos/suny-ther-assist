    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaky, and my heart's still racing. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's weird because I'm here in this room with you, but part of me still feels trapped back there in that... that place.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: God, it's all jumbled. I keep seeing flashes of faces, you know? The other members, they looked so... devoted. And I remember thinking, \"Am I the crazy one here?\" Because everyone else seemed so sure, so committed. But then I remember the fear, the constant fear of doing something wrong, of disappointing the leaders. It's like I'm reliving that feeling of always being on edge, always watching my back.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like ice in my veins. My muscles are all tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I realize I'm clenching my teeth. And there's this pit in my stomach, like I'm about to be sick. It's the same feeling I had every day in the cult, especially when the leaders would single someone out for \"correction.\" God, I hated those sessions.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Anger. So much anger. At them for what they did, at myself for falling for it. And shame. Deep, gut-wrenching shame. I feel so stupid for not seeing through it all sooner. But there's also this... relief, I guess? Like, I'm remembering all this awful stuff, but I'm here now. I got out. It's over.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that it's over?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels this immense relief, like I can finally breathe again. But there's also this guilt, you know? Like, I got out, but what about the others who are still there? And then there's this fear that maybe it's not really over. What if they find me? What if I get pulled back in somehow? I know it sounds irrational, but...",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those concerns. What else?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing how much of myself I lost in there. My identity, my dreams, my relationships with family and friends. It's like I'm grieving for the person I used to be, and for all the time I lost. But at the same time, I'm starting to feel a tiny spark of... hope? Like maybe I can rebuild, create a new life for myself. It's terrifying, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: How does that spark of hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... warm. Like a small flame in my chest. It's fragile, and part of me is afraid to let it grow because what if it gets snuffed out? But it's there, and it feels good. It makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I can heal from all this. That I can learn to trust again, to form relationships, to pursue my own dreams without fear of punishment or shame.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I didn't even realize, but my breathing has slowed down. My shoulders have dropped a bit. I'm still shaky, but it's not as intense. It's like... it's like my body is starting to remember that I'm safe now. That this room, this conversation, it's all part of my journey to healing, not something to be afraid of.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when we started?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. When we started, I felt overwhelmed, like I was drowning in memories and emotions. Now, it's still intense, but it feels more... manageable? Like, I can look at these memories without being completely consumed by them. There's a bit of distance now, even though it's still painful. And I'm realizing that talking about it, as hard as it is, helps me make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: What does this tell you about your progress?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it shows that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face these memories and not fall apart completely. It's like, each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly hard, but... I'm doing it. I'm here, I'm talking about it, I'm feeling it. And I'm still standing. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you want to care for yourself now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some quiet time. Maybe a long bath when I get home, or a walk in the park. Something to ground myself in the present. And I want to write in my journal. Get all these thoughts and feelings out on paper. It helps me process, you know? And maybe... maybe I'll call my sister. I've been avoiding talking to my family, but I think I'm ready to start reconnecting, even if it's just a short call.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's hard, and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. But moments like this, where I can feel a shift, however small... it gives me hope. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim my life and find peace. It's a long road, but... I think I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. It's weird, but I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Not because it's easy, but because I can feel that it's helping. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
