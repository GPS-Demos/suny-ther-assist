    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about that incident with the police. It's like I can't escape it, even in my sleep.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It involves recounting the traumatic event in detail. It can help reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: Recounting it? I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. What if I panic?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. But why do we need to do this? Isn't it better to try and forget?",
    "Therapist: Actually, processing the memory can help reduce its power over you. It's challenging but effective.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... I've been trying so hard to keep it together, you know? For my partner, for my business. I'm afraid of falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is admirable. This process can help you regain control. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds... scary, but maybe necessary. I'm tired of feeling this way. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. You might feel strong emotions, but remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Present tense? Like it's happening now? That's... that's going to be tough. Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. We can pause anytime you need. Your comfort is important.",
    "Client: Okay. I think I can do this. It's just... I've never talked about it in detail before. Not even to my partner. I'm worried about how I'll react.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Remember, this is a step towards healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start slowly. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
