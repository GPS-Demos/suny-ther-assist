    "Therapist: Hello Mrs. Patel, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Lim. I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. My heart's been racing since I woke up this morning.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I know we're going to talk about the dog attack today. I've avoided thinking about it for so long. The idea of reliving it... it's terrifying. I'm worried I might completely fall apart or have a panic attack right here in your office.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's discuss the process to ease your worries.",
    "Client: Okay, that would be helpful. I mean, I trust you, Dr. Lim, but this whole thing just seems so daunting. I've spent years trying to forget that day, and now you want me to remember it in detail? It's hard to wrap my head around how that could possibly be helpful.",
    "Therapist: I understand. The goal is to process the memory safely, reducing its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. But how can we make sure it's safe? What if I get stuck in that terrifying moment and can't get out? I'm also a bit embarrassed... I'm old enough to be your mother, and here I am, scared of a memory.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid, regardless of age. We'll go at your pace, and I'll guide you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Lim. I suppose I should also mention that I'm worried about how this might affect my depression. It's been manageable lately, but I fear this could set me back.",
    "Therapist: We'll monitor your mood closely. This process often improves depression symptoms too.",
    "Client: Really? That's encouraging. I hadn't considered that it might help with my depression as well. Okay, so what exactly will we be doing? How does this imaginal exposure work?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory in present tense, focusing on sensory details and emotions. I'll record it for review.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. And you'll be recording it? I'm not sure how I feel about that. Will I have to listen to it later? The thought of hearing myself describe it... it's making me feel a bit queasy.",
    "Therapist: Yes, listening later is part of the process. It helps desensitize and process the memory.",
    "Client: I see. It's a lot to take in. I'm trying to be brave, but I can feel my hands shaking just thinking about it. How long will this take? Will we do this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for about 30-45 minutes today, then process your experience. It's not every session.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I was worried it would consume all our sessions. Dr. Lim, you've been so kind and patient with me. I'm still scared, but I think I'm ready to try. Can you tell me one more time why this is important?",
    "Therapist: This helps your brain process the trauma, reducing PTSD symptoms and improving your quality of life.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Lim. Your explanation helps. I'm nervous, but I trust you. I'm ready to face this memory and hopefully start healing. Let's begin.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your support, Dr. Lim. Let's do this."
