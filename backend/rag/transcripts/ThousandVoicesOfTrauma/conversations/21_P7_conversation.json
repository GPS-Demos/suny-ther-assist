    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my military experiences today, and it's not easy for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... these memories, they're so vivid. I can still hear the explosions, smell the smoke...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, it was during my second tour in Afghanistan. We were on a routine patrol when suddenly... (voice trembles) There was this deafening blast. I remember being thrown to the ground, my ears ringing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The air was thick with dust and smoke. I couldn't see anything at first. Then I heard the screams... my fellow soldiers... they were calling for help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I tried to get up, but my leg was injured. I dragged myself towards the voices. That's when I saw them... (pauses, visibly distressed)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: There was so much blood... Private Johnson, he was barely recognizable. And Sergeant Miller... (starts to cry) He was calling for his mother. I... I couldn't help them...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I felt so helpless. I was supposed to protect them, you know? But I couldn't do anything. I just lay there, listening to their cries getting weaker...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: It felt like hours before help arrived. The medics were working frantically, but I knew... I knew some of them wouldn't make it. The guilt... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I could have done more. If I had been more alert, maybe I could have spotted the IED. Maybe they'd still be alive...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for what happened.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. The nightmares, they still come. I see their faces, hear their voices. It's like I'm back there all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part is, I survived. Why me? Why did I get to come home when they didn't? It doesn't seem fair. And now, here I am, years later, still struggling to move on while their families have had to accept their loss.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. It's okay to express them.",

    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I know we're almost out of time, but I wanted to say... I appreciate your patience with me. It's not easy to relive these moments, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Singh. Well done today."
