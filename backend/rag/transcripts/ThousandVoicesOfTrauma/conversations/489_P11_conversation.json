    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I got the diagnosis... it's like I'm right back there in that sterile hospital room. The smell of disinfectant, the harsh fluorescent lights... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of fear. When the doctor said \"stage 3 cancer,\" it felt like the floor dropped out from under me. I've faced a lot in my 72 years, but nothing prepared me for that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does it feel to revisit that memory now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. My heart's still racing a bit. But, you know, there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like, I survived that moment. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization.",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose it is. It's just... when I got that diagnosis, all I could think about was how I'd already lost so much. My wife left years ago, I was living with a roommate at my age, and now this? It felt like the universe was playing some cruel joke on me.",
    "Therapist: How do you see that moment connecting to your current struggles?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been so focused on what I've lost that I haven't really acknowledged what I've gained. My part-time work keeps me busy, and my roommate's actually become a good friend. But that fear from the diagnosis, it's like it's always there in the background.",
    "Therapist: You're noticing important links.",
    "Client: I am, aren't I? It's like... every time I feel that twinge of chronic pain, I'm right back in that moment of diagnosis. But maybe... maybe I can use that as a reminder that I've overcome tough things before?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective shift.",
    "Client: It feels good to look at it that way. You know, growing up in Africa, we faced natural disasters that seemed insurmountable. But our community always came together. Maybe I need to tap into that resilience again.",
    "Therapist: How might you do that?",
    "Client: I could... reach out more. To my community here. Maybe even to my ex-wife. Not to reconcile, but to find closure. And definitely to my doctors. Take a more active role in my treatment instead of just feeling like a victim.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a strong plan.",
    "Client: It does, doesn't it? I'm feeling... I don't know, more empowered? Like I'm not just a passive recipient of bad news anymore. This illness doesn't define me. I've got more fight in me than I realized.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable insight.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but... I'm starting to see the value in these sessions. Facing these memories head-on is terrifying, but it's also... liberating, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I need to stop seeing my diagnosis as an ending. It's a challenge, sure, but it's also an opportunity to rediscover my strength. And to appreciate the good things I do have in my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: It is. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows progress.",
    "Client: Progress... I like the sound of that. Thank you, doctor. Really. This... this helps more than I can say."
