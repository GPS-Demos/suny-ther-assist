    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the natural disaster you experienced.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember it was a sunny day when the earthquake hit. I was in my dorm room studying for finals. Suddenly, everything started shaking violently. Books fell off shelves, and I could hear screaming from the hallway. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to last forever. I crawled under my desk, terrified. The walls were cracking, and I thought the building might collapse. I couldn't stop thinking about my family back home, wondering if they were okay.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember the overwhelming fear, the uncertainty. When the shaking finally stopped, I was too scared to move. I could hear sirens outside, and people crying in the hallway. I felt so alone and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally gathered the courage to leave my room. The hallway was a mess, with debris everywhere. Some students were injured, and others were trying to help. I wanted to do something, but I felt paralyzed. The guilt of not being able to help still haunts me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: We were evacuated to a nearby park. The aftershocks kept coming, and each one brought back that initial terror. I couldn't reach my family for hours, and I kept imagining the worst. The uncertainty was unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're describing it well. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the days that followed, the campus was in chaos. Classes were cancelled, and many students left. I stayed because I had nowhere else to go. The constant fear of another big quake was exhausting. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. It felt like my world had been shattered.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. Talking about it brings back those feelings of helplessness and fear. But there's also a sense of relief, like I'm finally confronting something I've been avoiding for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I think what affected me most was the aftermath. The campus slowly came back to life, but nothing felt the same. I struggled to focus on my studies, constantly on edge. Every loud noise made me jump. I felt disconnected from my friends who hadn't been there, like they couldn't possibly understand.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part was the nightmares. For months, I'd wake up in a cold sweat, convinced another earthquake was happening. Sometimes, during the day, I'd suddenly feel like the ground was moving. It was like my body couldn't forget the experience, even when my mind wanted to.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Talking about it brings back a lot of those sensations - the fear, the helplessness. But there's also a strange sense of strength. Like, I survived that, and I'm here now, facing it. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally processing it instead of just trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult, but I think it's helping. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. It's like I'm seeing the experience from a different perspective now. I can recognize how resilient I was, even in those moments of fear.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart is racing a bit, and my palms are sweaty. But it's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? Like I'm not carrying this secret burden anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* You're right, that helps. I think I'm starting to understand that while the earthquake was a terrible experience, it doesn't define me. I'm more than just a victim of a natural disaster. I'm a survivor, and I'm working on becoming stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. This process is challenging, but I think it's worth it. I feel like I'm finally facing my fears instead of running from them. It's giving me hope that maybe one day, I won't be so controlled by this memory.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: I think that's a good idea. It's been intense, but in a good way. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe proud of myself? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a natural response.",
