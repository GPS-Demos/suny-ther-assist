    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 5 or 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and begin describing the event.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm at the park near my apartment. It's a sunny day, and I can feel the warmth on my skin. I'm walking along the path, lost in thought about my upcoming exams. The trees are swaying gently in the breeze, and I can hear birds chirping...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear a low growl. My heart starts racing as I turn to see a large dog, teeth bared, staring right at me. Its fur is bristled, and I can see the muscles tensing in its legs. I... I freeze. My mind goes blank, and I can't move...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and my hands are getting clammy. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog lunges at me. I try to back away, but I stumble and fall. I can feel the rough concrete scraping my palms. The dog is on top of me now, its hot breath on my face. I'm... I'm terrified. I can't breathe. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to bring my arm up to protect my face. The dog's teeth sink into my forearm. The pain is... it's intense. Sharp. I can feel its jaw clamping down. I'm yelling now, crying for help. People are shouting in the distance, but it feels like they're so far away...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I see the dog's eyes. They're wild, angry. I hear its growls mixed with my own screams. I feel the weight of its body on my chest, making it hard to breathe. The pain in my arm is throbbing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: Someone's running towards us now. A man with a stick. He's yelling at the dog, trying to get it off me. The dog finally lets go of my arm, but it's still snarling. I'm sobbing, trying to crawl away. My arm is bleeding, and I can see torn flesh...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My whole body is trembling. I feel... helpless. Weak.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man manages to chase the dog away. He's asking if I'm okay, but I can barely speak. I'm just staring at my arm, watching the blood drip onto the pavement. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" I feel so stupid for not being more aware of my surroundings. I should have seen the dog coming. I should have been able to defend myself better...",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around an 8. My heart is racing just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: People are gathering around now. Someone's calling an ambulance. I can hear sirens in the distance. My arm is throbbing, and I'm starting to feel lightheaded. The man who chased the dog away is trying to comfort me, but his words sound muffled...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Embarrassed. Angry. I want to disappear. I don't want all these people staring at me...",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens as the ambulance arrives?",
    "Client: The paramedics are asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. They're examining my arm, and it hurts when they touch it. I'm still shaking. They help me onto a stretcher, and I can see people watching as they load me into the ambulance...",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Exposed. Vulnerable. I hate being the center of attention like this. I just want to wake up and realize it was all a bad dream...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: They're cleaning my wound. It stings, and I wince. The paramedic is trying to distract me, asking about my studies. But all I can think about is how this is going to affect my exams. I'm going to fall behind. I might fail...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7 now. Still high, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happens at the hospital.",
    "Client: We arrive at the ER. It's busy, noisy. I'm wheeled into a room, and a doctor comes to examine me. He's explaining something about stitches and rabies shots, but I'm having trouble focusing. I'm just staring at my torn shirt, covered in blood...",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying the attack in my mind. Wondering what I could have done differently. Feeling angry at the dog's owner for not having it on a leash. Angry at myself for being so helpless...",
    "Therapist: Those thoughts are common after a traumatic event. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're stitching up my arm now. I can feel the needle, but it's numb. I'm watching the doctor work, and it's surreal. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else's arm. They're talking about follow-up appointments and wound care, but it's all a blur...",

    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens when they finish treating you?",
    "Client: They give me some paperwork and prescriptions. A nurse helps me into a wheelchair. My roommate is there to pick me up. I feel a wave of relief seeing a familiar face, but also shame. I don't want him to see me like this...",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you leave the hospital?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried about how this will affect my life. Will I be able to use my arm properly? Will I fall behind in my studies? And... I'm scared. Scared of going back to that park. Scared of dogs now...",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid concerns. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Really tired. But also kind of... I don't know, relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding...",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job today, Jake. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. It's still scary to think about, but maybe a little less so now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Let's end here and discuss some grounding techniques for you to use this week."
