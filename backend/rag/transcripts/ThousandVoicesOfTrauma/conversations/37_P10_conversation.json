    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some difficult memories, and I'm not sure how I'll handle it. Part of me wants to just get it over with, but another part is screaming to run away.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the break room at work. It's lunchtime, and I can smell the microwave popcorn someone just made. I'm sitting alone at the table, scrolling through my phone, trying to look busy.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A group of my coworkers comes in. They're laughing and talking loudly. I can feel their eyes on me, but I pretend not to notice. Then... then Sarah, she's the team lead, she says, \"Oh look, it's our little diversity hire.\" My stomach drops.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? My hands are getting clammy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I want to say something, to stand up for myself, but my throat feels tight. I just keep staring at my phone, willing them to go away. But they don't. Tom chimes in, \"I bet she got in on a quota. No way she's actually qualified.\" I can feel tears pricking at my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I feel so small, like I want to disappear. The fluorescent lights seem too bright, and their voices are so loud. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, this is just a memory. You're here with me, safe in my office. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. God, I hate feeling like this again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the window, and... and the painting on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's go back to the break room. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally look up from my phone. My vision is blurry from unshed tears, but I can see their smirking faces. Sarah's leaning against the counter, arms crossed, looking so smug. I manage to choke out, \"That's... that's not true. I earned my position.\"",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to stand up for yourself?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Empowering. My voice is shaky, but I said something. My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. What do they do?",
    "Client: They laugh. It's this harsh, mocking sound that makes me flinch. Tom says, \"Oh, come on. We're just joking around. Don't be so sensitive.\" But their eyes... they're cold. There's no warmth, no friendship there.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so alone. So out of place. Like no matter what I do, I'll never belong. I've worked so hard to get here, and they're just... they're reducing me to nothing but my race. It's not fair. It's not...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Priya. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. My chair scrapes loudly against the floor. Everyone goes quiet. I can feel their eyes on me, but I don't look at them. I just grab my lunch and walk out. My legs feel weak, like they might give out at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go?",
    "Client: To the bathroom. I lock myself in a stall and just... break down. I'm crying so hard I can barely breathe. My chest hurts, and I feel nauseous. I keep hearing their words, their laughter, over and over in my head.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to quit. To run away and never come back. But I also want to scream, to fight back. I'm so angry, but I feel so powerless. I... I start texting my husband. My fingers are shaking so much I can barely type.",
    "Therapist: What does your husband say?",
    "Client: He... he tells me he loves me. That I'm strong, that I belong there. He offers to come pick me up, but I tell him no. I have to stay. I can't let them win.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Supported. Loved. But also... so tired. So worn down. Why do I always have to be strong? Why can't I just exist without having to prove myself constantly?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings, Priya. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. Talking about my husband helped.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I wash my face. Try to make it look like I haven't been crying. I stare at myself in the mirror for a long time. I look so... defeated. But I take a deep breath, straighten my clothes, and walk back out.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to leave the bathroom?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Like I'm walking into a battlefield. My heart's racing again, and my palms are sweaty. But I hold my head high. I won't let them see how much they've hurt me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. What happens when you get back to your desk?",
    "Client: Sarah's there. She's smiling, but it doesn't reach her eyes. She says, \"Hey, Priya. No hard feelings about earlier, right? We were just kidding around.\" I... I don't know what to say. I feel frozen.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What do you want to say to Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I want to tell her how much she hurt me. How her words were racist and cruel. But I'm afraid. Afraid of making things worse, of being labeled as 'difficult' or 'oversensitive'. So I just... I just nod and say, \"It's fine.\" But it's not fine. It's so far from fine.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to say that?",
    "Client: Like I'm betraying myself. Like I'm swallowing poison. My throat feels tight again, and I can feel a headache coming on. I hate this. I hate feeling so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Priya. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 again. I feel so angry at myself for not speaking up.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath. What happens for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I... I throw myself into my work. I barely look up from my computer. I can hear them whispering, laughing. I don't know if they're talking about me, but it feels like they are. Every time someone walks by my desk, I tense up. By the end of the day, my shoulders are so tight they hurt.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're getting ready to leave?",
    "Client: Relieved. Exhausted. Like I've run a marathon. But also... dreading coming back tomorrow. Wondering if this is what every day is going to be like from now on.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What do you do when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I break down again as soon as I walk through the door. My husband is there, and he just holds me while I cry. I tell him everything, and he listens. He's angry on my behalf, wants to call HR, but I beg him not to. I'm afraid it'll make things worse.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share this with your husband?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief. Like I can finally breathe again. But I also feel ashamed. Like I should have handled it better, been stronger. I hate feeling so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, Priya. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6. Talking about my husband's support helps.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, as we start to wrap up this memory, I want you to think about what you've learned from this experience. What would you tell yourself now, looking back?",
    "Client: I... I would tell myself that it's not my fault. That their behavior says more about them than it does about me. That I deserve to be there, that I've earned my place. And that... that it's okay to speak up, to stand up for myself. That staying silent only protects them, not me.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful realizations, Priya. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... tired. Drained. But also... maybe a little stronger? Like revisiting this memory has taken away some of its power. It still hurts, but... but I can face it now.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Priya. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 5 now. I feel wrung out, but... but okay.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session. You've shown tremendous courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart. It's still hard, but... but I feel like I can handle it now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal of these sessions. You're doing great work, Priya. How do you feel about continuing this process in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready. This was hard, but... but I can see how it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll pick up here next time. For now, make sure to take care of yourself tonight. You've done some heavy emotional lifting today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Priya. I'll see you next week."
