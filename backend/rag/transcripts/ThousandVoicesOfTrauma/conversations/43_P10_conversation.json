    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Ahmadi. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, honestly. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, but another part that's hesitant. It's strange to be discussing cyber bullying at my age, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to the incident?",
    "Client: Alright... (deep breath) I'm sitting at my computer in the study. It's late afternoon, and I've just finished a video call with my grandchildren. I decide to check my social media...",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see on the screen?",
    "Client: I see... oh God, I see a flood of hateful comments on my latest post. It was just a simple picture of my garden, but these people... they're saying such vicious things. Calling me old, irrelevant, a \"boomer\" who should stay off the internet. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My hands are starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start scrolling through the comments. Each one feels like a punch to the gut. There are so many of them, and they're getting more personal. Someone's saying they hope I die soon so I stop \"polluting\" their feed. I can feel my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: Focus on that physical sensation. Where do you feel it in your body?",
    "Client: It's in my chest, like a tight knot. And my throat feels constricted. I... I want to cry, but I'm also angry. How dare they? I've never done anything to these people!",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that maybe they're right. Maybe I am too old for this. I should just delete all my accounts and disappear. But then I feel furious because why should I have to do that? It's not fair!",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (audible breathing) Okay... okay, I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what do you do next in this memory?",
    "Client: I... I call my daughter. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. When she answers, I just start sobbing. I can't even get the words out at first.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What does it feel like to reach out for help?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and shame. I'm glad to hear her voice, but I feel so stupid. I'm a grown woman crying over internet comments. But my daughter, she's so kind. She listens and tells me it's not my fault.",
    "Therapist: How does her support affect you in that moment?",
    "Client: It helps, but I still feel... exposed. Vulnerable. Like I've lost some kind of innocence about the world. I thought I was past the age where bullying could affect me like this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. Talking to my daughter helped, but I still feel shaken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue. What happens after the call?",
    "Client: I sit there for a while, just staring at the screen. I consider deleting my account, but something stops me. I don't want them to win. So instead, I... I start blocking the worst offenders. It feels good, like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How does it feel to take action?",
    "Client: It's empowering, but also sad. Each block reminds me of the cruel things they said. I keep wondering why people can be so mean to strangers.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I start to feel angry at myself. Why did I let this affect me so much? I've lived through wars, through immigration, through so much hardship. Why is this, of all things, breaking me down?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel affected. Cyber bullying can be very impactful. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around a 7 again. I feel a heaviness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I decide to write a post about what happened. My hands are trembling as I type, but I feel like I need to say something. I write about how cyber bullying affects people of all ages, how words can hurt no matter how old you are.",
    "Therapist: That's very brave. How does it feel to share your experience?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. But also... necessary. Like I'm standing up for myself and others who might be going through the same thing.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. What happens after you post it?",
    "Client: I... I close my laptop. I can't bear to look at the responses right away. I go to the kitchen and make myself a cup of tea, trying to calm my nerves. But I keep glancing at my phone, wondering if anyone has responded.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment of anticipation. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm scared. What if they attack me again? What if it gets worse? But there's also a tiny part of me that hopes maybe, just maybe, it might make a difference.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as you're waiting?",
    "Client: It's... it's at an 8. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens when you finally check?",
    "Client: I... I see notifications popping up. My hand is shaking as I unlock the phone. And then... oh my. There are so many supportive comments. People sharing their own stories, thanking me for speaking up. I start crying again, but this time it's from relief.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming in a different way. I feel seen, understood. Like maybe some good can come from this awful experience.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5. I still feel shaken, but also... stronger somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. As we start to wrap up this exercise, what final thoughts or feelings come up for you?",
    "Client: I... I realize that even at my age, I'm still learning and growing. This experience, as painful as it was, taught me something about the modern world and about myself. I feel... I feel like I want to do more to combat cyber bullying, especially for older adults who might feel as lost as I did.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. How are you feeling overall now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but also kind of proud. I faced this memory, and I'm still here. My SUDS is probably around a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mrs. Ahmadi. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (audible breathing) Thank you, doctor. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions."
