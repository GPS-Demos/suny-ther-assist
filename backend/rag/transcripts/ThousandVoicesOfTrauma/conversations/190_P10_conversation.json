    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're focusing on your cult experiences. Close your eyes and describe what you're seeing.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm seeing the compound. It's dusk, and the sky is this eerie orange color. I can smell incense burning... it's sickly sweet. I'm standing outside the main hall, and my stomach is in knots because I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The bell rings... it's time for the \"cleansing ritual.\" God, I hated that sound. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe. I... I don't want to go in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are other members filing in. They all look so... blank. Like robots. I see Sarah, my friend, and she looks scared too. We make eye contact, but we can't speak. It's not allowed.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. My heart is racing. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in my office. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Yes... yes, I can. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... We're inside now. The room is dimly lit with candles, and there's that awful incense again. The leader, he's standing at the front. He's wearing those ridiculous robes, but he looks so... powerful. Everyone's eyes are on him.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He starts talking about purification, about how we're all sinners. His voice is... hypnotic. I feel myself getting pulled in, even though part of me is screaming to run.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that maybe he's right. Maybe I am dirty, maybe I do need to be cleansed. But then I remember what the \"cleansing\" really means, and I feel sick again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 75.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader, he's calling people up one by one. I'm praying he doesn't pick me, but I know he will. He always does. And then... and then he says my name. \"Sarah, come forward. It's time for your cleansing.\"",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel when he calls your name?",
    "Client: It's like ice water in my veins. My legs feel weak, but I know I have to go up there. I... I stand up, and it feels like everyone's eyes are boring into me. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I walk to the front, and he puts his hand on my shoulder. It feels so heavy, like it's pinning me in place. He starts talking about my sins, about how I need to be purified. And then... (voice breaks) and then he starts hitting me. He calls it \"driving out the evil,\" but it's just... it's just abuse.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Sarah. Remember, you're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: (breathing shakily) It hurts so much. Every blow feels like it's breaking me apart. I want to scream, but I can't. We're not allowed to make noise during the cleansing. I... I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Feel the chair beneath you, listen to my voice. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The... the beating goes on for what feels like hours. My whole body is on fire. When he finally stops, I can barely stand. He makes me thank him for the cleansing, for making me pure again. The words taste like ash in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Broken. Humiliated. But also... angry. So, so angry. I hate him, I hate all of them for watching, for not stopping it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: I stumble back to my seat. Everyone's avoiding my eyes now. I can feel myself shaking, and I'm biting my lip so hard to keep from crying out. The rest of the ritual is a blur. All I can focus on is the pain, and this tiny voice in my head that's screaming, \"This isn't right. This isn't love.\"",
    "Therapist: That voice is important. How does hearing it make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. But also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a part of me that hasn't been completely brainwashed.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. Talking about that little voice of doubt... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The ritual ends, and we're all dismissed. I can barely walk, but no one offers to help me. That's part of it too - we're supposed to bear our \"cleansing\" alone. I make it back to my bunk, and I just... collapse.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel lying there?",
    "Client: Empty. Drained. But there's this... this tiny spark of rebellion growing. I start thinking about how I could escape, even though I'm terrified of what might happen if I try.",
    "Therapist: That spark is your strength. Hold onto that feeling.",
    "Client: I... I curl up on my bunk, every part of me aching. And I make a promise to myself. I promise that someday, somehow, I'm going to get out. I'm going to be free.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment, Sarah. How does it feel to remember making that promise?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm proud of that part of me that fought back, but I'm also sad for the girl who had to go through all that.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55. I feel... drained, but also a little stronger.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Sarah. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
