    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky. My hands are trembling a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? Watching that news footage of the police brutality incident. I can still hear the sirens, see the flashing lights. It's bringing up a lot of... anxiety, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all is. How helpless I feel. It's like... it's like being a kid again, you know? Watching adults do terrible things and not being able to do anything about it. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. And there's this voice in my head saying, \"This could happen to you. You're not safe.\"",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that feeling of helplessness compare to your past experiences?",
    "Client: God, it's so similar. When I was young, my parents... they were always busy, always working. I'd be left alone for hours, sometimes days. I'd watch the news, see all these terrible things happening in the world, and feel so small, so powerless. This feels just like that. Like I'm that scared little boy again, wanting someone to protect me, but no one's there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What do you notice in your body as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight, like I'm trying not to cry. My shoulders are tense, hunched up near my ears. I feel... exposed, I guess. Vulnerable. Like at any moment, something bad could happen, and I wouldn't be able to stop it. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel safe. I know logically that I'm okay here, but emotionally, I feel like I'm in danger. I keep looking at the door, half-expecting someone to burst in. It's exhausting, always being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: How does this state of alertness affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's constant, you know? I'm always scanning my environment, always ready for something to go wrong. At work, I struggle to focus because I'm so hyper-aware of everything around me. In my personal life, it's hard to relax, to let my guard down. I've pushed away so many people because I can't seem to shake this feeling of impending doom. It's... it's lonely.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really isolating. How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. Work long hours, exercise a lot. Anything to keep my mind occupied. But it's not really helping, you know? It's just... postponing the inevitable crash. Sometimes I'll have a panic attack, and it feels like all those suppressed emotions are hitting me at once. It's like... like I'm drowning in my own fear and anger.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to feel safe?",
    "Client: God, that's... that's a big question. I guess... feeling safe would mean not always being on high alert. It would mean being able to trust people, to form connections without constantly worrying about being hurt or abandoned. It would mean... being able to live in the present, instead of always bracing for the next disaster. But I don't know if I'll ever get there. It feels so far away.",
    "Therapist: How does that distance make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry. Sad. It's like... I can see this version of myself that's happy and calm, but it's on the other side of this massive chasm. And no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to bridge that gap. It makes me wonder if I'm broken somehow, if I'll always be stuck in this cycle of fear and hypervigilance.",
    "Therapist: What would it take to start building that bridge?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe learning to trust myself first? To believe that I can handle whatever comes my way? It's just... it's scary to let my guard down, even a little. But I'm tired of living like this, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I want to feel... I don't know, normal? At peace? Is that even possible for someone like me?",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"someone like me\"?",
    "Client: Someone who's... damaged, I guess. Someone who's been let down so many times that trusting feels like setting myself up for more pain. Someone who's seen the worst of humanity and can't unsee it. I feel like I'm carrying this heavy weight of experiences, and I don't know how to put it down.",
    "Therapist: How does carrying that weight impact your view of the future?",
    "Client: It... it makes the future feel bleak, to be honest. Like no matter what I do, I'll always be trapped in this cycle of fear and anxiety. But then... then I think about moments like this, in therapy, where I'm actually talking about these things. And there's a tiny part of me that feels... hopeful? Like maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live differently. It's a small spark, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That spark sounds important. What does it mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means that maybe I'm not completely broken. That there's still a part of me that wants to heal, to grow. It's like... like a tiny flame in a dark room. Sometimes I can barely see it, but it's there, refusing to go out. And when I focus on it, I can almost imagine a future where I'm not constantly afraid. Where I can trust, and connect, and feel... whole.",
    "Therapist: How can we nurture that spark moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to acknowledge it more. To remind myself that it's there, even on the bad days. Maybe... maybe I could start small? Like, try to notice moments when I feel even a little bit safe, and really let myself experience that feeling. And... and maybe I could try opening up to someone outside of therapy. Just a little. Baby steps, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about these ideas?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic, I guess? It's scary to think about changing, about letting go of these defense mechanisms I've relied on for so long. But at the same time, there's a part of me that's excited. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to build a life that isn't dominated by fear and anxiety. It's a small step, but it feels... significant.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, somehow. Like talking about this has lifted some of the weight off my shoulders. There's still anxiety there, still fear, but it doesn't feel quite as overwhelming. It's like... like I can see a path forward now, even if it's just a faint outline. And that... that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to sit with this feeling for a moment. This mix of hope and possibility. It's not something I experience often, and I want to really let it sink in. Maybe... maybe we could do a quick grounding exercise? Something to help me carry this feeling with me when I leave?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah... yeah, that feels good. It's like... it's like I can breathe a little easier now. Like the world isn't quite as scary as it was when I walked in here. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week."
