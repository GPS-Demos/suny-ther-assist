    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the cyberbullying incident, and it still makes me feel uneasy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... ever since I lost my brother last year, everything feels more intense. The cyberbullying brought up so many emotions I thought I had dealt with.",
    "Therapist: I see. Let's start slowly. Can you tell me about that day?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about three months ago. I was scrolling through my social media feed when I saw a comment on one of my posts. At first, I thought it was just a random troll, but then I realized it was someone I knew from my community. They... they said some really hurtful things about my business and my family.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: They accused me of being a fraud, saying my self-employed status was just a cover for being unemployed. But the worst part was when they brought up my brother. They said... they said I was using his death for attention and sympathy purchases. I felt like I couldn't breathe when I read that.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I just... I couldn't believe someone could be so cruel. My hands were shaking, and I felt this overwhelming urge to defend myself. But at the same time, I felt paralyzed. It was like losing my brother all over again, you know? That same feeling of helplessness and grief just washed over me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I remember closing the app and just sitting there, staring at my phone. My husband came in and asked what was wrong, but I couldn't even speak. I just handed him the phone. When he saw it, he got so angry. He wanted to confront the person, but I begged him not to. I was afraid it would make things worse.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt... exposed. Vulnerable. Like my grief was being used against me. It brought back all the pain of losing my brother, but now it was mixed with this new hurt and betrayal. I started questioning everything - my business, my choices, even how I had been grieving. It was like a flood of self-doubt.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. I couldn't focus on work, I was constantly checking my phone, afraid of more comments. I felt like I was drowning in anxiety. Every notification made my heart race. I started withdrawing from social media, which affected my business. I felt like I was losing control of everything I had worked so hard for.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I couldn't talk to anyone about it. My husband was supportive, but he was so angry about the situation that I felt like I had to be strong for him. And I didn't want to burden my parents - they're still dealing with my brother's loss too. I felt so alone, even though I was surrounded by people who love me.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. Continue.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares. Not just about the cyberbullying, but about my brother too. In my dreams, he would be disappointed in me for not standing up for myself, for not honoring his memory properly. I'd wake up in cold sweats, feeling guilty and ashamed. It was like the cyberbullying had reopened all the wounds from his death.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. But talking about it, really going through the details... it's like I can see it more clearly now. I realize that person's words were more about their own issues than about me or my brother. It still hurts, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to start rebuilding. Maybe I can use this experience to help others who've been through similar situations. My brother always said I had a talent for connecting with people. Maybe this is a way I can honor his memory and help myself heal at the same time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like something good can come from all this pain. I'm still scared, and I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in months, I feel like I have a direction. Like I'm not just a victim anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I couldn't have done this without your support. I know we still have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I've taken a big step today. Is it okay if we end here for now? I feel drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made excellent progress. We'll continue next session."
