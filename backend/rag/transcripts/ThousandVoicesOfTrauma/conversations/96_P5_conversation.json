    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Johnson. I'm... okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. My arthritis is acting up, and I didn't sleep well last night. The memories... they keep coming back.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. But I'm not sure what that means exactly. Is it going to be difficult? I've been through so much already with losing Maria and then that terrible accident...",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your healing. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into. At my age, I don't like surprises anymore.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. It helps process the event.",
    "Client: Revisit the accident? Dios m\u00edo, that sounds terrifying. I've been trying so hard to forget it all. Why would we want to bring it back?",
    "Therapist: I know it seems counterintuitive. But facing the memory can reduce its power over you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's... scary. But I trust you, doctora. You've helped me so much already. Can you tell me more about what will happen?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory in detail. I'll guide you through it. We'll go at your pace. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but I want to get better. For my grandchildren, you know? They worry about me. Will it hurt to remember?",
    "Therapist: It may be emotionally difficult, but you're safe here. We can pause anytime. Your bravery is admirable.",
    "Client: Gracias. I... I want to be strong. Like Maria would have wanted. Can I hold onto her photo while we do this?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Whatever helps you feel secure. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: Just one. Will this really help me sleep better? The nightmares... they're exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Many find it helps reduce nightmares and improves sleep. Your experiences may vary, but it's a positive step.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready to try. For Maria, for my family, and for myself. Let's do this, doctora.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is inspiring, Mr. Rodriguez. We'll start gently. Remember, you're in control throughout this process.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel a little better knowing that. It's still scary, but I'm ready to face this ghost from my past. Let's begin."
