    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories... they felt so real, like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Both during the abuse and now, reliving it. It's like... I'm frozen in time, unable to move or speak. I know logically that I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. How are you coping with those sensations?",
    "Client: I'm trying to focus on my breathing, like we practiced. In... and out. But it's hard. My mind keeps wandering back to those dark places. I feel... ashamed. Like somehow, it was my fault. I know that's not true, but the feeling is so strong.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have those thoughts. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel angry. Not just at the person who hurt me, but at myself for not being able to move past this. It's been years, and yet here I am, still struggling. I wonder if I'll ever truly feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: Normal can mean different things. What would \"normal\" look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I guess normal would be not feeling scared all the time. Being able to trust people, especially in romantic relationships. Not flinching at unexpected touches or sounds. Just... being able to live without this constant weight on my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable desires. How do you feel you've progressed towards those goals?",
    "Client: Sometimes I feel like I've made progress. There are days when I feel stronger, more in control. But then something triggers me, and I feel like I'm back at square one. It's frustrating and exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Healing isn't always linear. What helps you during those difficult moments?",
    "Client: Umm... I try to remind myself that I'm safe now. I use grounding techniques, like focusing on objects around me or counting backwards. Sometimes I call a friend or my partner. But it's hard to reach out; I worry about being a burden.",
    "Therapist: It's brave of you to reach out. How does your partner respond when you do?",
    "Client: They're... they're actually really supportive. Patient, even when I push them away. Sometimes that makes me feel guilty, like I don't deserve their kindness. But they always reassure me that they're there for me, no matter what.",
    "Therapist: That support sounds valuable. How does it impact your healing process?",
    "Client: It helps, definitely. Knowing I have someone in my corner... it makes the bad days a little more bearable. But sometimes I worry that I'm too dependent on them. I want to be strong on my own, you know?",
    "Therapist: Independence and support can coexist. How might you balance the two?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by setting small goals for myself? Things I can accomplish on my own, while still allowing myself to lean on others when I need to. It's just... it's hard to find that balance.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful approach. What small goal might you set for this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe... maybe I could try going to the grocery store by myself. It's something I've been avoiding, but I know it's important for my independence. Just thinking about it makes me anxious, though.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel anxious. How might you prepare for that challenge?",
    "Client: I could... I could make a list beforehand, so I know exactly what I need. And maybe practice some breathing exercises before I go. Oh, and I could let my partner know what I'm doing, so they can be ready if I need to call them.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent strategies. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... a little excited? Like, maybe this could be a small step towards reclaiming my life. It's scary, but I want to try. I want to prove to myself that I can do it.",
    "Therapist: That determination is admirable. What else might help you feel prepared?",
    "Client: I think... maybe reviewing some of the coping techniques we've discussed? And reminding myself that it's okay if things don't go perfectly. It's about the attempt, right? About pushing my boundaries, even if it's just a little bit.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How does this goal align with your broader recovery journey?",
    "Client: It feels like... like I'm taking back control. In a small way, sure, but it's something. And maybe if I can do this, I can gradually work up to bigger challenges. It's like... planting a seed of hope, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful metaphor. How does it feel to recognize that hope?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of amazing. For so long, I've felt stuck in this dark place. But talking about this, setting this goal... it's like I can see a tiny glimmer of light. It's faint, but it's there. And maybe, just maybe, it'll grow brighter with time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk more about building on this. Maybe explore other small steps I can take, or ways to nurture that seed of hope. And... maybe we could discuss how to handle setbacks without losing sight of the progress I've made?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent topics. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, reliving these memories, but I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward. It's terrifying and exciting all at once. I'm grateful to have this space to work through it all.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. We'll continue this journey together next week."
