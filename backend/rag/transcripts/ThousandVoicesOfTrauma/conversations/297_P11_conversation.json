    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going back to that day in the field hospital, it's like I was right there again. The sounds, the smells... it's so vivid. I can still hear the helicopters and the screams of the wounded soldiers. It's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The chaos. Everything was happening so fast. I remember trying to triage patients, but there were just so many. I kept thinking, \"Am I making the right decisions? Will this person live because of me, or die because I chose wrong?\" It's... it's suffocating to think about.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I felt sweaty, and my hands were shaking. It's like... like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the blood and antiseptic. I felt this tightness in my chest, like I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you managing those feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting a little better. I'm trying to use those breathing exercises we practiced. It helps a bit. But I still feel on edge, like something bad might happen at any moment. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common response. How does this compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: I think... I think it was actually a bit easier this time. Don't get me wrong, it was still awful. But I felt like I could stay with the memory a little longer without completely falling apart. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think contributed to that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe it's because we've been working on this for a while now? I feel like I understand my reactions better. And knowing you're here, guiding me through it... it helps. I don't feel so alone in facing this anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. How does this relate to your everyday symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that my anxiety spikes aren't as frequent now. I still get them, especially when I hear loud noises or see something that reminds me of that day. But they don't last as long. And sometimes, I can talk myself down using the techniques we've practiced.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What's been most helpful in managing those moments?",
    "Client: The grounding techniques, definitely. Focusing on my senses, reminding myself where I am now. And... and I've been more open with my husband about what I'm going through. He's been really supportive, which helps a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How has this process affected your view of the trauma?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. I still feel guilty sometimes, wondering if I could have done more. But I'm starting to understand that I did the best I could in an impossible situation. It doesn't erase what happened, but... I guess I'm learning to be a little kinder to myself?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I thought. Facing these memories is terrifying, but I'm doing it. And each time, it gets a tiny bit easier. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. But here I am, doing just that. It's... it's actually kind of empowering.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I want to keep going. I can see the progress, even if it's slow. And I want to get to a place where these memories don't control my life anymore. It's hard work, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. For believing I could do it when I didn't believe in myself. It means a lot. And... and I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows your readiness to heal. Shall we schedule our next meeting?",
    "Client: Yes, please. Same time next week? I... I think I'm ready to tackle the next part of this memory. It's scary, but... I think I can do it.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll see you then. Take care, and remember to use your coping strategies."
