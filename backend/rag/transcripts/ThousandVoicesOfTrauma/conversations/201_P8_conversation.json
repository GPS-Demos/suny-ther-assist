    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating, but not in a good way. My heart is still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to catch my breath sometimes. The memories... they felt so vivid, so real. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. Part of me is relieved that it's over, that I'm here in this room and not... there. But another part of me is angry. Angry that I still have to deal with this, that it still affects me so much after all these years. And then there's this voice in my head telling me I should be over it by now, that I'm weak for still struggling with this. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my stomach. Hot and intense. I'm angry at him, of course, for what he did. But I'm also angry at myself for not fighting back harder, for not telling anyone sooner. And I'm angry at the world, I guess. Why did this have to happen to me? And then, on top of all that, I'm angry that I still have to deal with the aftermath of his actions. It's not fair. I didn't ask for any of this.",
    "Therapist: How does this anger relate to your experiences of racial trauma?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's all tangled up together, you know? The sexual abuse and the racial trauma. Both experiences made me feel powerless, like I didn't have control over my own body or my own life. And in both cases, I felt like I couldn't speak up, couldn't tell anyone what was happening. With the racial stuff, it was like... like I was expected to just take it, to not make waves. And with the abuse, I was too scared and ashamed to say anything. So the anger... it's for all of it. For every time I've been made to feel less than, whether because of my race or because of what he did to me.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are clenched. I didn't even realize until you asked. And my jaw is tight. I can feel a headache coming on, starting at the base of my skull and creeping up. My breathing is still shallow, and there's this weight on my chest. It's like... like I'm carrying around a heavy stone right here (gestures to her heart). And I'm cold. I don't know why, but I'm suddenly really cold.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up under a blanket and hide from the world. But another part of me feels restless, like I need to move, to do something. I guess... I guess what I really need is to feel safe. To know that I'm okay, that I'm not back there anymore. And maybe... maybe to feel like I'm not alone in this. It's so isolating sometimes, dealing with all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. I'm here with you. How can we help you feel safer right now?",
    "Client: I... maybe we could do one of those grounding exercises? The one where we name things we can see and touch? And... and maybe you could remind me that I'm here, in this room, that I'm safe now. I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I need to hear it from someone else to really believe it.",
    "Therapist: Not silly at all. Let's do that. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Okay, um... I see the green plant in the corner. The blue painting on the wall. The soft, gray carpet. The wooden desk. And... and your kind face. (takes a deep breath) That... that helps. It reminds me where I am.",
    "Therapist: Good. And how do you feel now?",
    "Client: A little calmer. My breathing is slower. The tightness in my chest is easing up a bit. I still feel... raw, I guess. Like I've been scrubbed with sandpaper. But I'm more... present. More here.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm proud of myself, actually. For getting through that exposure. It was hard, really hard. But I did it. And maybe... maybe that means I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Maybe it means I can get through this, all of it. The abuse, the racial trauma, all of it. It won't be easy, but... but maybe I can do it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge your strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Good, but strange. I'm not used to thinking of myself as strong. For so long, I've felt weak, helpless. But you're right, getting through that exposure took strength. And surviving everything I've been through... that takes strength too, doesn't it? It's like... like I'm seeing myself in a new light. It's scary, but also... kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: Exciting how?",
    "Client: Well, if I'm strong enough to face these memories, to talk about them... maybe I'm strong enough to make other changes in my life too. Maybe I can stand up for myself more, set better boundaries. Maybe I can start to heal not just from the abuse, but from the racial trauma too. It's like... like a door is opening, and I can see possibilities I couldn't see before.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How will you carry this strength forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll try to remind myself of this feeling when things get tough. When I start to doubt myself or feel overwhelmed. I'll remember that I got through this session, that I faced these memories head-on. And maybe... maybe I'll try to be a little kinder to myself. To acknowledge my progress instead of always focusing on what I still need to work on. It's not going to be easy, but... but I think it's worth trying.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you want to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For being here with me through this. For helping me see my own strength. I know we still have a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel... hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of your progress today. How are you feeling as we end?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter. Still a bit shaky, but in a good way. Like I've shed something heavy. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired. Like I've done something important. And I'm... I'm looking forward to our next session. To continuing this work. It's hard, but it feels worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Take care, and I'll see you next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next time."
