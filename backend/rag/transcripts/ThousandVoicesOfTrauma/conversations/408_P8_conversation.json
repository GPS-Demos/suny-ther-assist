    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. The memory of losing my sister to domestic violence... it's just so vivid. I can still hear her voice, you know? The last time we spoke on the phone, she sounded so scared. I should've done something more.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Intense guilt. And anger. I'm angry at her partner for what he did, angry at myself for not intervening sooner. I keep replaying that last phone call in my head, wondering if I could've said something different, something that would've made her leave him. My chest feels tight, and there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's different now. Back then, I was in shock. I couldn't process anything. Now, it's like I'm feeling everything at once. The pain is sharper, more defined. I'm more aware of how her loss has affected every aspect of my life. I've been using drugs to numb these feelings, but now... now they're all flooding back.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all is. My sister was only 25. She had her whole life ahead of her. I'm angry at the system that failed to protect her, angry at society for normalizing abuse. And I'm scared... scared that I might end up in a similar situation. It's why I've been hesitant about my current relationship. I don't trust my judgment anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does this fear impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's crippling sometimes. I've pushed away friends, quit my job. I'm constantly on edge, watching for signs of aggression in everyone around me. Living with roommates is hard because I'm always worried about their intentions. I've been using more often to cope with the anxiety. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of fear and substance use, and I don't know how to break free.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel safe. To believe that what happened to my sister won't happen to me. I need to learn how to trust again - both myself and others. And I need to find a way to honor my sister's memory without letting it consume me. I want to be able to remember her without this overwhelming pain and guilt.",
    "Therapist: How might you start to move towards that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by talking about her more? Sharing happy memories instead of just focusing on how she died. And perhaps... perhaps I need to be more open with my current partner about my fears. I've been pushing him away, but maybe letting him in could help. And I know I need to address my substance use. It's not what my sister would've wanted for me.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I could start by looking at some old photos of my sister. Maybe choose one happy memory to share with my partner. And... and maybe I could research some support groups for family members of domestic violence victims. I've been avoiding that, but... but maybe it could help. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about those ideas?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's fear, definitely. Opening up about this feels vulnerable. But there's also a tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to heal. It's overwhelming, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might be able to move forward. It's not going to be easy, but... but I think I owe it to myself and to my sister's memory to try.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take these steps?",
    "Client: I... I think I need someone to hold me accountable. Maybe we could check in next session about whether I looked at those photos or talked to my partner? And... and I might need help finding those support groups. The idea of searching for them on my own is a bit daunting. Also, I think I need to address my substance use. It's been my crutch for so long, I'm not sure how to cope without it.",
    "Therapist: How can we work on that together?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe we could explore some healthier coping mechanisms? Things I can do when the urge to use hits. And... and maybe we could look into some substance abuse support programs? I know I can't keep using as a way to numb the pain. It's not fair to my sister's memory, and it's not fair to myself. It's scary to think about facing all these emotions without that buffer, but... but I think it's necessary if I want to truly heal.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope for this journey?",
    "Client: I... I think it's the idea that I could honor my sister's memory by living fully. She always wanted the best for me. And... and maybe by healing, by speaking out about domestic violence, I could help prevent what happened to her from happening to someone else. It's a small hope, but it's there. And the fact that I'm here, talking about this... that gives me hope too. A few months ago, I couldn't even say her name without breaking down. So maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I think I am.",
    "Therapist: How can you remind yourself of that strength?",
    "Client: I... I could start journaling, maybe? Write down moments when I feel strong, or times when I manage to cope without using substances. And... and maybe I could start volunteering at a women's shelter. It would be hard, but it might help me feel like I'm making a difference. Like I'm turning this pain into something meaningful. And it would be a way to stay connected to my sister, to keep her spirit alive in a positive way.",
    "Therapist: What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm realizing that healing isn't linear. There will be good days and bad days, but that's okay. I'm starting to see that facing these memories, as painful as they are, is necessary for moving forward. And... and I'm beginning to understand that my sister's death doesn't define me. It's a part of my story, but it's not the whole story. I have the power to shape what comes next. It's terrifying, but also... also a little empowering.",
    "Therapist: How do you want to close our session today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to take a moment of silence for my sister. To honor her memory, but also to acknowledge the step I've taken today in facing this trauma. And then... then maybe we could end with setting a specific goal for the week? Something small but meaningful. It feels important to leave here with a sense of purpose, you know? Like I'm not just reliving the pain, but actively working towards healing.",
