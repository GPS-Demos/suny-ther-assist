    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? Watching my daughter's social media accounts blow up with all those horrible messages. I can still see her face when she showed me her phone, all pale and trembling. It's... it's not easy to revisit.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now as you reflect on that memory?",
    "Client: Well, there's this tightness in my chest, like someone's squeezing my heart. And I feel... I feel so helpless. I keep thinking, \"I should have protected her better. I should have known what was happening.\" It's... it's overwhelming, really. I'm her father, for God's sake. I should have been able to do something.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I suppose. Back then, it was like a tsunami of emotions. Now it's more like... like a steady, relentless tide. Still painful, but... I can breathe through it, if that makes sense. But there's this underlying anger that just won't go away. These faceless bullies, hiding behind screens, tormenting my little girl... It makes my blood boil.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are clenched. I didn't even realize until you asked. And my jaw feels tight. I guess I'm still holding onto a lot of tension. It's like my body's gearing up for a fight that never comes. Because how do you fight something you can't see or touch?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your overall experience with trauma?",
    "Client: I... I think it's all tied up with feeling powerless. When my wife passed, it was the same feeling. Like the world was spinning out of control and I couldn't do a damn thing about it. With Sarah's cyberbullying, it's... it's like that helplessness came rushing back. I'm supposed to be the protector, the fixer, but... but I couldn't fix this. I couldn't shield her from it.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if I'll ever feel truly at peace again. If Sarah will. It's like this dark cloud that follows us around. Some days are better than others, but... but it's always there, you know? And I keep thinking about all the other kids out there going through the same thing. It's... it's heartbreaking. How did we let the internet become such a cruel place?",
    "Therapist: How has your perspective on this event changed over time?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see it as part of our story now, not the whole story. At first, it felt like this was all there was - this pain, this anger. But now... now I can see moments of light too. The way Sarah's true friends rallied around her. The strength she's shown in healing. It's... it's still hard, but I'm learning to see the resilience in both of us.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've... I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. And more vulnerable too, if that makes sense. I always saw myself as this tough old guy who could handle anything. But this... this broke me open in ways I never expected. And in that breaking, I found a softness I didn't know I had. A capacity to really feel, to empathize. It's... it's changed how I connect with Sarah, with everyone really.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet, I suppose. There's a sadness there, for the man I was before all this happened. But there's also a kind of... I don't know, a tenderness towards myself? Like maybe it's okay that I'm not invincible. That I'm just a dad doing his best in a world that can be pretty damn cruel sometimes. It's... it's humbling. And maybe, in a strange way, it's brought me closer to Sarah. We're both just trying to figure this out, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to breathe. Just... just sit with all of this for a minute. It's a lot, you know? Reliving it all. But also... also I need to remind myself that we're okay. Sarah's okay. We made it through the worst of it. Maybe... maybe I need to give myself permission to feel proud of that. Of us. For not letting those faceless bullies win. For finding a way forward, even when it felt impossible.",
    "Therapist: How can you take care of yourself after today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll call Sarah when I get home. Just to hear her voice, you know? And maybe I'll take a walk in the park near our house. There's something about being in nature that... that helps ground me. Reminds me that the world is bigger than our troubles. And... and I'll try to be gentle with myself. To remember that healing isn't linear, that it's okay to have tough days. That's... that's something you've taught me, doc. And I'm grateful for it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained, to be honest. But also... also a bit lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. It's... it's strange how talking about the hard stuff can leave you feeling both exhausted and relieved. I guess that's part of the process, huh? It's not easy, but... but I think it's worth it. For Sarah. For me. For the relationship we're rebuilding.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll end here.",
    "Client: Thank you, doc. Really. I know I don't always make it easy, but... but I appreciate you sticking with us through this. It means more than you know. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, see you then. Take care."
