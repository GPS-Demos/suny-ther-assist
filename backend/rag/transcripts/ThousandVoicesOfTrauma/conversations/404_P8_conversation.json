    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sounds of the explosions, the smell of smoke... it's all so vivid. I can feel the heat on my skin, even though I know I'm here in this room.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. I keep seeing their faces, the people we couldn't save. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight in my chest. I was a medic, you know? I was supposed to save lives, but sometimes there was just nothing I could do. I remember this one soldier, he couldn't have been more than 20. His legs were... gone. And he kept asking for his mom. I held his hand as he... as he died. I should have done more. I should have saved him.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall this memory?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are so tight they're almost up to my ears. My stomach is in knots. I feel like I can't catch my breath properly. It's like my body is preparing for another attack, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did I survive?\" And then I feel terrible for even thinking that because I know so many others didn't make it. I'm thinking about how unfair war is, how senseless. And I'm angry. Angry at the leaders who put us there, angry at myself for not being able to do more.",
    "Therapist: How does this anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. My fists are clenched, and I notice I'm gritting my teeth. But it's not just anger. There's sadness too. A deep, aching sadness that feels like it's hollowing me out from the inside.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, to forget it all. But another part knows I need to face this. I guess... I need to know it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not weak for struggling with this.",
    "Therapist: It's absolutely okay to feel this way. Your reactions are normal given what you've experienced.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. Sometimes I feel so alone in this, like no one could possibly understand. But talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm letting go of a little bit of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share these experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's relief, definitely. Like I'm finally letting out a breath I've been holding for years. But there's also fear. Fear that if I let it all out, I won't be able to stuff it back in. That I'll fall apart completely. And yet, there's also a tiny spark of hope. Hope that maybe, just maybe, by facing this, I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: What does that spark of hope feel like?",
    "Client: It's small, but warm. Like a candle flame in a dark room. It's in my chest, right next to all the pain and guilt. And when I focus on it, I can breathe a little easier. It makes me think that maybe, someday, I can make peace with what happened. That I can honor those we lost by living my life fully.",
    "Therapist: How does this hope connect to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I guess... it's like a lifeline. On my worst days, when the memories are overwhelming and I feel like I'm drowning in guilt and fear, that little spark of hope keeps me going. It reminds me why I'm doing this therapy, why I'm putting myself through the pain of reliving these memories. Because I want to live, really live, not just survive. I want to find a way to carry these experiences without being crushed by them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. My body feels a bit more relaxed, even though I'm tired. And that spark of hope... it feels a little stronger now. It's like, by talking about this, I'm reclaiming some of the power these memories have had over me.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to feel all of these emotions. That they're part of my experience, but they don't define me. And I want to hold onto that spark of hope. To remind myself that healing is possible, even if it's a long and difficult journey. Maybe I can start to forgive myself, little by little, for the things I couldn't change.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful intention. How will you care for yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe I'll call my sister. I've been avoiding talking to family, but... I think I'm ready to start reconnecting. Oh, and I'll definitely do those breathing exercises you taught me. They really help when the memories start to feel overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent self-care strategies. We're nearing the end of our session. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's scary, but... I'm ready to keep working on it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage today. I look forward to continuing our work together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm nervous about our next session, but I'm also looking forward to it. This feels like an important step, you know? Like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in the past.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. We'll explore that more next time. Take care.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week."
