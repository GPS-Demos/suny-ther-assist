    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the medical trauma you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about two years ago. I was diagnosed with a severe autoimmune disorder. I remember lying in the hospital bed, feeling so weak and scared. The doctors were talking about potential organ failure, and I couldn't stop thinking about dying. The pain was excruciating, and I felt so alone, even though my family was there. I kept thinking about my unfinished degree, my dreams... everything seemed to be slipping away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the uncertainty. Every day brought new test results, new medications, new side effects. I lost so much weight, my hair was falling out, and I barely recognized myself in the mirror. I remember one night, the pain was so bad that I couldn't sleep. I lay there, listening to the beeping machines, wondering if I'd ever feel normal again. I felt like my body had betrayed me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It's hard to go back there... I felt so helpless. The doctors were discussing treatment options, but it all sounded like a foreign language to me. I was terrified of making the wrong decision. What if I chose a treatment that made things worse? I couldn't bear the thought of putting my family through more pain. I remember my husband's face - he tried to look strong, but I could see the fear in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The treatments were brutal. I had to relearn how to do simple tasks like walking and eating. It was humiliating to need help with everything. I felt like I had lost my independence, my identity. There were days when I wanted to give up, to stop fighting. The pain and exhaustion were overwhelming. I missed my studies, my friends, my normal life. Everything revolved around hospital visits and medication schedules.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) The turning point came slowly. I started to see small improvements, but I was afraid to hope. What if it was temporary? What if I relapsed? Every twinge of pain sent me into a panic. I struggled with depression and anxiety, feeling like a burden to everyone around me. The trauma didn't end when I left the hospital - it followed me home, haunting my dreams and my waking hours.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. Talking about it brings back a lot of those feelings - the fear, the helplessness. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I got through it? It's still hard to believe sometimes that I'm here, that I survived. I'm grateful, but there's also anger and sadness for what I lost, for the time that was taken from me.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I think what scares me most now is the possibility of it happening again. Every time I feel unwell, I worry that it's coming back. I'm trying to rebuild my life, to focus on my studies and my future, but sometimes the fear just overwhelms me. I want to move forward, but part of me feels stuck in that hospital room.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those fears. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's just... it changed everything. My relationships, my outlook on life, even my career goals. I'm more cautious now, more aware of my own mortality. Sometimes I feel like I'm living on borrowed time. But I'm also more appreciative of the small things - a good day, a meal with family, the ability to study and learn. It's a constant balance between gratitude and fear.",
    "Therapist: You've gained important insights. How do you feel about ending here today?",
    "Client: I think that's a good idea. It's been intense, but also... I don't know, maybe cathartic? I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy to revisit these memories, but I hope it's helping me process everything.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
