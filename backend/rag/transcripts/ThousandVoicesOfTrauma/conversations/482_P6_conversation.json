    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Johnson. I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about today's session, if I'm honest. My arthritis is acting up, which doesn't help.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember your SUDS scale?",
    "Client: Yes, zero to hundred. I remember.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes and recall the earthquake. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) I... I see the ground shaking. The walls are trembling, and there's this deafening rumble. I'm frozen, can't move. My heart's racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The bookshelf is swaying. Books are falling. I hear screams from outside. I'm trying to get to the doorway, but my legs won't move. I'm so scared...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS now?",
    "Client: 75... maybe 80. My palms are sweating. I feel dizzy, like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) The floor's cracking. I see my neighbors running outside. I should join them, but I can't. I'm paralyzed with fear. The shaking won't stop...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) The power goes out. It's dark. I hear glass shattering. I'm crying, praying it will stop. I think I'm going to die...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still 90. I feel nauseous. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking starts to slow. I hear sirens. People are shouting for help. I'm alive, but... but everything's destroyed. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 70? I feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: Dust everywhere. Broken furniture. The door's jammed. I'm trapped, but alive. I feel... relieved, but guilty.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Down to 50. I'm feeling calmer, but my body's still tense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellently. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. But... lighter? Like I've let something go. My SUDS is about 30 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end here. Open your eyes when ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, takes deep breath) That was intense, but... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... proud? I didn't think I could do that.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll continue next session. Take care."
