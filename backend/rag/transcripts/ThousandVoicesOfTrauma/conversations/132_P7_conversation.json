    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the event?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work late one night. The streets were quiet, almost too quiet. I remember feeling uneasy, like something wasn't right. Then I heard footsteps behind me, getting closer. I turned around and saw two police officers approaching me rapidly. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: They demanded to see my ID. I was confused and scared, but I reached for my purse. Suddenly, one of them grabbed my arm roughly. I tried to explain that I was just getting my ID, but they wouldn't listen. They pushed me against a wall, accusing me of resisting. I felt so helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I kept saying I hadn't done anything wrong, but they ignored me. One officer twisted my arm behind my back, and I cried out in pain. I couldn't understand why this was happening. All I could think about was my children at home, wondering if I'd see them again. The fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: They handcuffed me so tightly, my wrists hurt. I was sobbing, begging them to listen, to check my ID. But they just shoved me into the police car. I felt so humiliated, so violated. People were watching from their windows, and I felt ashamed, even though I knew I hadn't done anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) At the station, they finally checked my ID and realized their mistake. But there was no apology, no explanation. They just uncuffed me and told me to leave. I felt numb walking out of there. When I got home, I broke down. I couldn't stop shaking. I felt so angry, so betrayed by the very people who were supposed to protect me.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel a mix of emotions. There's still anger and fear, but also a sense of strength for being able to talk about it. It's hard to relive those moments, but I know it's part of healing. I just wish I could forget it all sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult, but I'm trying. I still struggle with trust issues, especially around authority figures. Sometimes, I have nightmares about that night. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling trapped. It's affected my work too. I get anxious in enclosed spaces or when someone approaches me from behind.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. Let's continue.",
    "Client: (nodding) The hardest part is explaining to my kids why I get nervous around police now. I don't want to pass on my fear to them, but I also want them to be cautious. It's a delicate balance. My husband has been supportive, but I know he doesn't fully understand what I'm going through. Sometimes I feel so alone in this.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We're here to work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. There are days when I feel stronger, like I'm moving past this. But then something will trigger a memory - a siren, a uniformed officer, even just walking alone at night - and suddenly I'm right back there, feeling helpless and scared. It's frustrating how much power this incident still has over me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these reactions. You're processing trauma.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes I get so angry at myself for not being \"over it\" yet. I was always strong and independent, and now I feel like I'm constantly looking over my shoulder. I've started avoiding certain areas of town, taking longer routes home just to avoid where it happened. It feels like my world has shrunk.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're facing this courageously.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to remind myself that it wasn't my fault, that I didn't do anything to deserve this. But there's still a part of me that wonders if I could have done something differently. If I had spoken more calmly, or if I had been dressed differently... I know it's not rational, but these thoughts keep creeping in.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have those thoughts. You're not to blame.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally it's harder to accept. I've been thinking about filing a formal complaint, but I'm scared of retaliation. What if they don't believe me? What if it makes things worse? But then I think about other people who might go through the same thing, and I feel like I should speak up. It's such a difficult decision.",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength in considering all options. We'll work through this.",
    "Client: (sighing) I hope so. I want to feel like myself again. I want to walk down the street without fear, to trust that the system works. But right now, it feels like such a long journey ahead. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this.",
    "Therapist: Recovery is possible. You're making important steps.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just hard to see the progress sometimes. But being able to talk about it like this, without completely breaking down, that's something, isn't it? I couldn't have done this a few months ago. I guess that's a sign that I'm moving forward, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown tremendous growth.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment now. This has been intense, but... helpful. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've shared some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a break."
