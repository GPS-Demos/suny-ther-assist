    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the cyber bullying incident, and it's bringing up a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing. I can feel it happening now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... So, it started about three months ago. I received this message on social media from an anonymous account. They said they knew where I worked and threatened to send embarrassing photos to my colleagues if I didn't comply with their demands.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I felt so powerless. My hands were shaking as I read the message. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. I'm a professional, I'm 52 years old, and yet here I was, being threatened like a teenager.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I didn't know what to do. I was too ashamed to tell anyone. I kept thinking about my past, about the physical abuse I endured. It felt like I was that helpless child again, unable to defend myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The demands started small. They wanted me to send them money. I did it, hoping it would end there. But it didn't. They kept asking for more, threatening to expose me if I didn't comply.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep. Every notification on my phone made me jump. I started calling in sick to work because I was terrified of facing my colleagues, wondering if they had seen anything.",
    "Therapist: That must have been so difficult. You're doing great sharing this.",
    "Client: It was. I felt so alone. Living by myself, I had no one to turn to. I started having nightmares about my childhood abuse, mixing with the current situation. In my dreams, my abuser from the past was now online, tormenting me.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. These are just memories.",
    "Client: I know, but they feel so real. One day, I broke down at work. A colleague found me crying in the bathroom. That's when I finally told someone what was happening.",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of courage. How do you feel now, talking about it?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest feels tight, and I'm fighting back tears. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm not carrying this secret anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I keep reminding myself that I'm not that helpless child anymore, and I'm not alone in facing this cyber bullying either.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You have support now.",
    "Client: Yes, I do. My colleagues have been understanding, and the IT department at work is helping me secure my accounts. But sometimes, I still feel so vulnerable. Like anyone could hurt me at any time.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: I am. And I'm trying to be kinder to myself. I keep thinking about how my Latin American family always taught me to be strong, to never show weakness. But now I'm learning that asking for help is a kind of strength too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. Like I'm breaking a cycle. Not just the cycle of abuse from my childhood, but also the cycle of silence and shame that kept me from seeking help with this cyber bullying.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still a struggle every day, but I'm starting to see a way forward. I'm not letting this define me, just like I didn't let my past abuse define me. I'm more than what's happened to me.",
    "Therapist: That's a strong statement. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... tired, but also a bit stronger. Talking about it like this, facing these memories... it's exhausting, but I think it's helping. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's part of the healing process.",
    "Client: I'm glad to hear that. I want to keep working on this, to get to a place where these memories don't have such power over me. I want to feel safe again, both online and in the real world.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment, especially given my age and professional status. I felt so foolish for falling victim to this.",
    "Therapist: You're not foolish. This can happen to anyone.",
    "Client: You're right. I'm trying to internalize that. It's a process, but I'm committed to it. I want to reclaim my life, my peace of mind.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and relief.",
    "Therapist: That's common after these sessions. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it will be challenging. But I feel like I'm making progress, and that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: You are making progress. We'll continue next time."
