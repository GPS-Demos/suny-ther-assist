    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of being trapped in that warehouse... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the musty air and feel the cold concrete floor. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Remembering how I felt so powerless, unable to escape or call for help. It's frustrating because now I know I should've done something differently, but back then... I just froze. I keep replaying that moment when the trafficker threatened me, and I just... gave in.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on that moment make you feel now?",
    "Client: Angry. Mostly at myself. I feel like I should've been stronger or smarter. But also scared. It's like... even though I know I'm safe now, part of me is still there, still afraid it could happen again. And then I feel guilty for not being able to just move on.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. How do these emotions connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I guess... well, I've been having trouble trusting people lately. Even my girlfriend - sometimes I pull away from her without meaning to. And in class, if someone raises their voice or moves suddenly, I get this jolt of panic. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What have you noticed about managing these reactions?",
    "Client: It's hard. Sometimes I try to distract myself, but that doesn't really work. Other times, I've been trying those breathing exercises we talked about. They help a bit, but... I don't know. It feels like a constant battle.",
    "Therapist: You're putting in a lot of effort. What's motivating you to keep working through this?",
    "Client: I... I want my life back, you know? I want to be able to enjoy things again, to feel safe. And I want to be there for my girlfriend and my family without all this... baggage. Sometimes it feels impossible, but then I think about how far I've come already. Like, a few months ago, I couldn't even talk about what happened without having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's helped you get to this point?",
    "Client: I think... facing it head-on, as scary as it is. These exposures are tough, but they're also... I don't know, empowering? Like, each time I get through one, I feel a little stronger. And having a safe space to process it all... that's been huge.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this work relates to your overall recovery?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm reclaiming pieces of myself, bit by bit. Each session, each exposure, it's like I'm taking back some control that was stolen from me. It's slow, and sometimes it feels like I'm going backwards, but... I can see a future now where I'm not defined by what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's next for you in this journey?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe... maybe start opening up more to my girlfriend about what I'm going through. And I think I want to try joining that support group you mentioned. It's scary, but I think it might help to connect with others who've been through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How can we support you in taking them?",
    "Client: Could we... maybe role-play some conversations? Like, how to talk to my girlfriend about this? And maybe go over some coping strategies for when I'm feeling overwhelmed in group settings? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that next session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. I'm here to support you. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, definitely. Thanks again. See you then."
