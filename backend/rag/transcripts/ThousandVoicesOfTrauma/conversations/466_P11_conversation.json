    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The airplane crash scenario... it felt so real. My heart's still racing a bit, to be honest. I keep seeing flashes of the plane descending, you know? And that feeling of helplessness... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The noise. The engines were so loud, and people were screaming. It reminded me of... of when I was little, and my parents would argue. I'd feel so powerless, just like in the plane. And then there was this moment of eerie calm right before impact. It was... unsettling.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your past?",
    "Client: I guess... it's that feeling of having no control. In the crash scenario, I couldn't do anything to save myself or others. It's like when I was a kid, and my parents would neglect me. I'd try to be perfect, to get their attention, but nothing worked. I felt... invisible.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did reliving that affect you?",
    "Client: It was tough. My anxiety spiked, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... I also noticed that I could breathe through it. I used those grounding techniques we practiced. It helped, but I still felt pretty shaken.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I realized that even though the crash scenario was terrifying, it wasn't real. My childhood neglect was real, but... I'm not that helpless kid anymore. I have more resources now, more control over my life. It's... it's empowering to recognize that.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I can use it to challenge my anxiety. When I start feeling overwhelmed or out of control, I can remind myself that I'm not powerless anymore. I have skills, I have support. It's not easy, but... I feel like I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's hard, and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. But... I can see changes. I'm sleeping a bit better, and I've been able to go to work without as much anxiety. So, yeah, I want to keep going. It's tough, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: Um... maybe we could work more on my fear of abandonment? It came up during the imaginal exposure, and I think it's connected to the neglect I experienced. I'd like to explore that more, if that's okay.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel... I don't know, supported? Like I'm not alone in this anymore. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my place. Being in nature helps calm me down. And maybe I'll call my sister. She's been really supportive throughout this process. Oh, and I'll make sure to do my breathing exercises before bed.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thanks again. I'll see you then."
