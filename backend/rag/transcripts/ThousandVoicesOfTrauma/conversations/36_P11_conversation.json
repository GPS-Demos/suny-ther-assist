    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that dog attack feels so vivid now. I can still hear the growling, you know? And my heart's still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear, definitely. It was overwhelming. I remember freezing up completely when I saw the dog running towards me. I couldn't move, couldn't think. And then the pain when it bit my arm... God, it was excruciating. I keep replaying that moment in my head now.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that?",
    "Client: It's... difficult. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieving? I've never really talked about it in such detail before. I've always tried to push it away, you know? But now it's like I'm facing it head-on. It's scary, but also... maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this incident has affected me. I mean, I knew I was afraid of dogs after that, but I didn't realize how deep it went. Even now, I tense up when I hear a dog bark in the distance. And I've been avoiding parks and outdoor activities because of it. It's like this fear has been controlling my life without me even realizing it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I want to feel normal again, you know? I want to be able to go for a walk in the park without constantly looking over my shoulder. And I want to be able to visit friends who have dogs without panicking. I guess... I want my freedom back. This fear has been like a cage, and I want out.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. What's helping you work towards them?",
    "Client: Um, I think... talking about it like this helps. It's hard, but it feels like I'm taking control back, bit by bit. And the breathing exercises we've been practicing have been really useful when I start to feel anxious. Oh, and writing in my journal about the experience... it's tough, but it helps me process things.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. What's been challenging?",
    "Client: The nightmares, definitely. They've gotten more intense since we started these sessions. And sometimes, I feel like I'm going backwards, you know? Like, I'll have a good day where I feel strong, and then suddenly I'll smell something that reminds me of that day, and I'm right back in that panic mode.",
    "Therapist: That's normal in recovery. How are you coping with those moments?",
    "Client: I try to use the grounding techniques we've discussed. Focusing on my breath, naming objects around me. It helps... sometimes. Other times, I call my sister. She's been really supportive through all this. And, um... I've been trying to cut back on the drinking. I know it's not a good way to cope.",
    "Therapist: That's commendable. What's motivating you to make these changes?",
    "Client: I guess... I want my life back. I want to be present for my family, to enjoy things again. And I'm tired of feeling scared all the time. I want to be stronger than this fear, you know? I want to be able to look at a dog and see just a dog, not a threat.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But... I think it's worth it. I can already feel small changes, like being able to talk about the attack without completely breaking down. And that gives me hope. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also... kind of excited? Like, maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. What's your focus for this week?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try walking past the dog park near my house. Not go in, just walk by. Baby steps, right? And maybe write about it afterwards, how I felt, what I was thinking. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like an excellent plan. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. Thank you for listening. This is tough, but... I'm glad I'm doing it. I feel like I'm finally facing this head-on instead of running away from it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again."
