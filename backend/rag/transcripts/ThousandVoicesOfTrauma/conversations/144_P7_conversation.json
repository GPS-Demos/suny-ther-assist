    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe your refugee experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about 20 years ago. We had to leave our village in the middle of the night. The sounds of gunfire were getting closer. I remember my mother frantically packing a small bag, her hands shaking...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I see my younger siblings crying silently, afraid to make noise. The fear in their eyes... it was suffocating. We left everything behind - our home, our memories. As we walked through the dark jungle, I kept looking back, hoping to see our house one last time, but it was gone forever.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The jungle was so dark and scary. Every sound made us jump. We walked for hours, my feet were bleeding, but we couldn't stop. I was carrying my youngest sister. She was so light, probably from malnutrition. I remember feeling so angry and helpless...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: We reached a refugee camp after days of walking. The conditions were horrible. Overcrowded, unsanitary. I remember the smell - a mix of sweat, fear, and despair. Food was scarce. I often gave my portion to my siblings. I felt so responsible for them, but also so inadequate...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the feeling of being trapped. We couldn't go back home, but we had nowhere else to go. I felt like my life was on pause. Years were passing, and I was stuck in this limbo. I tried to stay strong for my family, but inside, I was crumbling. The uncertainty, the lack of control over our lives... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel a tightness in my chest. My hands are sweating. It's like I'm back there, feeling that same helplessness and fear. But also... I feel angry. Why did this have to happen to us? We didn't do anything wrong...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember one night, there was a commotion in the camp. Some people were being relocated. The panic that spread was intense. Everyone was afraid of being separated from their families. I held onto my siblings so tightly, promising I wouldn't let anyone take them away. But deep down, I knew I had no control...",
    "Therapist: You're handling these memories well. Continue.",
    "Client: Years passed in that camp. I watched my siblings grow up in that environment, and it broke my heart. They deserved so much better. I tried to teach them, to keep their minds active, but resources were so limited. I felt like I was failing them every day. The guilt... it still eats at me sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to express these feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: When we finally got the news that we could leave, I felt relieved but also terrified. We were going to a country we knew nothing about. I was excited for the opportunity but scared of the unknown. Leaving the camp was bittersweet. It had been a horrible place, but it had also been our home for years...",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Talking about this brings back so many emotions. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and sharing it makes it a little lighter. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe it's okay to acknowledge that pain.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never really talk about this, you know? It's like I've been running from these memories for years. But facing them... it's hard, but maybe it's necessary. I just hope I can learn to live with this part of my past without letting it control my present.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful goal. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's still difficult to process everything. Sometimes I wonder how different my life would have been if we hadn't had to flee. But then I think about the opportunities I've had here, despite the challenges. It's a constant internal struggle.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have mixed feelings. You're processing well.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... even after all these years, certain things can trigger these memories. A loud noise, a crowded place, even certain smells. Suddenly, I'm that scared young man in the refugee camp again. I want to move past this, but it feels like it's always there, just beneath the surface.",
    "Therapist: We'll work on managing those triggers. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to think about my past without feeling overwhelmed. I want to honor my experiences and the strength it took to survive, but I don't want to be defined by them. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It is. We'll work towards that goal together.",
    "Client: Thank you. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. It's exhausting, but also... I don't know, maybe liberating in a way? Like I'm finally facing something I've been running from for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll end here for today."
