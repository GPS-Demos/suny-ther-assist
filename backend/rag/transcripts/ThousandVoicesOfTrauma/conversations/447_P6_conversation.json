    "Therapist: Okay, Carlos. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Martinez. I'm nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm... I'm back in the compound. The air is thick with incense. I can hear chanting in the background. My heart is racing as I approach the inner sanctum. I know what's coming, but I can't stop it.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The leader, he... he's there. Smiling at me. Says I'm \"chosen.\" My stomach churns. I want to run, but my feet won't move. He reaches out, touches my shoulder. I feel... dirty. Ashamed.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweaty, and I feel light-headed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) He's leading me to the altar. Others are watching. I'm shaking. I can smell his breath - peppermint and tobacco. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. He's... he's removing my robe. I feel so exposed, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Choked up) It's... it's a 9. I can barely breathe. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) He's... he's touching me. Everywhere. Says it's \"divine love.\" But it's not. It's violation. It's pain. I'm frozen, can't move. Just endure. Praying for it to end.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Gasping) Ten! It's a ten! I can't... I can't do this!",
    "Therapist: You can. You're safe here. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: (Takes shaky breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here. It's over. He's gone. I'm alone on the altar. Feeling... broken. Used. But... alive.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Coming down... maybe an 8? My heart's still racing, but I can breathe easier.",
    "Therapist: Good job. Let's ground you. What do you see in this room?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) I see... your bookshelf. The blue painting. My hands... they're shaking, but they're mine. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. SUDS?",
    "Client: Down to a 6, I think. I feel drained, but... relieved? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Very. You did great. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted. But... stronger? Like I faced a monster and survived. It's still awful, but... maybe I can handle it?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. We'll end here. Well done, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Martinez. I... I never thought I could talk about this. It's still hard, but... it feels a little lighter now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue next week. Take care."
