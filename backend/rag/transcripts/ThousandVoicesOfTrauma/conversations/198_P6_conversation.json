    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you're in control here. Can you start by describing the scene of your car accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving home from work. It's late, maybe 9 PM. The road is dark, and it's starting to rain. I can feel my hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. I'm tired and just want to get home to my family.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm a bit tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The rain is getting heavier. I can barely see through the windshield. Suddenly, I see headlights coming straight at me. They're in my lane! My heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I try to swerve, but it's too late. There's a deafening crash, and everything goes black.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7 now. My palms are sweaty, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I come to, and there's glass everywhere. The airbag has deployed, and I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm disoriented and scared. I hear someone shouting, but it sounds far away. I try to move, but I'm stuck. The pain hits me all at once, and I start to panic. What if I never see my family again?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting closer. I'm crying now, scared and in pain. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. Someone's at my window, telling me help is coming. But I can't stop thinking about my kids, my husband. What if I die here?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling? SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel so helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The firefighters are working to get me out. I hear metal creaking and groaning. They're talking to me, but I can barely focus. Finally, they free me from the car. As they lift me onto a stretcher, I catch a glimpse of the other driver. He's not moving. Oh God, what if he's dead? Is it my fault?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I'm still shaken, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing it. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, everything's a blur. Lights, voices, pain. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one will tell me anything. At the hospital, there are tests, doctors, questions. I'm in shock, I think. It's not until my husband arrives that I break down completely. The relief of seeing him, mixed with the trauma of what happened... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's pause here."
