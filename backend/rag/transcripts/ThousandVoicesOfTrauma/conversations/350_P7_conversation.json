    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in my seat, feeling nervous about the flight. The plane takes off, and everything seems normal at first. Then, there's a sudden jolt. The oxygen masks drop down, and people start panicking. I can hear screaming all around me. The plane is shaking violently, and I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white. I'm terrified, thinking about my family and how I might never see them again. The flight attendants are trying to calm everyone down, but their voices are shaking too. I can see the fear in their eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane starts to nosedive. I can feel my stomach lurching. The cabin is filled with a deafening roar of the engines and people's screams. I'm frozen in my seat, unable to move. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I'm sweating, and I can't breathe properly. I'm thinking about my late wife and how I'll be joining her soon. I'm not ready to die. I don't want to leave my children alone. The oxygen mask isn't helping; I feel like I'm suffocating.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The impact is violent. There's a loud crash, and everything goes dark for a moment. When I come to, I'm upside down, still strapped to my seat. There's smoke everywhere, and I can smell fuel. People around me are moaning in pain. Some aren't moving at all. I'm in shock, but I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt and fall to what used to be the ceiling of the plane. My legs are shaky, and I'm disoriented. I can hear the crackling of flames nearby. I'm crawling over debris and... and bodies... trying to find a way out. The smoke is getting thicker, and I'm coughing uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I see a crack in the fuselage and start pushing my way through it. My hands are cut and bleeding from the sharp metal edges. As I squeeze through the opening, I fall onto the ground outside. The heat from the flames is intense, and I can hear explosions from inside the plane. I stumble away, looking back at the wreckage. It's a horrifying scene \u2013 the plane is broken into pieces, and there are fires everywhere. I collapse on the ground, gasping for air, my whole body shaking. I'm alive, but I'm overwhelmed with guilt. Why did I survive when so many others didn't? I can still hear screams from inside the plane, but I'm too weak to go back and help. I just lie there, crying and trembling, waiting for help to arrive.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The wait feels like an eternity. I'm in shock, replaying the crash in my mind over and over. When I finally hear sirens in the distance, I feel a mix of relief and dread. Relief that help is coming, but dread at facing the reality of what just happened. As the emergency responders arrive, I'm barely able to speak. They're asking me questions, but I can't focus. All I can think about are the people still trapped in the plane. The guilt is overwhelming. I survived, but at what cost? The images of the crash, the sounds of screams, the smell of smoke and fuel \u2013 they're all burned into my memory. I know these sensations will haunt me for years to come.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky and drained. Talking about it brings back all those intense emotions \u2013 the fear, the helplessness, the guilt. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit lightheaded. But at the same time, there's a small sense of relief. Like I've finally let out something I've been holding in for so long. It's strange, but I also feel a bit proud that I managed to get through describing it all. I didn't think I could do it without breaking down completely.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You did well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to process everything that happened. I keep thinking about the what-ifs. What if I had tried to help more people? What if I had chosen a different flight? The survivors' guilt is something I struggle with daily. And the fear... the fear of flying now is paralyzing. I haven't been able to even consider getting on a plane since then. Every time I see or hear a plane, I tense up. It's affecting my work, my relationships with my children. They want to travel, to visit places, but I can't bring myself to join them. I feel like I'm letting them down, but the thought of getting on a plane again terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... it's not just the fear of flying. It's the nightmares, the flashbacks. Sometimes I'll be doing something completely ordinary, like washing dishes, and suddenly I'm back in that plane, feeling it plummet. The smell of smoke can trigger a panic attack. Loud, unexpected noises make me jump. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster to strike. And then there's the guilt again. I survived when others didn't. I have a chance to live, to be with my family, but I'm struggling to enjoy it because of this constant fear and anxiety. It's like I'm not fully living, just existing. I want to get better, for myself and for my children, but sometimes it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is draining, but there's a small sense of accomplishment. It's like I've faced the memory head-on for the first time, instead of trying to push it away. I'm still shaky and my heart is still racing a bit, but I also feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, if I can talk about it like this, I can start to process it better. I know it's going to be a long journey, but for the first time in a while, I feel like healing might actually be possible. I'm scared of what other memories and emotions might come up as we continue this therapy, but I'm also determined to keep trying. For my kids, and for myself.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. We'll end here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad I did it. I know we have a long way to go, but I feel like I've taken an important step today. I'm nervous about our next session, but also looking forward to it in a way. I want to get better, to be able to live my life fully again. I hope that by continuing to face these memories and work through them, I can start to reduce their power over me. Thank you for guiding me through this. I'll try to practice some of the coping techniques we've discussed before our next session. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. We'll continue next time."
