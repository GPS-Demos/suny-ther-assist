    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of witnessing that violence, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. I feel like that little girl again, helpless and scared. I remember hiding in the closet, trying to make myself as small as possible. My hands are actually shaking now, just like they did back then. It's like... like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. And as you're feeling this, where do you notice it in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. My stomach is in knots, and I feel nauseous. My shoulders are so tense they're almost up to my ears. And there's this heaviness on my chest, like I can't breathe properly. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do something?\" I know I was just a child, but part of me still feels guilty. Like maybe if I had been braver, I could have stopped it somehow. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're not safe. It could happen again at any moment.\" It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Well, they're... they're still intense, but I think I can recognize them better now. Before, I would just feel overwhelmed and shut down. Now, I can at least name what I'm feeling. And... (pauses) I guess I'm able to talk about it more. Before, I would have just tried to push it all away.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I suppose it means I'm making progress, right? Even though it still hurts so much, being able to face it feels... I don't know, empowering in a way? Like I'm taking back some control. But it's also terrifying. Part of me still wants to run away from all of this.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed feelings. What helps you stay present?",
    "Client: Honestly? Knowing that you're here, listening. And... and reminding myself that I'm an adult now, that I'm safe. The grounding techniques we've practiced help too. Like focusing on my breath or the feeling of my feet on the floor. It... it brings me back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Those are great strategies. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I think... I think I need to keep going. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to be able to feel safe, to not jump at every loud noise or get panicky when I see people arguing. I want to be present for my family without these memories constantly intruding. So yes, it's difficult, but I'm... I'm committed to this process.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need reassurance sometimes. That what I'm feeling is normal, that it's okay to struggle. And maybe... maybe some more tools to cope with the intense emotions when they come up. Oh, and... (hesitates) I think I might need help talking to my husband about this. He's supportive, but I don't think he really understands what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid needs. We'll work on those together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, to be honest. But also a bit lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I'm still shaky, but the tightness in my chest has eased a little. And even though it was really hard, I feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit proud of myself for getting through it?",
    "Therapist: That's a big accomplishment. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on coping strategies for when the memories hit unexpectedly. And maybe... maybe we could start talking about how to explain this to my family? I've been keeping them at arm's length, and I don't want to do that anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. We'll start there next session. How do you want to close today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we do that breathing exercise again? The one where we count? I think that might help me feel more grounded before I leave.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin..."
