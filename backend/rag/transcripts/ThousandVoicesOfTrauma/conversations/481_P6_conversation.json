    "Therapist: Alright, Carlos, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you're in control here. Can you start by describing the scene of the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the park near my house. It's a sunny day, and I can hear kids playing in the distance. I'm walking my neighbor's dog - a big German Shepherd. Everything seems normal at first...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 3 or 4. I'm a bit nervous, but okay so far.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: So, we're walking along the path, and suddenly this huge Rottweiler comes out of nowhere. It's growling and charging straight at us. I freeze up, my heart starts racing. The German Shepherd I'm walking starts barking and pulling on the leash. I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The Rottweiler attacks. It's all teeth and snarling. The German Shepherd is fighting back, but I can't hold onto the leash. I fall to the ground, and... and... I can feel the Rottweiler's teeth on my arm. I'm screaming, but no one's coming to help. It's like I'm back there again...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Carlos. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Like an 8 or 9. My heart's pounding, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're here with me, not in that park.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I know. It just feels so real. I can smell the grass, feel the pain in my arm. I'm so scared and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I manage to kick the Rottweiler away. There's blood on my arm, and I'm crying. The German Shepherd is whimpering. I hear someone shouting and running towards us. It's the Rottweiler's owner. He's pulling his dog away, apologizing, but I can barely hear him. I just want to go home...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the ambulance coming. The paramedics are kind, but I can't stop shaking. They're asking me questions, but I can barely speak. I keep looking at my arm, seeing the bite marks. It reminds me of... of the other time. When I was... when the abuse happened.",
    "Therapist: I see. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. My chest feels tight. It's hard to separate the two memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here, Carlos.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It's just... both times, I felt so helpless. Like I couldn't do anything to stop it. I hate feeling that way.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. Can we pause?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: (After a few moments) Okay, I think I'm ready to continue. The paramedics are treating my arm, and I'm starting to calm down a little. The park seems quieter now, like everything's moving in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 6, I think. I still feel anxious, but not as panicked.",
    "Therapist: That's improvement. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're taking me to the hospital. I remember feeling numb during the ride. At the hospital, they clean and bandage my arm. A police officer comes to take a statement, but I can barely focus on what he's saying. All I can think about is how I froze up, how I couldn't protect myself... again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is probably a 5. I feel... I feel sad and angry. Why does this keep happening to me?",
