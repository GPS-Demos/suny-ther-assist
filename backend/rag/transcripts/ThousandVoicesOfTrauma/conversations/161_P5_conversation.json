    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting the car accident... it makes my heart race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving the accident might be too overwhelming. I've worked so hard to keep those memories at bay. What if I can't handle it? And... I'm not sure how this will help me in the long run.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Imaginal exposure can feel daunting, but it's a crucial step in healing. How do you think it might benefit you?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've been avoiding thinking about the accident for so long. But I'm still not sure how facing it head-on will make things better. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How do you think avoidance has affected you?",
    "Client: Now that you mention it, I realize avoidance has really limited my life. I don't drive anymore, I avoid busy roads even as a passenger, and I've missed out on so many family events because I'm afraid to travel. It's isolating, and I hate feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Imaginal exposure aims to reduce those limitations. Are you ready to learn more about the process?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm still nervous, but I'm willing to give it a try if it means I might get my life back. Can you walk me through what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start by having you recount the accident in detail. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Will I have to close my eyes? I'm worried about feeling trapped in the memory. And... how long will we do this for? I'm concerned about getting too overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You can keep your eyes open if you prefer. We'll start with short sessions and gradually increase. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I think I can manage that. But what if I start panicking during the exercise? I'm worried I might have a complete meltdown.",
    "Therapist: Your safety is my priority. We'll establish a signal if you need a break. How would you like to indicate that?",
    "Client: Maybe I could raise my hand? That seems simple enough. It's comforting to know I have an 'escape hatch' if things get too intense. I appreciate your thoughtfulness about this.",
    "Therapist: Raising your hand works well. Remember, you're in control. What else would help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Could we maybe have some water nearby? And... I know this might sound silly, but could I bring a small comfort object? I have this smooth stone I often hold when I'm anxious.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the process?",
    "Client: I'm curious about what happens after we do the exposure part. Will we discuss it? How will I know if it's working?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we'll process your experience afterwards. We'll track your progress weekly. Does this address your question?",
    "Client: Yes, that helps. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. This is the first time I've felt like there might be a way forward. Thank you for your patience with all my questions.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our first imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm scared, but I'm ready to take this step. I want to reclaim my life, and if this is the path to get there, then I'm willing to face it. Thank you for guiding me through this."
