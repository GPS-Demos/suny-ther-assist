    "Therapist: Welcome, Alex. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is doing somersaults.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day?",
    "Client: Okay... (deep breath) I'm at the airport. It's bustling, people rushing everywhere. The smell of coffee and fast food is in the air. I'm... I'm excited about my trip, but there's this underlying anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 4? It's not too bad yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm walking towards the gate. My backpack feels heavy on my shoulders. I can hear announcements echoing through the terminal. As I get closer to the gate, my heart starts beating faster. I... I can see the plane through the window. It looks so big, so... intimidating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I board the plane. The narrow aisle, the cramped seats. I'm fumbling with my ticket, trying to find my seat. 32B. Window seat. I sit down and... oh god, the walls feel like they're closing in.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane starts to move. I can feel the vibrations through my seat. My palms are sweaty, I'm gripping the armrests. The engines are so loud. We're accelerating down the runway and... and... (voice shaking) I can't breathe. It feels like my chest is being crushed.",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Alex. Take a slow, deep breath with me.",
    "Client: (audible inhale and exhale) Okay... okay. We're in the air now. Every little bump, every bit of turbulence sends a jolt of panic through me. I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if we lose an engine? What if there's a terrorist on board? What if...",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I... I see people reading magazines, a kid playing on a tablet. The flight attendants are starting their service. But all I can focus on is the slight shaking of the plane. My heart is racing. I feel trapped. I want to scream, to run, but there's nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 or 9. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (shaky breath) Okay... We've been flying for a while now. I've been trying to distract myself with a book, but I can't focus. Every little sound makes me jump. Then... then there's a loud bang. The plane shudders. People are gasping, looking around frantically.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down. There's chaos, people screaming. I'm fumbling with my mask, my hands are shaking so badly. The plane is diving, I can feel the pressure in my ears. Oh god, we're going to crash. We're going to die. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Alex. This is just a memory. Can you ground yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying. (deep, shaky breath) I can feel the chair I'm sitting in. I can hear your voice. But it feels so real...",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep focusing on the present. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The... the plane is still falling. People are praying, crying. I'm frozen in my seat, can't even scream. The ground is getting closer through the window. I close my eyes, brace for impact. There's a deafening crash, the sensation of being thrown forward. Then... silence.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Alex. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... I... I open my eyes. The plane is in pieces around me. There's smoke, debris everywhere. I'm still strapped to my seat, but I'm on the ground now. I can hear moans, cries for help. I'm in shock, I think. My body hurts, but I can move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I unbuckle my seatbelt with shaking hands. Stand up, stumbling. There are people lying motionless around me. I want to help, but I don't know how. I'm overwhelmed, terrified. I start walking, limping really, towards a break in the wreckage.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, but also guilty. Why did I survive when others didn't? I should be doing more to help, but I'm just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal feelings after such a traumatic event. What happens as you move through the wreckage?",
    "Client: I make it outside. The sun is blinding after the darkness of the plane. I can smell fuel, smoke. In the distance, I hear sirens. People are stumbling around, dazed. Some are helping others. I... I sit down on the ground, unable to process what's happening.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you describe what happens next?",
    "Client: Emergency services arrive. There's a flurry of activity. Paramedics are checking people, firefighters are dousing flames. Someone comes to me, asks if I'm hurt. I can't even speak, just shake my head. They guide me to an ambulance, check me over.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as this is happening?",
    "Client: Numb. Completely numb. It's like I'm watching everything from outside my body. I can't believe this is real. I keep expecting to wake up.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. What happens after the medical check?",
    "Client: They... they take me to a hospital. There are so many of us. Injured people everywhere. I'm in a daze as they run tests, ask me questions. I can't stop thinking about the others on the plane. Who made it? Who didn't?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: Guilt. So much guilt. Why did I survive? What makes me special? And fear. I'm terrified of ever getting on a plane again. I keep replaying the crash in my mind, over and over.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How are you feeling now, as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is still racing, but I feel more... present. Like I can separate myself from the memory a bit more.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Alex. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4, I think. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's very common after processing trauma. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: (audible deep breaths) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll continue working through this in our next session. For now, let's focus on some grounding techniques to help you transition back to the present."
