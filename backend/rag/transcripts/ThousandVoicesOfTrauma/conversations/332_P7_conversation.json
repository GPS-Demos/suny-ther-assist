    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the night of the home invasion?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my apartment, alone. It was late, maybe around 11 PM. I was getting ready for bed when I heard a noise at the front door. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but then I heard it again, louder this time. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, not sure what to do. Then I heard the sound of the lock being picked. I panicked and ran to my bedroom, trying to find my phone to call for help. But before I could, I heard the door open. Heavy footsteps entered my apartment. I was trembling, trying to stay quiet...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The footsteps were getting closer to my bedroom. I could hear them searching the apartment, opening drawers, rustling through things. I was terrified, thinking about what they might do if they found me. I considered jumping out the window, but I was on the third floor...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, my bedroom door burst open. Two men in masks were there. One grabbed me and pushed me onto the bed. I tried to scream, but he covered my mouth. The other one started going through my drawers. I felt so helpless, so violated...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: They kept asking where I kept my valuables. I was crying, trying to tell them I didn't have much. The one holding me down... he... he started touching me inappropriately. I felt disgusted and terrified. I wanted to fight back, but I was paralyzed with fear...",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous for sharing this. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I don't know how long it lasted. It felt like hours, but it was probably only minutes. They eventually found my laptop and some cash. Before they left, the one who touched me whispered something threatening in my ear. I can't remember exactly what, but it made me feel like they might come back...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel shaky and nauseous. My heart is pounding, just like it did that night. I can still feel their hands on me... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here.",
    "Client: After they left, I just lay there, frozen. I couldn't move for what felt like hours. I was too scared to call the police at first, worried they might come back if they heard sirens. When I finally did call, I felt so ashamed and dirty. I couldn't stop shaking when the officers arrived...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The days after were a blur. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every little noise made me jump. I kept replaying the invasion in my mind, thinking of what I could have done differently. I felt so angry at myself for not fighting back more...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You survived.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. I moved out of that apartment as soon as I could, but I still have nightmares. Sometimes I wake up feeling like there's someone in my room. I've become so paranoid about security. I check the locks multiple times every night...",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: The worst part is the feeling that I'm not safe anywhere. Even in my new place, I'm constantly on edge. I struggle to trust people, especially men. It's affecting my relationship... I feel like I'm not the same person I was before this happened.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress by talking about this.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be this anxious, this scared? I want to move past this, but it feels like it's controlling my life. I'm tired of feeling like a victim...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're incredibly resilient.",
    "Client: Thank you... I guess I am resilient, aren't I? I'm still here, still fighting. It's hard, but talking about it like this... it helps. It makes it feel less overwhelming, less like a dark secret I have to carry alone.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're doing great work here.",
    "Client: I want to be able to feel safe again, to trust people. I know it'll take time, but I'm committed to working through this. I don't want those men to have power over me anymore. I want to reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am proud, actually. It's not easy to talk about this, but I'm doing it. And even though it's painful, I can feel that it's helping. I'm starting to see that what happened doesn't define me. I'm more than just a victim of a home invasion.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing remarkable courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a break now, if that's okay. This has been intense, but... good. I feel like I've taken a step forward today.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today."
