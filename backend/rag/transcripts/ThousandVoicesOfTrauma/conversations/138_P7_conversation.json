    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure where to start. It was about five years ago when I first got involved. I was feeling lost, you know? My business was struggling, and I felt like I needed some direction in life. That's when I met Sarah at a local community event. She seemed so confident and put-together. She told me about this group that had changed her life, and I was intrigued.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue sharing what happened next.",
    "Client: Well, I decided to attend one of their meetings. It was in this old warehouse on the outskirts of town. When I walked in, everyone was so welcoming. They all had these big smiles and kept telling me how glad they were that I had come. It felt... nice, at first. Like I belonged somewhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The leader, James, he had this charisma about him. When he spoke, everyone listened intently. He talked about how society was broken and that only through their teachings could we find true happiness. I remember feeling skeptical at first, but also... drawn in. It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the weeks went by, I found myself spending more and more time with the group. They encouraged me to attend multiple meetings a week, to volunteer for their causes. I started neglecting my business, my family. My wife was worried, but I brushed off her concerns. I thought I had finally found my purpose.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel conflicted. You're safe here.",
    "Client: But then... things started to change. The demands became more intense. They wanted me to cut ties with anyone who wasn't part of the group. They said my family was holding me back from reaching my full potential. I... I actually considered it for a while. God, how could I have been so blind?",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Thanks. It's just... hard to talk about. The worst part was when they started asking for money. Large sums of money. They said it was for the \"greater good,\" but I could see James living lavishly while the rest of us struggled. That's when I started to realize something wasn't right.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Betrayed. Ashamed. I had put so much trust in these people, and they were taking advantage of me. But I was also scared. They had all this personal information about me, about my family. I didn't know what they might do if I tried to leave.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: It took me months to finally work up the courage to leave. I had to do it slowly, making excuses for why I couldn't attend meetings or contribute as much. When I finally told them I was done, they tried everything to keep me. Guilt, threats, promises of special knowledge. It was exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I still feel shame for falling for it all. But I also feel relief, you know? Like a weight has been lifted. Talking about it makes it feel less... powerful, I guess. Less scary.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I am. It's still difficult to trust people sometimes, especially in group settings. But I'm working on it. My wife has been incredibly supportive through all of this. I don't know where I'd be without her.",
    "Therapist: It's good that you have support. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's enough for today. It's exhausting to relive all of this, but I do feel a bit lighter. Thank you for listening and for your patience. I know it can't be easy to hear these things.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. I was dreading this session, but I'm glad we did it. It helps to talk about it, even if it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll end here for today."
