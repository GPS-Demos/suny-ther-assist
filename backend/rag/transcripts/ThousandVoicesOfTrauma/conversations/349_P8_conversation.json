    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep looking at the door, half-expecting someone to burst in. I know it's not rational, but...",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was frozen, couldn't even call for help. What if it happens again? I'm an old man now, I can't defend myself like I used to. It's... it's embarrassing, really. I should've been able to protect my home, my wife...",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... weak. Useless. I've always prided myself on being strong, you know? Providing for my family, keeping them safe. But that night... I couldn't do anything. I just lay there, pretending to be asleep, hoping they wouldn't come upstairs. What kind of man does that make me?",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up as you share this?",
    "Client: Shame, mostly. And anger. I'm angry at myself for not doing more. But I'm also angry at them, those men who invaded our home. They took more than just our belongings that night. They took my sense of security, my peace of mind. And now, living with my daughter's family, I feel like a burden. Like I couldn't even keep my own home safe, so how can I contribute to theirs?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your overall experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a turning point, I guess. Before that night, I felt in control of my life. I was retired, but still active, still felt useful. After... everything changed. The anxiety, the nightmares, always feeling on edge. It's like I'm a different person now. Sometimes I don't even recognize myself.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part for you right now?",
    "Client: The hardest part? I think... it's the loss of who I used to be. I used to be confident, outgoing. Now I'm always looking over my shoulder, second-guessing everything. I hate feeling this way, but I don't know how to stop it. It's like... like I'm trapped in my own mind, reliving that night over and over.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've never really talked about it like this before. My family, they try to understand, but they didn't experience it. They don't know what it's like to lie there, hearing strangers in your home, not knowing if they're armed or what they might do. But talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like... like I'm finally acknowledging what happened, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to just forget it all, go back to how things were. But I know that's not possible. I guess... I need to find a way to feel safe again. To trust that I can handle whatever comes my way. It's just... it's hard to imagine getting there from where I am now.",
    "Therapist: How might we work towards that goal?",
    "Client: I don't know... maybe... maybe learning some techniques to calm myself when I start feeling anxious? And... and maybe finding ways to feel more secure in my daughter's home? I've been thinking about taking up woodworking again, maybe I could install some extra security features. It might help me feel like I'm contributing, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good start. How else can we support you?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to talk more about that night. It's painful, but keeping it bottled up isn't helping. And maybe... maybe I need to reconnect with some old friends. I've been isolating myself, and I think that's making things worse. It's just... it's hard to explain to people why I've changed so much.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take this week?",
    "Client: I could... I could call my old fishing buddy, Tom. We used to go out every weekend. I've been avoiding him since... since it happened. Maybe I could suggest meeting for coffee. Just for an hour or so. That wouldn't be too overwhelming, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds manageable. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's a bit scary, to be honest. What if I have a panic attack while we're out? What if he doesn't understand why I've been so distant? But... but I also feel a little excited. I miss Tom. I miss having friends, having a life outside of my fears. Maybe... maybe this could be a first step towards getting some of that back.",
    "Therapist: What might help you feel more comfortable with this step?",
    "Client: I could... I could ask my daughter to drive me there. And maybe choose a quiet caf\u00e9, not too crowded. And I could practice some of those breathing exercises you taught me before I go. I think... I think I can do this. It won't be easy, but... but I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a great plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic, I guess. Still a bit shaky from the exposure exercise, but also... lighter? Like maybe there's a way forward that I couldn't see before. It's a small step, but it feels important. Thank you for... for helping me get here.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think this is enough for today. It's been intense, but good. I feel like I have something concrete to work on now. And talking about that night... it was hard, but I think it helped. It's not as overwhelming when I put it into words, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling pretty drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important. I'm looking forward to trying to reconnect with Tom. It's a small thing, but it feels like a big step for me.",
    "Therapist: It is a big step. We'll discuss how it went next time. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
