    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. The weather's been stormy lately, and it's bringing back some memories.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. What exactly does that mean? It sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to process your trauma. We'll revisit the event in a safe space. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly? It sounds scary. I've been trying so hard not to think about the earthquake and losing my sister. The idea of purposely remembering it... I don't know if I can do that.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. Many find it challenging at first. How can I help ease your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about falling apart. What if I can't handle it? And... will this really help? I've been avoiding these memories for so long.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this if I'm going to put myself through it.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the trauma, reducing its power over time. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense. It's just... every time I think about it, it feels so raw. Like it just happened yesterday. Will this really make that feeling go away?",
    "Therapist: It won't erase the memory, but it can lessen its impact. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but I want to get better. For my family, and for myself. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You might feel strong emotions. That's normal and okay. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds intense. Will you be there the whole time? I don't think I could do this alone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through it and provide support. You're not alone in this journey.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but knowing you'll be there helps. How long does this usually take? Is it just one session?",
    "Therapist: It's a process over multiple sessions. We'll go at your pace. How do you feel about that approach?",
    "Client: That's a relief, actually. I was worried we'd have to get through everything in one go. Knowing we can take it step by step makes it feel more manageable.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad that helps. Your courage is admirable. Do you have any other questions?",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I'm just wondering... how will I know if it's working? Will I feel different right away?",
    "Therapist: Changes often come gradually. We'll track your progress together. What are your hopes for this treatment?",
    "Client: I hope to be able to think about my sister without feeling overwhelmed by grief and guilt. And to not be so terrified every time there's a small tremor or loud noise. Is that realistic?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. This treatment can help achieve them. Shall we begin?",

    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your readiness is a big step. Let's start slowly. Are you comfortable?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm as comfortable as I can be. I'm taking deep breaths like you taught me. I'm ready to face this, even though it's scary.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, we're in this together. Let's begin..."
