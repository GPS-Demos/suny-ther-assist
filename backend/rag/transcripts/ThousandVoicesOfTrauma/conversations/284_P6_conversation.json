    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you start by describing the home invasion and give me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in bed, reading a book when I heard a crash downstairs. My heart started racing immediately. I froze, not knowing what to do. The sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs made my blood run cold. I... I can feel my hands shaking even now as I recall it. My initial SUDS rating would be about a 7.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Keep going, and remember to breathe.",
    "Client: As the footsteps got closer, I could hear multiple voices whispering. I wanted to call for help, but my throat felt tight, and I couldn't make a sound. The door handle started to turn, and I felt like I was going to pass out from fear. My whole body was trembling, and I felt so helpless... so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. My palms are sweating, and my heart is pounding just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The door burst open, and three masked men rushed in. One of them grabbed me and pushed me against the wall. I could smell alcohol on his breath, and it made me nauseous. They were shouting, demanding to know where we kept valuables. I couldn't speak; I was paralyzed with fear. One of them slapped me hard across the face, and that's when I started crying uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Keep going when you feel ready.",
    "Client: They ransacked the room, throwing things everywhere. I kept thinking about my wife and kids downstairs, praying they were safe. The men were getting more agitated, threatening to hurt me if I didn't tell them where the safe was. I didn't even have a safe. I felt so powerless, so ashamed that I couldn't protect my family. The fear was overwhelming, consuming every part of me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: One of them found my wife's jewelry box and seemed satisfied. They started to leave, but before they did, one of them leaned in close and whispered, \"If you call the cops, we'll come back and finish the job.\" I've never felt so terrified in my life. Even after they left, I couldn't move for what felt like hours. The fear of them coming back... it haunts me to this day.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved to have talked about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. It's hard, but I think it helps to talk about it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did well. We'll end here for today."
