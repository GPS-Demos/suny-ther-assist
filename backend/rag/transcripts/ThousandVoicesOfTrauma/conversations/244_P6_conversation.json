    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the moment of the animal attack. When you're ready, start describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the park near my house. It's a sunny day, and I see this big dog running towards me. Its teeth are bared, and I can hear it growling. My heart is racing, and I feel frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6 out of 10. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog is getting closer, and I can't move. I'm trying to yell for help, but no sound comes out. I feel so helpless, like I'm trapped in my own body.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My anxiety is increasing. I'd say it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue with what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The dog lunges at me, and I feel its teeth sink into my leg. The pain is excruciating, and I finally manage to scream. I'm terrified, thinking I might die. I can smell the dog's breath, and it's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My leg is throbbing, and I'm shaking all over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone hears my screams and comes running. They're yelling at the dog, trying to get it off me. I'm crying and begging for help. The pain is overwhelming, and I feel so ashamed that I couldn't defend myself.",
    "Therapist: How are your feelings changing?",
    "Client: The fear is still there, but now I'm also feeling angry. Angry at the dog, at myself for being so weak. My SUDS is still at a 9.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog finally lets go, and I collapse to the ground. I'm sobbing uncontrollably, and my leg is bleeding badly. People are gathering around, asking if I'm okay, but I can't speak. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8. I'm still shaking, but the immediate panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does the memory continue?",
    "Client: Someone calls an ambulance. I'm lying there, feeling exposed and vulnerable. The pain is intense, but the fear of it happening again is even worse. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's hovering around a 7 now. I'm feeling drained, both emotionally and physically.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're processing a lot. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: As the paramedics arrive, I start to feel a bit safer. But I'm also embarrassed about all the attention. I can hear people whispering, and I feel like they're judging me for not being able to fend off the dog.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 6. The fear is less intense, but now I'm feeling really sad and vulnerable. It's like this event exposed all my weaknesses.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Remember, you survived a traumatic event.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess... As they're loading me into the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of my parents running towards me. Seeing them makes me feel like a child again, and I start crying all over. I'm relieved they're there, but also ashamed that I need them like this.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as we near the end of this memory?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling exhausted, but also a bit relieved that it's over. There's this lingering anxiety though, like I'm always on edge now, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. Let's start to bring you back to the present."
