    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? Watching that video of the police brutality incident... it brought back all those memories of when I lost my brother. The helplessness, the anger, the fear... it's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Rage. Pure, unadulterated rage. My hands are shaking, and I can feel this heat rising in my chest. It's like... how can this keep happening? How many more lives need to be lost before something changes? I keep seeing my brother's face, imagining him in that situation, and it's tearing me apart.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are accompanying this rage?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. It's not right.\" I'm a professional, I've worked hard to get where I am, but at the end of the day, does it even matter? In their eyes, I'm just another Black man who could be the next victim. It's exhausting, you know? Always being on edge, always wondering if today's the day something happens to me or someone I love.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experience of losing your brother?",
    "Client: It's... it's like reliving that loss all over again. Every time I see another incident, it's like losing him again. I remember getting that call, the disbelief, the numbness... and then the crushing realization that he's gone. And now, seeing these videos, it's like I can't escape that pain. It's a constant reminder that we're still not safe, that what happened to him could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. My jaw is clenched so hard it hurts. There's this... this heaviness in my limbs, like I'm carrying this immense weight. And yet, at the same time, I feel this restless energy, like I need to do something, anything, to make it stop.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's eerily similar. When I first heard about my brother, I felt this same tightness, this same heaviness. But back then, there was also this sense of unreality, like I was watching everything happen from outside my body. Now, it feels more... immediate. More raw. Like I'm fully present in my body, feeling every ounce of this pain and anger.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm doing better than I used to. Before, I'd try to numb these feelings with alcohol or just shut down completely. Now, I'm at least able to sit with them, to talk about them. It's still incredibly painful, but... I don't feel as overwhelmed by it. There's a part of me that recognizes these feelings will pass, even if they feel unbearable right now.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How else has your response changed?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to channel some of this anger into action. I've been getting more involved in community organizations, speaking out about these issues. It doesn't take away the pain or fear, but it gives me a sense of purpose. Like maybe, in some small way, I can help prevent other families from experiencing what mine did.",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of purpose affect your healing process?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. On one hand, it gives me hope, a reason to keep going. It feels like I'm honoring my brother's memory. But on the other hand, it's exhausting. Sometimes I wonder if I'm using it as a way to avoid fully processing my grief. And there are days when it all feels so futile, like nothing will ever change.",
    "Therapist: What helps you push through those difficult days?",
    "Client: My partner, mostly. She's been my rock through all of this. And... and therapy, honestly. Being able to talk about these feelings, to process them in a safe space, it's been crucial. There are also moments... small moments of joy or peace that I cling to. A sunset, a child's laughter, a good meal with friends. They remind me that there's still beauty in the world, even amidst all this pain.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences shaping your future?",
    "Client: I think... I think they've made me more resilient, in a way. More determined. I don't want my brother's death, or any of these deaths, to be in vain. I want to be part of the change, to help create a world where people don't have to live in fear. But it's also made me more aware of the importance of self-care, of finding balance. I can't pour from an empty cup, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. As we wrap up, how are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some important work. The anger and pain are still there, but they feel... more manageable. Less overwhelming. And there's a glimmer of hope there too. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. We'll continue to work through this together."
