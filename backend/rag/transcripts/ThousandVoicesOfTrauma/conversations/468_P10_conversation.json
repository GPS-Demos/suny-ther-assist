    "Therapist: Welcome, let's begin today's imaginal exposure session. How are you feeling about revisiting the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My heart's already racing a bit. But I know this is important, so I'm trying to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* It's early morning, and I'm in my dorm room. The air feels heavy, like something's off. I can hear the wind picking up outside, whistling through the trees.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: My room's a mess, typical student life. Textbooks everywhere, half-eaten pizza from last night. The news is on in the background, but I'm not really paying attention. Suddenly, there's this loud emergency alert on my phone. It's... it's saying there's a severe cyclone warning.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My stomach drops. I can feel my hands getting clammy. I'm frozen for a second, just staring at my phone screen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The wind outside is getting louder. I rush to the window and... oh god, the sky is so dark. It's like night in the middle of the day. Trees are bending sideways. I can see debris flying around.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm panicking. I don't know what to do. Should I leave? Stay put? I'm alone, and I'm scared. I try calling my parents, but the lines are jammed. The power flickers, and then it's gone. It's so quiet without the hum of electronics, but the wind is deafening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Right. So, I decide to head to the basement. As I'm grabbing some supplies, there's this massive crack. I look out the window again, and... oh my god, a huge tree just came down across the street. It crushed a car. I can hear people screaming now.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm running. Down the stairs, two at a time. My heart's pounding so hard I can barely breathe. I make it to the basement, and there are a few other students there. We're all wide-eyed, terrified. The building is shaking. It sounds like the world is ending above us.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My teeth are chattering. I feel cold, but I'm sweating. Someone's crying in the corner. I want to comfort them, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're huddled together in the dark. Hours pass, I think. It's hard to tell. The noise is constant - wind, things breaking, creaking. At one point, there's a huge boom. Someone says it sounded like the roof coming off. I... I start to cry. I've never felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. Eventually, the noise starts to die down. We're all exhausted, but too scared to sleep. When it finally gets quiet, nobody moves for a long time. We're afraid it might start up again.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: Someone's phone still has a bit of battery. We check for updates. The cyclone has passed, but the damage... it's catastrophic. We slowly make our way upstairs. The hallways are flooded, there's glass everywhere. When we get outside... *voice breaks* It's like a war zone. Buildings are just... gone. Cars overturned. Trees everywhere.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb. Shocked. I can't believe what I'm seeing. It doesn't feel real. People are wandering around, dazed. Some are injured. I see a group of police officers trying to coordinate rescue efforts, but they look overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start helping. Moving debris, checking on people. It's automatic, like I'm on autopilot. But every now and then, I catch a glimpse of something that snaps me back - a toy in the rubble, a family photo. It hits me how many lives have been upended.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your anxiety level?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe a 7 now. But focusing on helping others... it's grounding me a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue.",
    "Client: As the day goes on, more help arrives. Emergency services, volunteers. But it's chaos. I overhear arguments, people frustrated with the slow response. There's a moment where I see a police officer get into a heated exchange with a man who's desperate to find his family. It... it almost comes to blows.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Scared. I understand both sides. The police are doing their best, but it's not enough. People are suffering. I want to step in, but I don't know how to help.",
    "Therapist: It's a complex situation. What do you do?",
    "Client: I keep my head down, keep helping where I can. But that moment sticks with me. It's like... even in a disaster, when we should all be working together, there's still this tension, this potential for violence.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your feelings about police now?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I saw them trying to help, but also saw how quickly things could escalate. It made me realize how fragile order is, how easily things can break down. And in those moments, the people with power... it's scary how much impact their actions can have.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound observation. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally and physically. My SUDS is probably down to a 5, but I feel... heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after revisiting such an intense experience. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, yeah. I see... the clock on the wall, your desk, the plant in the corner, the bookshelf, and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, how do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. I didn't realize how much I'd tensed up. My breathing is a bit fast, but it's slowing down now that I'm focusing on it.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* That helps. I feel a bit more centered now.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I think it helped. Talking through it, I realized some things I hadn't before. About how the disaster affected my view of authority, of community. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. Remember, processing takes time. Do you have any questions or concerns?",
    "Client: I'm a bit worried about how I'll feel later. This brought up a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember the coping strategies we've discussed. If you feel overwhelmed, use your grounding techniques. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.",
    "Client: Okay, I will. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue working through this. For now, take care of yourself. Our time is up, but I'm proud of the work you did today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It means a lot to hear that. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. Goodbye."
