    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about three years ago. I had just moved to a new city for work and was feeling pretty lonely. I met this group at a local community center. They seemed so friendly and welcoming at first. They invited me to their meetings, which started out innocuous enough. But gradually, things started to change...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The leader, Mark, began to exert more control over our lives. He'd tell us what to eat, when to sleep, even who we could talk to. I remember one particular night when he called a special meeting. We all gathered in this dimly lit room, and he announced that we needed to \"purify\" ourselves...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What happened next?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He... he made us drink this concoction. Said it would cleanse our souls. I was terrified, but everyone else was doing it. I felt so much pressure. My hands were shaking as I took the cup...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The liquid tasted bitter and made me feel dizzy. Some people started crying, others were laughing hysterically. I felt like I was losing control of my body and mind. I wanted to leave, but I was too scared of what Mark might do...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours passed, and I was in and out of consciousness. When I finally came to, I felt... violated. Like my mind had been invaded. I saw others around me, still out of it. That's when I knew I had to get out. But I was so ashamed. How could I have let this happen to me?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I snuck out that night and never went back. But the guilt and fear stayed with me. I was constantly looking over my shoulder, worried they'd come after me. I couldn't sleep, couldn't focus at work. It took me months before I could even tell anyone what had happened...",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My heart's racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But also... relieved? Like I'm finally facing it instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to believe I fell for their manipulation. I was always proud of being independent and strong-minded. But they caught me at such a vulnerable time...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Cults are skilled at manipulation.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's still a struggle. Sometimes I have nightmares about being back there, unable to escape. And I find it hard to trust new people or groups now.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are understandable. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I've been trying to reconnect with old friends and family. It helps to be around people who knew me before all this. And I've started volunteering at a local animal shelter. Something about helping those animals... it makes me feel like I'm regaining control, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You're taking positive steps.",
    "Client: Yeah, it helps. But there are still days when the memories hit me hard. Like when I smell certain incense or hear chanting music. It can send me right back to that room...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those reactions. They'll lessen over time.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to move past this, to not let it define me. But it's hard when it feels like it's changed so much about who I am and how I see the world.",
    "Therapist: You're already showing resilience by confronting this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I am, aren't I? It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully trust myself again. If I'll ever stop second-guessing my decisions.",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. We'll work on rebuilding that trust.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I've kept it bottled up for so long, afraid of being judged. But here, I feel... I don't know, safer I guess?",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel safe here. That's important.",
    "Client: It is. I think that's why I've avoided relationships for so long after this happened. The idea of being vulnerable with someone again was terrifying. But recently, I've started seeing someone...",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Scary, but good. I'm taking it slow, being honest about my past. They've been really understanding. It's helping me see that not everyone is out to manipulate or control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step forward. Well done.",
