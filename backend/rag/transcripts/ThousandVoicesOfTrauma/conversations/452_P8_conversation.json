    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. The memory of the cyclone, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the wind howling, you know? It's like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel... scared, I guess. Like I'm back there, huddled in the corner of our house, not knowing if we'd make it through the night. The walls were shaking, and I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep wanting to look around the room, to make sure everything's secure. It's silly, I know we're safe here, but... I can't shake this feeling of danger.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How unprepared we were. And then... guilt. So many people lost everything, and here I am, safe in Australia. Sometimes I wonder why I survived when others didn't. It doesn't seem fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you now?",
    "Client: They make me feel... I don't know, disconnected? Like I don't deserve to be here, studying, living a normal life. Sometimes I catch myself holding back from enjoying things because it feels wrong. And then there's this constant worry about when the next disaster might strike.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does reliving this memory affect your current anxiety?",
    "Client: It definitely makes it worse. I find myself constantly checking weather reports, even here where severe cyclones are rare. I struggle to sleep when it's windy outside. It's like my body is always on high alert, waiting for the next catastrophe.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping now compared to then?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm stronger than I realized. Back then, I felt completely powerless. But now, even though reliving it is terrifying, I'm able to talk about it. That's something, right? And I'm learning more about cyclones, about preparation. It helps a little, knowing more.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else has changed for you?",
    "Client: I've become more appreciative of the little things, I suppose. A calm day, a safe home... they mean so much more now. And I feel a stronger connection to my family and my culture. We went through this together, and it's brought us closer in a way.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these changes shaping your future?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I want to use this experience somehow, you know? Maybe to help other refugees, or work in disaster relief. But there's still this part of me that's scared to commit to anything long-term. It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to move forward despite that fear?",
    "Client: It would be... liberating, I think. To not let the cyclone control my life anymore. To use what I've learned to make a difference. But it's scary. What if I'm not strong enough? What if something like that happens again?",
    "Therapist: How might you respond differently if it did?",
    "Client: I... I'd like to think I'd be calmer, more prepared. I know so much more now about what to do in a disaster. And I've learned coping strategies here in therapy. Maybe I could even help others stay calm. It's a nice thought, but... it still feels overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What support do you think you'd need?",
    "Client: I'd need my family, definitely. And... maybe a support group of other survivors? People who understand. I think having a plan in place would help too, like knowing exactly what to do if another disaster strikes. And... continuing therapy, I suppose. It helps to have someone to talk to about all this.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that support make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, actually. Like I'm not alone in this. It makes the idea of facing another disaster less terrifying. Still scary, but... manageable, maybe? It's a strange feeling, like I'm both vulnerable and strong at the same time.",
    "Therapist: What does that mix of vulnerability and strength mean to you?",
    "Client: I guess it means... I'm human? That it's okay to be scared, but also that I have the capacity to face my fears. It's like... the cyclone showed me how fragile life can be, but also how resilient we are. Maybe I don't have to be either strong or weak. Maybe I can be both.",
    "Therapist: How might embracing both aspects affect your healing?",
    "Client: I think... it might make it easier to be gentle with myself. To acknowledge the pain and fear without letting it define me. And maybe it would help me connect more with others, knowing we all have our vulnerabilities and strengths. It's a lot to process, but... it feels right, somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take with this new perspective?",
    "Client: I could... maybe reach out to other students from my home country? Share our experiences, our fears, our hopes. It's scary to open up, but... it might help to know I'm not alone in this. And maybe I could offer support to someone else who's struggling. That feels like a good place to start.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... tired, honestly. But also a bit lighter? Like I've put down a heavy load I didn't even realize I was carrying. It's still there, but... it feels more manageable now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to balance moving forward with honoring what happened. And maybe we could talk more about practical steps for managing my anxiety, especially when the weather turns bad. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick up there next session. Take care."
