    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that awful plane crash... it's making my stomach churn. I've been having more nightmares lately, too. I'm not sure if I can do this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your anxiety is normal. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... every time I think about that day, I feel like I'm right back there. The screaming, the chaos, the smell of fuel... it's overwhelming. I've spent so long trying to forget it all. Why do we need to bring it up again? Isn't that counterproductive?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let me explain why we're doing this.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I'm still not sure about this whole thing. It feels like we're opening Pandora's box, you know?",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: But how? I mean, I've been trying to avoid thinking about it for so long. How is deliberately remembering it going to help? Won't it just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can change how your brain processes it. It may be difficult at first, but it gets easier.",
    "Client: I see... I guess that makes some sense. But what if I completely fall apart during the session? What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause or stop anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's... that's reassuring. I appreciate that. I'm still scared, but knowing you'll be here helps. Can you tell me more about what to expect? What exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it in present tense, focusing on sensory details and emotions.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm worried about feeling too vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Eyes closed can help, but it's not required. We'll find what works for you.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I might try with my eyes open at first, if that's alright. Um, how long will this take? The whole process, I mean.",
    "Therapist: We'll do multiple sessions, each about 30-45 minutes. Progress is gradual but consistent.",
    "Client: Multiple sessions... I see. That's a relief, actually. I was worried we'd have to get through it all at once. So, what happens after each session? Will I be okay to drive home, or should I arrange for someone to pick me up?",
    "Therapist: It's best to have support after. How about we discuss post-session care?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. My husband has been so supportive through all of this. Maybe I could ask him to come pick me up after these sessions. I just... I want to make sure I'm doing this right. I want to get better, for myself and for my family.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Your commitment is admirable. Shall we start planning for next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Well, as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for explaining everything and being so patient with my questions. It means a lot to have this kind of support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. Let's schedule our next meeting."
