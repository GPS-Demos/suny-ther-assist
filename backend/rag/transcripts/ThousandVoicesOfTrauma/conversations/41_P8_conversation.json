    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there in that hospital room, you know? My heart's racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's not as intense as it was during the actual hostage situation, but it's... it's unsettling.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was just there to visit my colleague, and suddenly... everything changed. The smell of antiseptic is so vivid in my memory, and I can hear the panicked voices of the nurses. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here. Not in a place that's supposed to be safe.\" It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: And how does your body feel as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: My hands are a bit clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel... tense, like I need to be ready to react at any moment. It's exhausting, really. I can feel my shoulders hunching up, almost like I'm trying to make myself smaller, less visible. Just like I did that day.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. But also... anger. I'm angry that someone could do this, could threaten people who were already vulnerable. And there's guilt too. I survived, but others were hurt. I keep wondering if I could have done more, you know? And then there's this overwhelming sadness. It's like... like the world became a different place after that day.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Back then, it was like being hit by a tidal wave. Now, it's more like... like standing in the surf. The waves still come, but I'm not completely overwhelmed. But it's still hard. I still have moments where I feel like I can't breathe, where I'm right back in that room.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're handling it now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I think I'm more aware of what's happening. Before, the feelings would just wash over me, and I'd feel lost. Now, I can recognize them. I can say, \"Okay, this is anxiety,\" or \"This is a flashback.\" It doesn't make it go away, but it helps me feel a bit more in control. And I'm trying to use some of the techniques we've discussed, like grounding myself in the present.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... that I'm stronger than I thought. Each time we do this, it's hard, but I get through it. And I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this whole thing. It's like... like I'm reclaiming pieces of myself that I thought were lost. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. And that's not a feeling I've had much of lately. It's like a tiny spark in all this darkness. But it's there, and it's real. And I want to hold onto it, you know? I want to believe that I can move past this, that I can feel safe again. It's scary to hope, but... but I think I need to.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this spark of hope?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's partly these sessions. Being able to talk about it, to face it head-on instead of trying to avoid it. And it's partly realizing that I'm not alone in this. My family, my friends... they've been so supportive. And you... you've helped me see that what I'm feeling is normal, that it's okay to struggle with this. It's like... like I'm starting to see a path forward, even if it's still a bit hazy.",
    "Therapist: How might this hope influence your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me start doing things again. I've been so isolated, so afraid to go out. But maybe I can start small, you know? Maybe I can meet a friend for coffee, or go for a walk in the park. It's terrifying to think about, but also... exciting? Like I'm taking back control of my life, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's coming up for you as you consider this?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's fear, definitely. What if I have a panic attack in public? What if I can't handle it? But there's also this... determination. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to be able to visit my grandkids without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to be able to go to the hospital if I need to without falling apart. It's like... like I'm ready to fight back, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that fighting spirit feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's energizing. My heart's still racing, but it feels different now. Less panicky, more... determined? My hands aren't as clammy, and I feel like I'm sitting up straighter. It's like there's this warmth in my chest, spreading outward. It's not comfortable, exactly, but it feels... right. Like this is how I'm supposed to feel.",
    "Therapist: What does this tell you about your capacity to heal?",
    "Client: I think... I think it tells me that I'm stronger than I've been giving myself credit for. That maybe, just maybe, I can do this. It's not going to be easy, and I know there will be setbacks. But for the first time in a long while, I feel like I might be able to overcome this. It's scary, but... but also exciting. Like I'm on the verge of something important.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you want to carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to... to keep pushing myself. Gently, but consistently. Maybe I can start by making a list of things I want to do again, places I want to go. And then tackle them one by one, at my own pace. And I want to keep talking about it, keep facing it head-on. It's hard, but I think it's helping. I don't want to be defined by what happened anymore. I want to be defined by how I overcame it.",
    "Therapist: That's an inspiring goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way. Like I've accomplished something important. There's still fear and anxiety, but it's not as overwhelming. It's like... like I can see beyond it now. I feel more grounded, more present. And there's this sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe, just maybe, things can get better. It's a small feeling, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on some specific coping strategies for when I'm out in public. Maybe we could talk about how to handle flashbacks or panic attacks if they happen when I'm trying to do normal things again? And... and maybe we could talk more about how to communicate what I'm going through to my family. They want to help, but sometimes I don't know how to explain what I'm feeling.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll pick up there next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... but I think it was important. I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You did great. Take care of yourself this week."
