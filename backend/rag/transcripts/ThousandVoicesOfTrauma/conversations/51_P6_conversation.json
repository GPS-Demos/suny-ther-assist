    "Therapist: Alright, John, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the medical trauma you experienced as a refugee. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in a makeshift clinic. It's hot, stuffy. The smell of antiseptic is overwhelming. I can hear people groaning in pain around me. My leg... it's throbbing. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening.\"",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor, if you can call him that, he's rushing. His hands are shaking. I'm lying on a hard surface, maybe a table? He's examining my leg, and I can see the worry in his eyes. The pain is getting worse, and I'm starting to panic.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7? My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's telling me he needs to set the bone. There's no anesthesia. I'm terrified. I can feel sweat dripping down my face. The sound of my own rapid breathing is all I can hear. Then... then he starts to pull my leg. The pain... it's excruciating. I'm screaming, but it's like I can't hear myself. Everything's a blur of agony and fear.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. God, it feels so real. My leg is aching right now, and my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel this way. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The bone snaps into place. The pain is blinding. I think I passed out for a moment. When I come to, the doctor is wrapping my leg. He looks exhausted, relieved. I'm crying, shaking uncontrollably. The relief that it's over is overwhelming, but so is the fear of what comes next. How will I survive as a refugee with a broken leg?",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 6? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's common. You've faced this memory. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my leg. But I'm starting to relax a bit. My breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a moment. What are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I survived that. It was horrible, but I got through it. I'm here now, talking about it. That feels... significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: It is. You've shown incredible strength. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I feel... tired, but okay.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end here for today. You did excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but... I think it helped. I feel like I understand that experience better now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue this work in our next session."
