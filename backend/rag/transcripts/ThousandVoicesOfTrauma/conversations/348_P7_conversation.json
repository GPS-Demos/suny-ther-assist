    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Are you ready to revisit the memory we discussed?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in the refugee camp. It's crowded, and there's a constant buzz of voices. I can smell the dust and sweat. I'm walking with my younger sister to get water when suddenly I hear shouting. Two men are arguing loudly, their voices getting angrier by the second. My sister grips my hand tighter, and I can feel her trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The argument escalates quickly. One man pushes the other, and before I know it, they're throwing punches. People around us start yelling, some trying to intervene, others backing away. I'm frozen in place, my sister hiding behind me. The fight is getting more violent, and I can see blood on one man's face.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright. As the fight gets worse, more people join in. It's chaos. I can hear women screaming, children crying. Someone pushes past us, knocking my sister to the ground. I try to help her up, but there are too many people rushing around us. I'm terrified we'll be trampled.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crack. At first, I think it's something falling, but then I realize... it's a gunshot. Everyone starts running. I grab my sister and we run too, but I don't know where we're going. People are pushing and shoving, and I can barely breathe. I hear more gunshots behind us.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, it's just a memory now.",
    "Client: We keep running until we reach our family's tent. My mother is there, frantic with worry. She hugs us tightly, and I can feel her heart pounding. We can still hear shouting and gunshots in the distance. My sister is crying, and I'm trying to be strong, but I'm shaking all over. I've never felt so helpless and scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The rest of that day is a blur. We stayed in our tent, afraid to go out. I remember feeling angry that even in a place where we were supposed to be safe, violence could erupt so easily. I felt like we'd never truly be safe again.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My hands are shaking, and I feel a bit nauseous. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like a weight has been lifted somewhat.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but I think it helped to talk about it in detail. I've never really done that before.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. (Takes a deep breath) I'm starting to feel a bit calmer now. It's strange, but revisiting the memory... it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",

    "Client: Thank you. I'm glad I did this, even though it was difficult. I think I'm ready to end the session now.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll discuss this further next time."
