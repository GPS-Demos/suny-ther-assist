    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Abadi. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. Last week was intense, and I'm not sure I'm ready to dive back in. But I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's proceed.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing outside the hospital. It's a warm day, unusually so for March. I can feel the sun on my face, but I'm shivering. There's a crowd gathering near the entrance.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: I see... I see police officers. They're shouting at someone. A young man, he looks scared. He's holding his hands up, but they're advancing on him. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I feel tense, like I can't look away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The young man, he's backing away. He trips and falls. The officers, they're on him in seconds. I hear him cry out. I... I want to help, but I'm frozen. Oh God, they're hitting him. Why are they hitting him?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: More people are shouting now. Someone's filming with their phone. The young man, he's not moving anymore. I see blood. There's blood on the pavement. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I can't... I can't watch this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I step forward. My legs are shaking. I shout, \"Stop! You're killing him!\" But they don't listen. One officer turns to me, his face twisted in anger. I've never seen such hate in someone's eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How does that feel?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. But I can't stay silent. Not when... not when this is happening right in front of me.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer, he's coming towards me now. His hand is on his taser. I hear someone scream - I think it's me. I stumble backwards, nearly falling. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. Just like that young man. Oh God, is this how he felt? I... I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there. The officer, he's right in front of me now. He's shouting, telling me to back off. But I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I've never been so scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I manage to find my voice. I tell him, \"I'm a witness. I saw everything.\" My voice is shaking, but I force the words out. He hesitates, then backs away. I look past him, to the young man on the ground. Paramedics are arriving now. It's... it's chaos.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Angry. Terrified. Guilty. I should have done more. I should have intervened sooner. Maybe if I had...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for their actions.",
    "Client: I know, but... *sigh* I can't shake this feeling. The crowd is dispersing now. The young man is being loaded into an ambulance. There's so much blood. I feel lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I sit down on the curb. My legs won't hold me anymore. A woman approaches me, asks if I'm okay. I can't speak. I just shake my head. She sits with me, holds my hand. I'm trembling all over.",
    "Therapist: That sounds comforting. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's grounding. Her hand is warm. It reminds me I'm still here, still alive. But my mind keeps replaying what I saw. The violence, the blood, the fear in that young man's eyes.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Police start taking statements. I give mine, my voice barely above a whisper. I tell them everything I saw. The officer who threatened me is nowhere to be seen. I feel... I feel numb.",
    "Therapist: How does giving your statement make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. What if they come after me? But also... determined. Someone needs to speak up. If not me, then who?",
    "Therapist: That's very brave of you. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I call my husband. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. When I hear his voice, I break down. I'm sobbing, trying to explain what happened. He says he's coming to get me.",
    "Therapist: How does talking to your husband make you feel?",
    "Client: Safe. Like maybe everything will be okay. But I can't shake the images from my mind. The young man's face, the blood, the officer's angry eyes. They're all swirling together.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7. I'm still shaken, but talking about it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. What happens when your husband arrives?",
    "Client: He... he pulls up in our car. When I see him, I just... I collapse into his arms. I'm crying again. He holds me, strokes my hair. He doesn't ask questions, just lets me cry. I feel safer, but I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How does being with your husband change how you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting. But I also feel guilty. Here I am, safe in my husband's arms, while that young man... I don't even know if he survived. The guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did what you could. How does the scene end?",
    "Client: We... we drive home. The car is silent. I can't speak, can't explain what I saw. My husband keeps glancing at me, worried. When we get home, I go straight to the bathroom and throw up. The stress, the fear, it all comes out.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How do you feel now, remembering all this?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. Angry. It's all mixed up. I can still see it all so clearly, like it happened yesterday. I... I don't know how to move past this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. Talking about it, reliving it... it's hard, but it does help. I feel less overwhelmed than when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel physically now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still tense. My shoulders are tight, and my stomach is in knots. But I'm breathing easier. The shaking has mostly stopped.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I feel a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've shared some of the burden. It's still there, but it feels... manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. We'll end here for today. Well done."
