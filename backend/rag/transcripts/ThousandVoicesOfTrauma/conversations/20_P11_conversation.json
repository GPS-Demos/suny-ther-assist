    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, James?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? I could hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking... I could even smell the alcohol on his breath. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I was just a kid, watching my neighbor beat his wife. I wanted to do something, anything, but I was frozen. I keep thinking, maybe if I'd called for help or... I don't know. It's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness connect to your life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess it's why I have such a hard time with confrontation. Even in my classes, if there's a group project and someone's not pulling their weight, I can't bring myself to speak up. It's like I'm that scared kid again, afraid to make things worse.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I felt this tightness in my chest, like I couldn't breathe properly. And my hands... they were so sweaty. It's funny, I never realized how physical these memories are until now.",
    "Therapist: How do these physical reactions impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... they're exhausting. Sometimes I'll be walking down the street and hear raised voices, and suddenly I'm in fight-or-flight mode. It makes it hard to concentrate on my studies or even enjoy simple things. I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What strategies have helped you cope?",
    "Client: Well, the breathing exercises we've practiced have been helpful. And... I've been trying to remind myself that I'm safe now, that I'm not that helpless kid anymore. It's hard, but it does help sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad those are helping. What else came up for you today?",
    "Client: I... I realized something. The man who was beating his wife, he looked so out of control. But I've been controlling every aspect of my life since then. It's like I'm trying to make up for that moment of helplessness by never letting anything be out of my control again.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does this realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. Like maybe I can start to let go a little. I've been so tense for so long, always trying to predict and prevent bad things from happening. But I can't control everything, can I?",
    "Therapist: No, we can't. How might letting go of some control benefit you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it could help me relax more. Maybe even open up to people. I've been so closed off, afraid of getting hurt or seeing others get hurt. But that's no way to live, is it? I want to have relationships, to trust people again.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. Each time, it gets a little easier to face the memories. And talking about it afterwards like this, it helps me make sense of things. I'm... I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of your commitment, James. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I realized. I've been carrying this burden for so long, but I'm still here, still fighting. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to let some of that burden go.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think that's enough for today. It's a lot to process, but I feel... I don't know, lighter somehow. Like maybe there's hope, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's great, James. Remember to use your coping strategies this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week, James. Take care."
