    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about... you know, the incident.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about today's session.",
    "Client: Okay... What exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something called imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not sure I fully get it.",
    "Therapist: It's a way to process your trauma memory. We'll go through it step-by-step.",
    "Client: Process the memory? You mean... I have to relive it? I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: But what if I panic? Or what if I can't stop crying? I'm scared of losing control.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you. But can you tell me more about what to expect? Like, what am I supposed to do exactly?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail. I'll guide you with questions.",
    "Client: In detail? God, that sounds terrifying. Will this really help? I've been trying so hard to forget everything.",
    "Therapist: Avoiding memories often increases PTSD symptoms. This helps process them.",
    "Client: I see... It's just... I've never talked about it in detail before. Not even to my family or close friends. It feels so raw still.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a big step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to be brave, but it's hard. How long will this take? And will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: Today's session will last about an hour. We'll do this weekly.",
    "Client: An hour? That seems like a long time to be talking about... that. Will I be okay afterward? I have classes later.",
    "Therapist: We'll end with grounding exercises. You might feel drained, so rest after.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try to clear my schedule after this. Um, is it okay if I bring a comfort object next time? Like, maybe my favorite scarf?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Whatever helps you feel safe and grounded.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I think I'm ready to try this. It's scary, but if you think it'll help... I want to get better. I'm tired of feeling so afraid all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. And thank you, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start. Remember, we're in this together."
