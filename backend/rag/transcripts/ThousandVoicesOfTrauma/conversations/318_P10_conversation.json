    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 or 5 right now. Just thinking about it makes me a bit anxious.",
    "Therapist: Noted. Remember, we can pause anytime. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in my dorm room. It's a Friday afternoon, and I'm video chatting with Maria. We've been dating for almost two years now, but she's back home in Colombia for the semester. I can see her face on the screen, and she looks... serious. My stomach's already in knots.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: She's talking, but I can barely focus. I catch phrases like \"long-distance is too hard\" and \"we're growing apart.\" My heart's racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I want to argue, to fight for us, but the words won't come out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7 now. God, this hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally manage to speak, but my voice sounds strange, almost pleading. I'm saying, \"We can make this work, Maria. Please, let's just try.\" But I can see in her eyes... she's already made up her mind. The room feels like it's spinning.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... okay. Maria's saying something about staying friends, but it feels like a punch to the gut. I'm nodding, but inside, I'm screaming. This can't be happening. Two years, gone just like that.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight. It's hard to breathe. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous. I want to throw my laptop across the room, but I don't. I just sit there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8, maybe even a 9. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The call ends, and I'm just... sitting there. Staring at the blank screen. It's like the world has stopped. I can hear my roommate in the next room, laughing at something. How can everything be normal when my world just fell apart?",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble to my bed and collapse. I'm crying now, ugly sobs that I can't control. My phone keeps buzzing - probably friends asking about weekend plans - but I can't bear to look at it. What if Maria's already changed her relationship status? I feel so alone, so... rejected.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still high... maybe an 8. My chest hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I lay there. Minutes? Hours? The room gets dark. I hear my roommate come in, ask if I'm okay. I pretend to be asleep. I can't face anyone right now. My mind keeps replaying every moment with Maria, wondering where it all went wrong. Did I not try hard enough? Was I not good enough?",
    "Therapist: These thoughts are normal. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I feel so small. So insignificant. Like, if I can't make this work, what can I do? I've built so much of my life around this relationship, and now it's just... gone. I'm shivering, but I'm also sweating. My head is pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, releasing something?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally check my phone. There's a message from Maria. She's sorry, she hopes I understand. I want to be angry, but I just feel... empty. Hollow. I drag myself to the bathroom, splash water on my face. The guy in the mirror looks like a stranger - red eyes, pale face. Is this really me?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking I don't know who I am without her. We had all these plans, you know? Graduation, moving in together, maybe even going back to Colombia. Now what? I feel so lost, so... untethered.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I grab my keys and just start walking. It's late, the campus is quiet. There's a slight drizzle, but I barely notice. I end up at the lake, just staring at the water. Part of me wants to scream, to throw rocks, to do something. But I just stand there, feeling the rain get heavier.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Cold. Numb. My clothes are getting soaked, but I don't care. It's like... like the rain is washing away everything. My plans, my dreams, my identity. I'm shivering, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. The physical discomfort is almost... grounding, in a way.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I stand there. Eventually, I hear someone calling my name. It's my roommate, looking worried. He's brought an umbrella, drapes his jacket over my shoulders. I want to explain, but I can't find the words. He doesn't push, just stands there with me.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful, I guess. And... less alone. We walk back to the dorm in silence. By the time we get back, I'm exhausted. Emotionally, physically... just drained.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens when you get back?",
    "Client: I take a hot shower, change into dry clothes. My roommate makes some tea, asks if I want to talk. I shake my head, but... I appreciate the gesture. I curl up in bed, clutching my phone, half hoping Maria will call and say it was all a mistake.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Broken. Lost. But also... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit relieved? Like, the worst has happened, and I'm still here. Still breathing. It hurts like hell, but... I'm surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking through it... it's helping. It still hurts, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. It's strange, reliving it all. But it also feels like... like I'm looking at it from a different perspective now. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's part of the process. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* Yeah, I feel more... present now. It's like, I can separate myself from that moment a bit more.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How would you like to conclude today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to just sit quietly for a minute. Process everything we've talked about. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: *sits in silence for a few moments* Thank you. This was tough, but... I think it was good. I feel a bit lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I think I'm ready for that. Thanks, doc.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
