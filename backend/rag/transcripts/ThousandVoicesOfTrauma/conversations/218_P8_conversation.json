    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. I can still see my sister's face so clearly in my mind, the way she looked when she told me she was leaving to join that group. I didn't realize how much that memory still affected me.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how I could have stopped her. Maybe if I had said something different, or if I had tried harder to convince her... I feel so guilty. And angry too, I guess. Angry at the people who took her away, angry at myself for not doing more. It's like this heavy weight in my chest.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like there's this burning sensation in my stomach that's spreading up to my chest. My hands are clenched, and I notice I'm gritting my teeth. It's almost like I want to lash out at something, you know? But at the same time, I feel so helpless. Like no matter what I do, I can't change what happened.",
    "Therapist: What's the most difficult part of this memory for you?",
    "Client: The most difficult part is... is remembering the hope in her eyes. She really believed she was going to find something better, something meaningful. And I couldn't make her see that she already had that with us, with her family. I keep replaying that moment, seeing her smile as she told me about this new \"family\" she'd found. God, I was so naive. I should have known something was wrong.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory impact your current feelings about your sister?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me still loves her so much, misses her every day. But there's also this resentment that I can't shake. Like, how could she do this to us? To me? We were so close, and she just... left. And now, thinking about it, I realize I'm also scared. Scared that she's suffering, or that she's completely changed and I wouldn't even recognize her anymore if I saw her.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about these feelings?",
    "Client: I notice that they're... intense. Like, really intense. It's almost overwhelming how many emotions I'm feeling all at once. Sadness, anger, fear, guilt - they're all mixed up together. And it's not just emotional, it's physical too. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my throat, like I might cry at any moment. It's exhausting, honestly.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're different, I think. When it first happened, I was in shock. I couldn't really process it. Now, it's like everything is sharper, more defined. The guilt is definitely stronger now. Back then, I was just confused and hurt. Now, I understand more about cults and how they operate, and that knowledge makes me feel even worse for not recognizing the signs.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this tells you about your healing process?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe that I'm finally starting to really face what happened? It hurts more now, but maybe that's because I'm actually dealing with it instead of trying to push it away. It's like... like I'm finally letting myself feel everything I've been avoiding for years. And that's terrifying, but also... maybe necessary? I don't know. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How might this new awareness help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I suppose... it could help me understand my reactions better. Like, now I can see why certain things trigger such strong emotions in me. And maybe... maybe it could help me be more compassionate with myself? I've been so angry at myself for so long, but revisiting this memory, I can see that I was just a kid too, really. I didn't have the knowledge or resources to handle something like that. It doesn't make it hurt less, but maybe it can help me stop blaming myself so much.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need as you process these feelings?",
    "Client: I think... I need patience. From myself, and from others. This is bringing up a lot of stuff I've buried for a long time, and I know it's going to take time to work through it all. I might need help staying grounded when these memories and feelings get overwhelming. And... I think I need to talk about my sister more. I've avoided mentioning her for so long, but maybe sharing more about her, about who she was before all this, could help me hold onto the good memories too, not just the painful ones.",
    "Therapist: How can we incorporate that into our sessions?",
    "Client: Maybe we could... set aside some time each session to talk about a positive memory of my sister? Just to balance out all the heavy stuff we're dealing with. And perhaps we could work on some more grounding techniques for when things get intense. I've found the breathing exercises helpful, but I feel like I need more tools in my toolkit, you know? Oh, and... I think I might be ready to consider reaching out to some support groups for families affected by cults. I've been avoiding that for years, but now... I think it might help to connect with others who understand.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've set down a burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. It's scary to face all of this, but there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe by working through this, I can finally start to move forward. Don't get me wrong, I'm still terrified of what other memories and feelings might come up, but I also feel like I'm finally doing something, you know? Like I'm not just stuck anymore.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve more into the guilt I'm feeling. It's such a dominant emotion, and I feel like it's holding me back in a lot of ways. Maybe we could explore where it's coming from and how to start addressing it? And if we have time, I'd like to talk about some strategies for managing the anxiety that comes up when I think about my sister. It can be really overwhelming sometimes, and I'd like to feel more in control of my reactions.",
    "Therapist: That's a good focus. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we do that grounding exercise again? The one where we focus on things in the room? I'm feeling a bit shaky after all of this, and I think it would help me transition back into the rest of my day. And maybe... could you remind me of some self-care strategies? I have a feeling I'm going to need them this week as I process everything we've talked about today.",
