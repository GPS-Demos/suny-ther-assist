    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my emotions are all jumbled up. I can still see my grandmother's face so clearly, you know? Her kind eyes, the wrinkles around her mouth when she smiled. But then I remember her in the hospital bed, and it's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: There's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't catch my breath properly. And I feel... I don't know, guilty? Like I should have done more, visited more often. But I was so young when she passed, and I didn't really understand what was happening. I just knew she was gone, and suddenly there was this huge hole in my life.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my shoulders. And my stomach feels kind of queasy. I keep thinking about all the times I could have called or visited, but I was too caught up in my own life. And now... now I can never make up for that lost time.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing her voice, you know? Calling me her \"little sunshine.\" God, I haven't thought about that in years. It's like... it's like I'm grieving all over again. But there's also this warmth, this... I don't know, comfort? When I think about the good times we had together. It's just... it's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does remembering those good times feel?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet, I guess. There's this warmth in my chest, like a little flame. But it's also painful because I know we can't make any new memories. I find myself wishing I could just hug her one more time, tell her how much she meant to me. It's... it's making me tear up just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about these emotions?",
    "Client: They're... they're intense. More intense than I expected. It's like they've been bottled up for years, and now they're all rushing out at once. I feel sad, angry, grateful, and guilty all at the same time. It's exhausting, but also... I don't know, maybe a little cathartic? Like I'm finally letting myself feel everything I've been pushing down for so long.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's showing me how much I've avoided dealing with loss. Not just my grandmother, but other losses too. It's like I've been running from these feelings, afraid that if I let them in, they'd overwhelm me. And maybe they are overwhelming, but... but I'm still here, you know? I'm feeling them, and I'm okay. It's hard, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: What's that realization like for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of empowering. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still really difficult. But there's a part of me that feels... stronger? Like, if I can face this, maybe I can face other things too. It's scary, but also... I don't know, hopeful? Like maybe I don't have to keep running anymore.",
    "Therapist: How might this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be more present. Like, instead of always worrying about the future or regretting the past, I could just... be. Appreciate the people in my life while they're here. And maybe... maybe it'll help me open up more. I've always been so guarded, you know? Afraid of getting hurt. But if I can sit with these intense emotions about my grandmother, maybe I can let myself be more vulnerable with others too.",
    "Therapist: What stands out to you most from this experience?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the realization that grief isn't just sadness. It's this whole spectrum of emotions, you know? There's love, and gratitude, and anger, and regret... all mixed up together. And it's okay to feel all of that. It doesn't mean I loved her any less or that I'm a bad person. It just means I'm human, and I cared deeply. That's... that's actually kind of beautiful, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, honestly. Part of me wants to run away and never think about this stuff again. But there's another part that feels... I don't know, ready? Like, now that I've opened this door, I need to see what's on the other side. It's going to be hard, I know that. But I think... I think it might be worth it. To finally process all of this, to maybe find some peace with it. Yeah, I... I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be gentle with myself. Give myself space to feel whatever comes up, without judgment. And maybe... maybe reach out to my friends more? I've always been so independent, but I'm realizing that it's okay to lean on others sometimes. And... and I think I need to keep coming here, keep talking about this stuff. It's hard, but it helps. It really does.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained, you know? But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a burden I didn't even know I was carrying. It's a weird mix of exhaustion and relief. And there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope? Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side. It's scary, but... but I'm ready to try.",
