    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Ramirez?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Thompson. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting those memories of my ex-wife's constant criticism and emotional manipulation... it's like I'm right back there, you know? I can almost hear her voice, see the look of disgust on her face. It's... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... the feeling of helplessness. I keep thinking about this one time when she berated me in front of our grandkids. I was trying to fix a toy for our granddaughter, and I couldn't get it right. My ex-wife just... she just went off on me. Called me useless, incompetent. Said I couldn't do anything right. And the kids were right there, watching. I felt so small, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... tough. Really tough. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. For a moment, I thought I might have a panic attack. But... but I also noticed something. As I was describing it, I started to feel angry. Not just at her, but at myself for allowing it to happen for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I struggle so much with anxiety now. I'm always second-guessing myself, worried about making mistakes. Even simple things, like choosing what to wear or what to eat, can be paralyzing sometimes. I'm constantly afraid of being judged or criticized.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might we use this understanding?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I need to work on rebuilding my self-confidence? I've spent so long believing her words, believing I was worthless. But that's not true, is it? I raised good kids, I had a successful career. I'm not useless.",
    "Therapist: Excellent reflection. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I could... maybe I could start making more decisions for myself in the shared accommodation. Like, offering to cook a meal for everyone once a week. It's small, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How do you feel about continuing these exposures?",
    "Client: It's hard, Dr. Thompson. Really hard. But... I think it's helping. Each time, I feel like I'm understanding myself a little better. It's painful, but... I think I need to keep going. I want to get better.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do that. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work here. I'm just here to support you."
