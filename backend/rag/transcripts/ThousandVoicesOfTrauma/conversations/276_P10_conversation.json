    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the hostage situation, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 40. It's not overwhelming yet, but I can feel the tension building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Just give me a moment to take a deep breath... Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the bank. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm standing in line, waiting to deposit a check from a client. The marble floor is cool beneath my feet, and there's a faint smell of cleaning products in the air. I'm thinking about what to make for dinner when suddenly...",
    "Therapist: Go on. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a loud bang, and someone starts shouting. I spin around, and there are two men in ski masks, waving guns. One of them fires a shot into the ceiling, and plaster rains down. People are screaming, dropping to the floor. I... I can't move. My legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60. My hands are starting to shake.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I slowly lower myself to the ground. My purse falls next to me, and I can hear my phone vibrating inside. It's probably my partner, wondering why I'm late. Oh God, what if I never see them again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with the moment, Maria. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Right, sorry. Um, one of the men is yelling at the tellers to empty the cash drawers. The other one is pacing, keeping an eye on us. He's so close I can smell his sweat and cigarette breath. My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure everyone can hear it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. I keep thinking about my family, about all the things I haven't done yet. I... I don't want to die here.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's up to 75. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel the chair beneath you.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. But in the memory, I'm still on that cold floor. Someone next to me is crying softly. I want to comfort them, but I'm too scared to move. The robbers are getting more agitated. They're shouting at each other now.",
    "Therapist: What are they saying?",
    "Client: I can't make out everything, but one of them is panicking. He's saying something about the police, that they'll be here soon. The other one, he seems calmer, more in control. He's telling everyone to stay down, to keep quiet.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as this is happening?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to make myself as small as possible. My muscles are so tense they're starting to ache. I keep thinking about my family, about how I should have told them I love them this morning. God, what if I never get the chance again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, Maria. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a commotion near the entrance. Someone... someone tried to run. The panicky robber, he... he shoots. The sound is deafening in the enclosed space. There's a scream, then a thud. I can't see what happened, but I know... I know someone's been hurt.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. In the memory, everything's chaos now. People are crying, pleading. The calm robber is furious, yelling at his partner. I can hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. Part of me is relieved, but I'm also terrified of what might happen when the police arrive.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The robbers are arguing now. The panicky one wants to run, but the other one won't let him. He's saying something about hostages, about negotiations. My stomach drops. This isn't going to end quickly.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. It's like I've left my body. I can see everything happening, but it's like I'm watching a movie. Is... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to extreme stress. What do you observe next?",
    "Client: The calm robber is on the phone now, talking to the police. He's making demands, but his voice is shaking. The other one is pacing, gun still in hand. I'm afraid he might shoot again. The person next to me is praying softly in Spanish. I find myself mouthing the words along with them, even though I'm not religious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at 90. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Hours pass. Or maybe it's minutes. Time feels warped. My legs are cramping from staying still so long. The robbers are getting more and more agitated. They keep looking out the windows, arguing in hushed voices. I think... I think they're realizing there's no way out.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared, but also... hopeful? Maybe this will end soon. But then I remember the person who was shot, and I feel guilty for feeling hopeful.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a loud noise outside. The robbers are shouting, panicking. Suddenly, there's smoke everywhere. My eyes are burning, I can't see. There are more loud noises - gunshots? Flashbangs? I don't know. I cover my head with my arms, praying it will be over soon.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Maria. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, this is just a memory. You survived this.",
    "Client: Right... right. Okay. In the chaos, I feel someone grabbing me. For a moment, I think it's one of the robbers, but then I realize it's a police officer. They're pulling me to my feet, guiding me out of the building. The sunlight is blinding after hours in the dim bank.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're being led out?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also... disconnected? Like I can't quite believe it's over. My legs are shaky, and I'm coughing from the smoke. As we get outside, I see ambulances, police cars, a crowd of onlookers. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're almost through it. What happens next?",
    "Client: They sit me down on the curb. A paramedic is checking me over, asking questions, but I can barely focus. I'm scanning the crowd, looking for other hostages, wondering if everyone made it out. That's when I see them bringing out a body bag, and I just... I break down. All the fear, the tension, it all comes pouring out.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. How are you feeling now, Maria?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My SUDS is down to about 70, I think. It's like I've lived through it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Um, okay. I see... the plant in the corner, your desk, the bookshelf, the painting on the wall, and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The chair I'm sitting on, my clothes, my hair, and... the armrest.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The clock ticking, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee and... maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Calmer. My SUDS is down to about 50 now. It's... it's strange. Talking about it is hard, but I also feel like... like I'm starting to process it better?",
    "Therapist: That's often how it works. You've made excellent progress today. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I'm tired, but I also feel a bit lighter, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. You've done great work today, Maria. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. Thank you for guiding me through this. It was tough, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. I'm proud of the work you've done today. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
