    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the incident with the police?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work late one night. It was dark, and I saw police lights flashing ahead. I started to feel nervous, my heart racing. As I got closer, I saw two officers had someone pinned to the ground. They were... they were hitting him. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I wanted to help, but I was scared. The man on the ground was crying out in pain. One of the officers noticed me and started shouting at me to leave. I couldn't move. I felt like I was back in my childhood, helpless, watching my parents fight. The officer approached me, his hand on his weapon. I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My chest felt tight, I couldn't breathe. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move. The officer grabbed my arm roughly, and I flinched. He started questioning me aggressively, asking what I was doing there, if I knew the suspect. I tried to explain I was just walking home, but my voice was shaking so much. I felt so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The other officer joined us, leaving the man on the ground. They both towered over me, their faces stern and intimidating. I could smell the sweat and aggression. My mind kept flashing back to my childhood, feeling trapped and scared. I wanted to cry, to beg them to let me go, but I couldn't speak. I was terrified they would hurt me like they hurt that man.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: They searched me roughly, patting me down and emptying my pockets. I felt violated, humiliated. The man on the ground was still moaning in pain, and I felt guilty for not being able to help him. Eventually, they let me go with a warning, telling me to mind my own business. I walked away as quickly as I could, my legs shaking. When I got home, I broke down crying. I felt so helpless, so angry at the injustice. I couldn't sleep for days after that.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is still racing a bit. It's hard to talk about, but... I also feel a little relieved. Like a weight has been lifted. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... I've never really told anyone about this before. I've always felt so ashamed, like I should have done something more. But talking about it, I realize how scared I was. How overwhelming it all was.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You did the best you could in a difficult situation.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just hard not to second-guess myself. I keep thinking about that man on the ground, wondering what happened to him. And I can't help but feel angry at those officers. They're supposed to protect people, not terrify them.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have these conflicting emotions. Let's explore them further.",
    "Client: Okay. I think what bothers me most is how powerless I felt. It reminds me of my childhood, always walking on eggshells, never knowing when my parents would explode. I thought I'd left that feeling behind, but this incident brought it all back. I hate feeling weak like that.",
    "Therapist: You're not weak. You're showing great strength by confronting these memories.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard to see it that way sometimes. I've always prided myself on being independent, on not needing anyone. But that night, I felt like a scared child again. It's humbling, and honestly, a bit embarrassing to admit.",
    "Therapist: It takes courage to be vulnerable. You're doing important work here.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I'm realizing that it's okay to not always be strong. That night shook me to my core, but maybe talking about it like this can help me process it better. It's still painful, but it feels less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I feel exhausted, but also... lighter, somehow. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did great work today. We'll continue next session. Take care of yourself."
