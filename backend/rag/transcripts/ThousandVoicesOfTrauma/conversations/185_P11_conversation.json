    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, James?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that memory of the racial incident at school... it brought up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I guess. Remembering how those kids cornered me in the playground, calling me names, making fun of my accent... I felt so alone and scared. It's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the chalk and feel the rough brick wall against my back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. I felt that same tightness in my chest, the same urge to run away. But... I don't know, there was something different too. Like, I could see it from an adult perspective as well? It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Well, as an adult, I can see how wrong those kids were. How it wasn't my fault. But the child in me still feels so... ashamed. Like maybe if I'd been different, it wouldn't have happened. It's frustrating to still feel that way.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains a lot about my anxiety, especially in social situations. I'm always on edge, waiting for someone to point out how I don't belong. Even here in uni, surrounded by people from all over the world, I still feel like an outsider sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... I realized how much that incident still affects me. But also, maybe, that I'm stronger than I thought? I mean, I got through the memory without falling apart. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to work on that shame. Like, intellectually I know it wasn't my fault, but emotionally... that's harder to accept. And maybe... maybe I need to be kinder to that scared kid I used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful, James. How can you practice that?",
    "Client: Um, maybe... when I start feeling anxious in social situations, I could try to remind myself that it's not because there's something wrong with me, but because of what I've been through? And maybe... I don't know, talk to that scared kid part of me, tell him it's okay now?",
    "Therapist: Great ideas. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I think it's helping. I want to keep going. I want to get to a place where those memories don't have so much power over me anymore. It's just... it's exhausting, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What might help you recharge?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe spending some time with my girlfriend tonight? She's always good at helping me relax. Or maybe going for a run? That usually helps clear my head.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like good options. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. I'm feeling pretty drained. But... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. You're doing great work. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm looking forward to a quiet evening now. But... I'll keep working on what we talked about. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, James."
