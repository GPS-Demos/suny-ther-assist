    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the car accident today, and that's got me feeling pretty tense.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm driving home from work. The radio's on, playing some classic rock. I remember feeling pretty good, you know? It had been a productive day at the office.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching an intersection. The light's green, so I'm not slowing down. Then... oh god... I see this blur from the right. This red pickup truck just... it comes out of nowhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I... I can feel my hands gripping the steering wheel so tight. There's this split second where I realize what's about to happen, and I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright. The truck... it slams into my passenger side. There's this deafening crash, and I feel my car spinning. The world's just... it's a blur of color and noise. I can smell burning rubber and... and something else. Maybe gasoline?",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. It's like time slows down, and I have this flash of my wife and kids. I'm thinking I'll never see them again. And then... then everything stops.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's... it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply*",
    "Therapist: Better?",
    "Client: Yeah, a bit. Thanks.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you notice once everything stops?",
    "Client: It's... it's eerily quiet for a second. Then I hear this ringing in my ears. My vision's blurry, but I can see that my windshield is shattered. There's... there's blood on my hands. I think it's from the glass.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm trying to move, but my body feels heavy. I'm... I'm scared to look over at the passenger seat. I don't want to see how bad the damage is. I can hear people shouting outside the car, but it sounds far away.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right. Yeah. Okay. Um... I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt. My hands are shaking so bad, it takes a few tries. I'm starting to smell smoke, and that... that really freaks me out.",
    "Therapist: What happens then?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's someone at my window. It's... it's a woman. She's saying something, but I can't really hear her. She's trying to open my door, but it's jammed. I'm... I'm starting to panic. I feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. The woman, she's... she's telling me to cover my face. Then she smashes the window with something. There's more glass, but I barely feel it. I'm just... I'm so relieved to have a way out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you're being helped out?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. My legs are wobbly, and I'm having trouble focusing. The woman and someone else, they're helping me away from the car. That's when I see the full extent of the crash. My car... it's totaled. And the truck... oh god, the truck is on its side.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried about the other driver. I'm feeling guilty, even though I know it wasn't my fault. And I'm... I'm just overwhelmed with relief that I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of emotions. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: There are sirens. Lots of them. Police, ambulance, fire trucks. It's... it's chaotic. Someone's guiding me to sit down on the curb. A paramedic is checking me over. I'm... I'm trying to ask about the other driver, but my voice isn't working right.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel pain. My neck and back are killing me. My hands are stinging from the cuts. But mostly, I just feel... numb. Like I'm watching everything happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. You're doing great describing this.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's hard, you know? Reliving it like this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit shaky, but okay. It's... it's actually getting a little easier to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens after the paramedics check you?",
    "Client: They... they want to take me to the hospital. I'm trying to refuse, saying I'm fine, but they insist. I'm... I'm worried about my car, about calling my wife. Everything feels so... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. How do you handle it?",
    "Client: I... I kind of shut down. I let them load me into the ambulance. I'm lying there, staring at the ceiling, and it's like... it's like I'm floating. The adrenaline's wearing off, and I'm starting to feel everything.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: Pain. Lots of it. My neck, my back, my head... everything hurts. And I'm... I'm so tired. Like I could sleep for days.",
    "Therapist: How about emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm all over the place. Relieved to be alive, worried about the other driver, angry that this happened, scared about what comes next. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 50?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. Let's stay with it. What happens at the hospital?",
    "Client: It's a blur of tests and questions. X-rays, CT scans, doctors poking and prodding. I'm... I'm getting more anxious as time passes. I keep asking about my wife, if anyone's called her.",
    "Therapist: How does that anxiety feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. I can't stop thinking about how worried she must be. And... and I'm starting to think about what could have happened. How close I came to...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're here now. You survived.",
    "Client: Yeah. Yeah, I did. It's just... it's hard not to think about the what-ifs, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How do you cope with those thoughts in the moment?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on the facts. I'm alive. I'm being taken care of. My wife will be here soon. It... it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: That's a good strategy. What happens next?",
    "Client: Finally, my wife arrives. She's... she's crying and hugging me, and I just break down. It's like... it's like all the emotions I've been holding back just come flooding out.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to let those emotions out?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming, but also kind of relieving. Like... like I can finally breathe again. I'm holding onto her so tight, and I just keep thinking how lucky I am to be here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually pretty low now. Maybe 30?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. How are you feeling about the session overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was tough, but... but I feel like I've processed some of it. It's not as scary to think about now.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly the goal. You did excellent work today. How about we start wrapping up?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I'm... I'm pretty drained, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. You've done some hard work here.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks... thanks for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. We'll pick up here next session. Take care."
