    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's as if I'm right back there, you know? The sounds of the crowded refugee camp, the smell of unwashed bodies and fear... it's all so vivid. I can feel my heart racing, just like it did back then.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Shame. Overwhelming shame. I remember feeling so... so helpless. Unable to protect my children from the harsh realities of our situation. I was supposed to be their mother, their protector, but I couldn't even ensure they had enough to eat.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. I feel hot, especially my face. My shoulders are tense, hunched forward as if I'm trying to make myself smaller. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the cruel words of some of the aid workers. They... they would mock our accents, our customs. One of them said to me, \"You people are like parasites, always wanting more.\" It plays over and over in my head. I feel so... so worthless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. How do these memories connect to your experiences now?",
    "Client: I... I suppose I still carry that feeling of worthlessness with me. Even here in Canada, where I should feel safe, I often feel like I don't belong. Like I'm still that scared, helpless woman in the camp. It's why I rarely leave my apartment these days.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how angry I am. Not just at those who treated us poorly, but at myself for not standing up to them. I was so focused on survival that I didn't defend our dignity. And now... now I'm letting those old fears control me even in this new life.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually somewhat empowering. Like a warmth spreading through my chest. For so long, I've just felt numb or sad. But this anger... it feels like it could push me to make changes, to not let those past experiences define me anymore.",
    "Therapist: Interesting. Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, I'm thinking about my grandchildren. They often ask why I never want to go to the park with them or attend their school events. I've always made excuses, but the truth is, I've been too afraid of feeling out of place, of being judged. But they deserve better from their grandmother. Maybe... maybe it's time I start pushing back against these old fears.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant realization. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... exciting? Like I'm standing on the edge of something new. I've spent so long hiding from the world, convinced that I didn't deserve to be here. But my grandchildren... they see me differently. To them, I'm just Nani, someone they love. Maybe it's time I start seeing myself through their eyes instead of through the lens of my past trauma.",
    "Therapist: What a powerful shift. What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I need to be braver. To start small, maybe, but to push myself to engage with the world again. To remember that I'm not that helpless refugee anymore. I'm a survivor, a mother, a grandmother. I've built a life here, even if I haven't fully embraced it yet. It's time to honor the strength it took to get here by fully living now.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly insightful. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Still a bit shaky from reliving those memories, but also more grounded. Like I've reconnected with a part of myself I'd forgotten. There's fear there, yes, but also hope. And determination. I want to work on this, to reclaim my life from these old traumas.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness today. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on strategies for gradually exposing myself to situations I've been avoiding. Maybe we could start with something small, like a short walk in my neighborhood? I want to start building the confidence to participate in my grandchildren's lives more fully.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent goal. We'll develop a plan together next session. How are you feeling about ending for today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling good about it. A bit drained, but in a positive way, if that makes sense? Like I've done some important work. Thank you for your guidance and support, Dr. Singh. I'm looking forward to our next session.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mrs. Patel. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
