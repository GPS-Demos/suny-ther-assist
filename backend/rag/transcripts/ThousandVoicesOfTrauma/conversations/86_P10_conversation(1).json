    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Adeyemi. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doctor. My hands are a bit shaky. It's hard to think about going back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Can you rate your distress on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say about... 65? My heart's beating fast just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's start when you're ready. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm in our village. It's early morning, the sun's barely up. I can smell the damp earth and hear the roosters crowing. I'm outside our hut, sweeping the yard. My children are still asleep inside. It's quiet, peaceful... but there's this... this feeling in my gut. Something's not right.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I hear it. Engines. Trucks coming. My heart starts racing. I drop the broom and run inside. I'm shaking my husband awake, telling him we need to go. He's groggy, confused. The children are starting to stir. I can hear shouting now, getting closer. Oh God, they're here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe now. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. I can feel the panic rising in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... We're scrambling to grab what we can. I'm shoving clothes into a bag, telling the children to put on their shoes. There's pounding on the door. My husband opens it, and they... they just push in. These men with guns, shouting at us. I pull my children close, trying to shield them. One of the men grabs my arm, yanking me away. I'm screaming, reaching for my babies...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he hits me with the butt of his gun. Right across my face. I taste blood. My husband tries to intervene, but another soldier strikes him down. They're dragging us out of our home. I can see other families being pulled from their houses too. Everyone's crying, screaming. It's chaos.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *breathing slowly* They're herding us towards the trucks. I'm clutching my youngest, trying not to lose sight of the others in the crowd. We're pushed and shoved. I trip, nearly falling. Someone helps me up - a neighbor. We share a look of terror. What's going to happen to us?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Confused. Angry. How can they do this to us? We've done nothing wrong. I'm trying to be strong for my children, but inside I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: We're loaded onto the trucks like cattle. It's hot, cramped. Children are crying. I can barely breathe. The truck starts moving, and I realize... I realize we might never see our home again. I'm holding my children so tight, praying to God to protect us.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, 'This can't be happening. This can't be real.' But it is. I'm wondering if we'll survive this, where they're taking us. I'm scared for my children, for my husband. Will we be separated? Will they hurt us more?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel the chair supporting you.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... The truck's moving for what feels like hours. We're jolted around. People are getting sick. The smell is awful. My arms ache from holding the children, but I won't let go. I can see my husband's face - he looks so defeated. I've never seen him like that before.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We finally stop. The back of the truck opens, and the bright light hurts my eyes. We're at some kind of camp. There are tents, fences. Armed men everywhere. They're shouting at us to get out. People are stumbling, falling. I'm trying to keep my family together, but it's so chaotic.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that scene. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The dust. It's everywhere, choking us. And the noise - people crying, shouting, the guards barking orders. I see families being torn apart. Men separated from women and children. I'm clinging to my husband's hand, but a guard comes and... and...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. What happens?",
    "Client: He... he rips us apart. Just like that. My husband is dragged away. I'm screaming his name, the children are hysterical. I try to run after him, but a guard hits me again. I fall to the ground, my lip split open.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I can barely speak. My distress is 100. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel the safety of this room. You've survived this.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breaths* It's... it's so hard to think about. We're herded into a tent. It's overcrowded, hot. There's no water, no food. Children are crying everywhere. I'm trying to comfort mine, but I'm falling apart inside. I don't know where my husband is, if he's alive. I feel so helpless, so angry.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The days blur together. We're given little food, barely any water. The guards... they're cruel. They laugh at our suffering. I see women being taken away, returning broken. I live in constant fear that they'll take me or my daughters. At night, I lie awake, listening to the sobs around me, the occasional gunshot in the distance.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay strong for my children. I tell them stories, sing quiet songs. But inside, I'm dying. I pray constantly, begging God for mercy, for escape. Some people get sick. There's no medicine. I watch a friend's child die from fever. I'm terrified it will happen to mine.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 100. I can feel the despair, the hopelessness.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: *nods* Yes... yes, I did survive. After weeks - or was it months? - there was a commotion one night. Gunfire, explosions. We huddled in terror, not knowing what was happening. Then suddenly, there were new faces. Aid workers, UN peacekeepers. They were evacuating us. It was chaos, but a different kind. A hopeful kind.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't believe it at first. I was searching desperately for my husband as we were led out. The relief of leaving that hellish place was overwhelming, but the fear of not knowing his fate... it was crushing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 85? I'm shaking, but I feel... I feel like I can breathe again.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *opens eyes slowly* I... I made it through. Again.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You showed incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. There's a weight that feels a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did very well today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you, doctor. I... I never thought I could talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. We'll continue to work through this together."
