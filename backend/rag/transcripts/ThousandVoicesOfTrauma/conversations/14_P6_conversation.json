    "Therapist: Okay, Carlos. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It was late, maybe around 11 PM. I was watching TV in the living room when I heard a strange noise from the kitchen. At first, I thought it was just the house settling, but then I heard it again. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh... probably a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue, please.",
    "Client: I muted the TV and listened carefully. That's when I heard footsteps. They were trying to be quiet, but I could hear them. I felt frozen, like I couldn't move. My palms were sweaty, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My hands are actually getting clammy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I slowly stood up, trying not to make any noise. I wanted to grab my phone, but it was charging in the bedroom. As I took a step towards the hallway, I saw a shadow move. That's when I realized there was someone in my house. I... I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's an 8 now. I can feel my chest tightening, just like that night.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) The intruder must have heard me because suddenly, he rushed into the living room. He was wearing a mask and holding a crowbar. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. He yelled at me to get on the ground, but I was already falling...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My heart is racing, I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (nods) The intruder was shouting, demanding money and valuables. I told him where my wallet was, but he kept yelling. I thought he was going to hit me with the crowbar. I've never felt so terrified in my life.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's normal to feel this way. You're confronting a difficult memory.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) He ransacked the house, throwing things around. I could hear things breaking. I just lay there, praying he wouldn't hurt me. After what felt like hours, but was probably only minutes, he left. I couldn't move for a long time after...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You did really well, Carlos. How about we take a moment to ground ourselves?",
    "Client: Yeah, that... that sounds good. I didn't realize how vivid the memory still was.",
    "Therapist: It's a normal part of the process. You're making progress."
