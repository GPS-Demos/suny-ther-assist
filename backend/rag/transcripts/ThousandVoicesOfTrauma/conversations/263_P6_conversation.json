    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you give me your initial SUDS rating before we start?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm a bit nervous, but not too bad.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's proceed. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: I'm at the accident site. It's dark, and I can smell burning rubber. There's glass everywhere... I can hear people screaming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I... I can see a child trapped in one of the cars. God, it's awful.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to help, but I feel so useless. The child is crying, and I can't reach them. The car door is jammed. I... I think I can smell gasoline.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I'm sweating. It's like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Where are you in the memory now?",
    "Client: I've managed to open the door, but the child is stuck. I can hear sirens in the distance, but they seem so far away. Why aren't they here yet?",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm talking to the child, trying to keep them calm. But I'm panicking inside. What if the car explodes? What if I can't get them out in time?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: That I'm not enough. That I'm going to fail this child. That... that it's all my fault somehow.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefighters arrive. They take over, and I step back. I'm shaking all over. I can't stop staring at the scene.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My mouth is dry, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep describing what you see.",
    "Client: They're getting the child out. There's so much noise - sirens, shouting, the crackling of flames. I feel frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What are you noticing about your reactions?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty for being relieved. Like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's happening now?",
    "Client: A paramedic is checking me over. I can't stop shaking. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm back in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. My SUDS is down to a 4 again.",
    "Therapist: Well done. That was challenging, but you did great."
