    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is still caught up in that moment, you know? My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but part of me still feels like I'm back there, in the middle of that disaster.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during the earthquake. It's like... I can still hear the rumbling, the sound of things crashing around me. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" And then there's this overwhelming guilt because I survived when others didn't. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen again, even though I know it's not.",
    "Therapist: And what emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: It's a mix of fear, sadness, and... anger, I think. I'm angry that this happened, that it's still affecting me after all this time. I'm sad for the lives lost and the damage done. And there's this underlying fear that it could happen again at any moment. It's exhausting to feel all of this at once.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I suppose. Back then, it was like being hit by a tidal wave of emotion. Now, it's more like... like standing in a strong current. It's still powerful, but I feel like I have a bit more control. I can recognize the feelings for what they are, even if I can't always stop them.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you notice about your ability to cope with these memories now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I'm able to talk about it more openly now. Before, I'd just shut down or change the subject. And I'm starting to see that remembering doesn't mean I'm back in danger. It's just a memory, even if it feels real sometimes. I'm learning to ground myself, to remind myself that I'm here, in the present, and I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, honestly. But it's also scary in a way. It's like I'm letting go of something that's been a part of me for so long. There's a part of me that wonders if I deserve to feel better, you know? Especially when I think about those who didn't make it. But then I remind myself that healing doesn't mean forgetting. It's... it's a complex feeling.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What helps you move forward despite these complex feelings?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the support I have now. My friends, this therapy... it helps me see that I'm not alone in this. And there's a small voice inside that says I owe it to myself and to those who didn't survive to live my life fully. It's not always easy to listen to that voice, but it's getting stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, I suppose. Like I'm taking back some control. There's still guilt there, but it's not as overwhelming. I'm starting to see that by healing, I'm honoring those who were lost. It's a way of saying that what happened mattered, that it changed me, but it doesn't define me entirely.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think it means... it means I'm on the right path, even if it's a difficult one. There will still be hard days, I know that. But I'm starting to believe that I can handle them. It's like I'm slowly building a toolkit to deal with these memories and feelings. And each time I face them, like in this exercise, I'm adding to that toolkit.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but also determined. It's not easy to face these memories, but I can see the progress I'm making. It gives me hope that one day, I'll be able to think about what happened without feeling overwhelmed by it. I want to keep going, to see where this journey takes me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Is there anything else you'd like to express before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be okay someday. And that's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your openness. Let's end here for today. Take care."
