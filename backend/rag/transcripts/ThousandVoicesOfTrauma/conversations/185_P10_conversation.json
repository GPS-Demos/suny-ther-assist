    "Therapist: Welcome, Adam. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the school cafeteria. It's loud, kids everywhere. I'm sitting alone, as usual. I can smell the weird mix of pizza and disinfectant. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A group of older kids walks by. I can hear them laughing, but I'm trying not to look up. Then... then I feel something hit the back of my head. It's... it's a banana peel. They've thrown their trash at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm humiliated. Angry. Scared. My face is burning hot. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I look up. One of them, the ringleader, he's sneering at me. He says, \"Go back to where you came from, you dirty foreigner.\" But I was born here. This is my home. I... I don't understand why they hate me so much.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I just sit there. Frozen. I can feel everyone's eyes on me. Some kids are laughing. Others look away, pretending they didn't see. No one helps. I'm all alone.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's creeping up. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to gather my things. My hands are shaking. I knock over my drink, and it spills all over my tray. More laughter. I... I can't take it anymore. I run out of the cafeteria, leaving everything behind.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go?",
    "Client: I run to the bathroom. Lock myself in a stall. I'm... I'm crying. I can't breathe. My chest hurts. I feel so... so worthless.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's racing. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Adam. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I stay in that stall for what feels like hours. I'm afraid to come out. I miss my next class. I can hear other kids coming and going, but I stay silent. I'm... I'm so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering why I'm different. Why can't I just fit in? Maybe... maybe if I was more like them, this wouldn't happen. I hate my skin, my accent, everything that makes me stand out.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present. What do you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the plant on your desk. The blue painting on the wall. Your bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's go back. What happens when you finally leave the bathroom?",
    "Client: The halls are empty. Classes have started. I... I sneak to my locker, grab my backpack. I decide to leave school early. I can't face anyone right now.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: Scared. Angry. Defeated. I feel like a coward for running away, but I don't know what else to do. I... I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What do you do when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I lie to my mom. Tell her I'm not feeling well. I go straight to my room and just... collapse on my bed. I cry for hours. I feel so... so alone.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Adam. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. What happens the next day?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to go to school. I fake being sick. My mom believes me at first, but after a couple of days, she insists I go back. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you prepare to return?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about ways to avoid the cafeteria. Maybe I can eat in the library? Or skip lunch altogether? I'm scared of seeing those kids again. Of being humiliated again.",
    "Therapist: How does that first day back feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's awful. I'm jumpy, paranoid. Every laugh I hear, I think it's about me. I avoid eye contact with everyone. I feel like a ghost, just trying to get through the day without being noticed.",
    "Therapist: What about lunch?",
    "Client: I... I end up hiding in the library. I don't eat. My stomach's in knots anyway. I feel like a coward, but... but at least I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: How long does this go on?",
    "Client: Weeks. Maybe months. I lose track. I start losing weight because I'm skipping meals. My grades suffer because I can't concentrate. I'm... I'm just trying to survive each day.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Adam. Let's take a moment to breathe. In... and out. Now, can you tell me about a moment during this time when you felt a glimmer of hope or strength?",
    "Client: I... I remember one day, a new student joined our class. She was from a different country too. During lunch, I saw her sitting alone, looking scared. And I... I don't know why, but I decided to sit with her.",
    "Therapist: That was very brave. How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: It was... it was terrifying at first. But then... it felt good. We talked about our homes, our families. For the first time in months, I didn't feel alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How did this experience change things for you?",
    "Client: It... it didn't fix everything overnight. But it was a start. We started eating lunch together every day. Sometimes others would join us. I started to feel... less like an outsider.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on this memory make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I still feel the pain of those early experiences, but I also feel... proud? Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight, Adam. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 50?",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session. In... and out. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll process this more next time. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, Adam. I'm proud of you. We'll continue from here next session. Take care."
