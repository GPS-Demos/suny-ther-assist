    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6 out of 10. I'm not panicking, but definitely on edge.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the workplace incident.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* I'm walking into the office. It's a Monday morning, and I can already feel the tension in my shoulders. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's a low hum of conversation and keyboard clicks.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I'm heading to my desk, and I can see my coworkers glancing at me. Some look away quickly, others are whispering. I feel... exposed. Vulnerable. Like everyone knows something I don't.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I'm trying to act normal, but my hands are shaking a bit as I set down my bag. I can feel sweat starting to form on my forehead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I sit down at my desk and try to focus on my computer screen, but I can't shake the feeling of being watched. Then I hear footsteps approaching. It's my supervisor, Marcus. He's got this look on his face... kind of smug, almost predatory. He says, \"Hey there, got a minute?\"",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7 out of 10 now. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm following Marcus to the conference room. The walk feels like it takes forever. Every step is heavy, and I'm hyper-aware of everyone watching us. We get to the room, and he closes the door. The click of the latch feels so final.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Marcus sits across from me, leaning back in his chair. He's got this file in front of him. My performance review, I realize. He starts talking about how my work has been \"subpar\" lately, how I'm not \"fitting in\" with the team. But his words... they're dripping with this undercurrent of... I don't know, disdain? Like he's enjoying this.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... small. Powerless. Like I'm shrinking in my chair. My throat is tight, and I'm fighting back tears. I want to defend myself, but the words won't come out.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear?",
    "Client: I see Marcus's face, his eyes narrowed. I hear the hum of the air conditioning, the muffled sounds of the office outside. My own heartbeat pounding in my ears. He's still talking, but now he's mentioning \"concerns\" from my coworkers. Vague accusations. I realize... they've been talking about me behind my back.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. Take a slow, deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm trying. Marcus is saying something about \"team dynamics\" and how my \"attitude\" is causing problems. But I know what this is really about. It's because I'm different. Because I don't fit their mold. I can feel anger starting to mix with the fear now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Allow yourself to feel those emotions.",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. It comes out shaky at first, but I tell Marcus that I don't understand these accusations. That I've been working hard, that I've never had complaints before. But he just... he just smirks. Says something about how \"people like me\" often have trouble adapting to professional environments.",
    "Therapist: How does that comment make you feel?",
    "Client: It's like a punch to the gut. I feel... rage. Humiliation. Betrayal. My face is burning, and I'm clenching my fists under the table. I want to scream, to flip the table, to... to do something. But I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Marcus is still talking, but his words are blurring together. Something about \"final warning\" and \"improvement plan.\" But all I can focus on is the roaring in my ears, the way my vision is tunneling. I'm nodding mechanically, but inside I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Maybe a 9. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right... right. *deep breath* The meeting is ending. Marcus is standing up, looking down at me with this mix of pity and contempt. He says, \"I hope you can turn things around. We'd hate to lose you.\" But his tone... it's clear he doesn't mean it. As he leaves, I'm just sitting there, feeling... broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I can't move at first. I'm just sitting there, trying to process what happened. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely gather my things. When I finally leave the room, it feels like everyone is staring at me. I can hear whispers, see people averting their eyes. I make it to the bathroom and lock myself in a stall.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm falling apart. Tears are streaming down my face, and I'm trying to muffle my sobs. My chest hurts, like physically hurts. I feel so... so alone. So betrayed. Like everything I've worked for is crumbling around me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe they're right. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I'm not good enough. But then there's this other part of me that's angry. Furious. Because I know I'm being treated unfairly. I'm thinking about all the times I've felt out of place, all the microaggressions, the subtle exclusion. It's all coming to a head.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How long do you stay in the bathroom?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only about 15 minutes. I'm trying to pull myself together, splashing water on my face. But when I look in the mirror, I barely recognize myself. My eyes are red and puffy, and I look... defeated.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I can't face going back out there. I grab my things and leave. I tell the receptionist I'm not feeling well. As I'm walking out, I can feel everyone's eyes on me. The shame, the humiliation... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you're leaving?",
    "Client: I'm a mess of emotions. Anger, fear, sadness, all swirling together. My legs feel weak as I walk to my car. Once I'm inside, I just... I break down again. I'm sobbing, hitting the steering wheel. I feel so powerless, so... so violated.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now. How's your anxiety?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My heart is racing, and I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm... I'm here. In the room with you. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was... it was hard. But I think... I think it helped. To talk about it like that.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breath* I'm... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's focus on five things you can see in this room..."
