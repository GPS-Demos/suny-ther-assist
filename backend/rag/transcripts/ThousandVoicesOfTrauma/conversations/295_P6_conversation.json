    "Therapist: Alright, Priya, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the earthquake.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. I can feel the ground starting to shake. It's early morning, and I'm in the kitchen making chai. The cups are rattling, and suddenly there's this loud rumbling noise. My heart is racing, and I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shaking is getting stronger. I hear screams from outside. I'm trying to move, but I'm so scared. The shelves are falling, dishes crashing everywhere. I'm thinking about my children in their rooms. Oh god, I need to get to them!",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Priya. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm stumbling through the house, calling for my kids. The walls are cracking, and I can hear the roof creaking. I'm terrified it's going to collapse on us. I reach my daughter's room, and she's crying under her bed. I'm trying to coax her out, but she won't move. The shaking is so violent now.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: I manage to pull my daughter out and carry her. We're making our way to my son's room when a part of the ceiling falls right in front of us. I'm screaming, and my daughter is clinging to me so tightly. We barely make it to my son's room. He's awake and terrified. I grab both of them and somehow get us outside. The ground is still shaking, and buildings are collapsing around us. I can hear people trapped, calling for help. I feel so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I can feel tears on my face, and my heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: We're huddled together in the street. The shaking finally stops, but there's dust everywhere, and people are crying and screaming. I'm holding my children, trying to comfort them, but I'm terrified. Our home is damaged, and I don't know what we're going to do. I feel so alone and overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone down a bit, maybe to a 7. I still feel shaky, but the worst of the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was intense, but I got through it. I feel drained, but also a bit proud that I could face it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You did excellent work today, Priya."
