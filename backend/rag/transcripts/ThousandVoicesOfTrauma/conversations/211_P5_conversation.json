    "Therapist: Welcome, [Client's name]. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories of being imprisoned... it's overwhelming. I've spent so long trying to push those thoughts away.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? I've worked so hard to build a life for myself since then, and I'm scared this might undo all of that progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting these memories might affect you?",
    "Client: I'm afraid I'll feel trapped again, like I did back then. The loneliness, the fear, the uncertainty... it was all so overwhelming. I've had nightmares about it, and sometimes during the day, I'll suddenly feel like I'm back there. It's terrifying. I don't want to voluntarily put myself through that again.",
    "Therapist: I hear your fear. How do you cope when those feelings arise now?",
    "Client: Usually, I try to distract myself. I'll throw myself into work or exercise, anything to keep my mind occupied. Sometimes I'll call a friend, though I never tell them what's really going on. I just can't bring myself to talk about it. Other times... well, I hate to admit it, but sometimes I drink to numb the memories.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. The purpose of this exercise is to help you process these memories safely.",
    "Client: I understand that's the goal, but how can reliving trauma possibly be safe? It doesn't make sense to me. And what if it makes my depression worse? I've been struggling with that for so long, and I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout. Shall I explain how this might help?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this. It's hard for me to trust the process when I don't fully grasp the reasoning behind it.",
    "Therapist: The exposure helps your brain process the trauma, reducing its emotional impact over time. It can alleviate PTSD symptoms and depression.",
    "Client: That makes sense in theory, but it's still scary. How will I know if it's working? And what if it doesn't work for me? I feel like I've tried so many things already, and nothing seems to fully address both my PTSD and depression.",
    "Therapist: We'll monitor your progress closely. It's normal to feel worse initially, but many find relief with time. Your resilience is key.",
    "Client: Resilience... I'm not sure I have much of that left. This whole experience has drained me. But I suppose I've made it this far, right? I just... I want to feel normal again. I want to be able to go about my day without constantly looking over my shoulder or feeling like I'm about to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: Your strength in coming here shows resilience. What would \"feeling normal\" look like for you?",
    "Client: Feeling normal... I guess it would mean being able to sleep through the night without nightmares. Being able to form close relationships without constantly fearing abandonment or betrayal. Maybe even feeling joy again, without the guilt that often follows. And definitely not having panic attacks when I see something that reminds me of that time.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. This process can help you work towards them. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still scared, but I want to get better. I want to reclaim my life. Can you just... can you promise me that you'll be here if it gets too much? That we can stop if I need to?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pause whenever you need. Your safety and comfort are paramount. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Okay. Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being so patient with me and explaining everything. It helps to know what to expect, even if it's still frightening. I just hope this will be the turning point I've been waiting for.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
