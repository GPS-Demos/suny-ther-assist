    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, Dr. Chen. Though I must admit, I'm feeling quite apprehensive about it. Could you explain a bit more about what this entails?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting your traumatic memory in a safe environment. This helps reduce its emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. But won't that be incredibly distressing? I've spent years trying to forget those experiences from my childhood and the... the trafficking.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, yes. But it's a crucial step in healing. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Honestly, I'm terrified. The thought of reliving those moments... it makes my heart race. But I trust you, Dr. Chen. If you believe this will help, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're in control. We can pause anytime. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm concerned about how this might affect my daily life. I've managed to function relatively well in my professional life, despite my struggles with substance use. Will this process disrupt that balance?",
    "Therapist: It's a valid concern. We'll work together to manage any impacts. How else can I address your worries?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Chen. I suppose I'm also wondering about the long-term effects. Will this truly help me overcome my PTSD symptoms? And how might it influence my relationship with my wife?",
    "Therapist: Many find it reduces symptoms significantly over time. It can also improve relationships by addressing underlying issues. Shall we discuss specific strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I'm particularly concerned about potential flashbacks or nightmares. I've experienced those before, and they're... well, they're terrifying. How can we manage those if they occur?",
    "Therapist: We'll develop coping strategies together. Grounding techniques can help during flashbacks. What else worries you?",
    "Client: I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. As a professional, I've always prided myself on maintaining composure. The idea of breaking down... it's unsettling.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Remember, this is a safe space. How can we make you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: Perhaps... could we establish a signal or a word that I can use if I need to stop? That might help me feel more in control of the situation.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's choose a word now. What would you like it to be?",
    "Client: How about \"pause\"? It's simple and direct. Yes, I think that would work well.",
    "Therapist: \"Pause\" it is. We'll stop immediately when you say it. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Dr. Chen, I want you to know how much I appreciate your patience and understanding. This isn't easy for me, but knowing that you're here to guide me through it... it helps. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful that this might finally help me address these long-buried issues.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Shall we start with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I could use something to calm my nerves a bit. And Dr. Chen? Thank you. For everything."
