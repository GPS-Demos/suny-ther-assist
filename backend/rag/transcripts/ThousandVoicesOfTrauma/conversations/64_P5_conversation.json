    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the accident lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face this head-on.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... every time I think about that day, losing my brother in that car crash, it feels like I'm right back there. My heart races, I can't breathe, and I feel so helpless. I'm worried that if we talk about it in detail, I might completely fall apart.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today.",
    "Client: Okay... What exactly is imaginal exposure? It sounds intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process traumatic memories. We'll revisit the event in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit it? You mean... like, relive it? I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes me want to run away.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's challenging, but it can help reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: How does that work? I mean, won't talking about it just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Actually, controlled exposure can help your brain process the memory differently. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess... what if I panic during the session? Or what if I can't handle it and need to stop? I'm worried I'll disappoint you or mess up the therapy somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your safety is my priority. We can pause anytime. There's no failing here.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. So, what exactly will we be doing? How detailed do I need to be when talking about... about what happened?",
    "Therapist: We'll start gradually. You'll describe the event, focusing on sensory details and emotions.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. I'm not sure I can talk about it without breaking down. How do you usually help people get through this?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you through it. We'll use breathing techniques and grounding exercises if needed.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your support. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand why this might be important. How long does this usually take?",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about 90 minutes. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: That's a long time to talk about something so painful. But I guess if it helps in the long run... I'm willing to try. Do you really think this will help me move past what happened?",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful. It's a proven method for processing trauma and reducing symptoms.",
    "Client: Okay. I trust you, Dr. Thompson. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to give it a shot. Can we start with something small today, just to ease into it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start wherever you're comfortable. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your understanding and patience. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin with a brief relaxation exercise to center ourselves."
