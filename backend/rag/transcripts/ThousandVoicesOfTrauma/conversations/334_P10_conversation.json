    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just bolt out of here.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our old house. The one with the yellow walls. I'm maybe 8 or 9. It's late afternoon, and I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. The sound is muffled, but I can tell it's getting heated.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the floor of my room, trying to focus on my homework. But I can't concentrate. My heart's racing, and I keep glancing at the door.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shouting gets louder. I hear my mom cry out, and then there's a crash. I... I want to go check on her, but I'm frozen. I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I finally get up. My legs feel like jelly. I creep down the hallway, trying to be as quiet as possible. The kitchen door is slightly open, and I peek through the crack.",
    "Therapist: What do you see?",
    "Client: My mom's on the floor, holding her cheek. There's a broken plate next to her. My dad's standing over her, his fists clenched. He's... he's yelling something about her being useless. I can smell alcohol on his breath from here.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: My mom sees me. Her eyes go wide, and she mouths for me to go back to my room. But I can't move. My dad turns and spots me. His face... it's like a storm cloud. He starts coming towards me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I want to run, but my feet won't listen.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Rahul. This is just a memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: He grabs my arm, hard. It hurts. He's dragging me into the kitchen, shouting about how I should see what a pathetic mother I have. Mom's crying, begging him to let me go. I... I can't breathe. I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're doing well. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. God, this is awful.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Rahul. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. He's still holding my arm, shaking me. He's telling me this is what happens when you marry a worthless woman. Mom's still on the floor, sobbing. I... I wet myself. I'm so ashamed, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Rahul. That was a normal reaction to extreme fear. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad notices. He looks disgusted. He pushes me away, hard. I stumble and hit my head on the counter. Everything goes fuzzy for a moment. When I can focus again, Dad's storming out of the house. The front door slams so hard the windows rattle.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My head hurts where I hit it. Mom's crawling over to me, crying and apologizing. She hugs me tight, but I feel... numb. Like this isn't really happening.",
    "Therapist: That's dissociation, a common response to trauma. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still around 85. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Rahul. Take a few deep breaths. Remember, you're here with me, safe. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Mom helps me up. She's still crying, but trying to be strong for me. She takes me to the bathroom, helps me clean up. The whole time she's whispering that she's sorry, that it won't happen again. But I know it will. It always does.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel towards your mom in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I love her. But I'm also angry. Why doesn't she leave? Why can't she protect us? But mostly, I just feel... helpless. Like we're both trapped.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal feelings, Rahul. What happens next?",
    "Client: After I'm cleaned up, Mom tucks me into bed. It's early, but I'm exhausted. She sits with me, stroking my hair until I fall asleep. But I can't really sleep. I lie there, listening for any sound of Dad coming back. Every car that passes makes me tense up.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. I'm... I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's stay with it a bit longer. What do you remember about the next morning?",
    "Client: I wake up, and for a moment, everything seems normal. Then it all comes flooding back. I'm scared to leave my room. When I finally do, the house is quiet. Too quiet. Mom's in the kitchen, making breakfast like nothing happened. There's a bruise on her cheek that she's tried to cover with makeup.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I don't say anything. Neither does she. We eat in silence. Dad's gone to work already. It's like... like we're pretending it never happened. But I can feel the tension, the fear that it'll happen again.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Scared. Confused. I want to scream, to break something, to make Mom acknowledge what happened. But I don't. I just... go to school, carrying this secret, this weight.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden for a child to bear. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. I feel... tired. Sad.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Rahul. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths. Remember where you are now.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. In your office. I'm... I'm an adult now.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also... I don't know. Like I've let something go that I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after an exposure session. You've shown incredible courage today, Rahul. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40. I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, healing isn't linear. It's okay if you feel upset later. Do you have any thoughts or feelings you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I... I never realized how much that day affected me. How much I still carry it with me. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful, Rahul. We'll continue to work through this together. For now, let's focus on grounding yourself. Look around the room and name five things you can see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see your plant in the corner, the blue painting on the wall, my shoes, your desk lamp, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my jeans, my watch, and... the softness of this tissue in my hand.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Great job. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of your air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: Perfect. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful, Rahul. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. Grounded.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. You've done incredible work today. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. Use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed. And don't hesitate to call if you need support. We'll process this more in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was... intense. But I think it helped. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Rahul. You should be proud of yourself."
