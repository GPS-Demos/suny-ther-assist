    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol in Afghanistan. It was a hot day, and we were walking through a small village. Suddenly, I heard growling. Before I could react, a large dog lunged at me. Its teeth were bared, and I could see the fury in its eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The dog clamped onto my arm. I felt its teeth pierce through my uniform. The pain was intense, and I could feel warm blood trickling down my arm. I tried to shake it off, but it wouldn't let go. My heart was racing, and I couldn't think straight.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... My squad mates were yelling, but it sounded distant. All I could focus on was the dog's snarling face and the pain in my arm. I managed to reach for my knife with my free hand. I didn't want to hurt the dog, but I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: I stabbed at the dog's side. It yelped and finally released my arm. As it ran away, I collapsed to the ground. My arm was throbbing, and I felt dizzy from the shock and blood loss. My team rushed to help me, but I couldn't shake the fear and helplessness I felt.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is pounding, and I can almost feel the pain in my arm again. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: After that, I couldn't sleep well for weeks. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those teeth coming at me. I started drinking to numb the fear and the memories. It helped for a while, but it just made everything worse in the long run.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part wasn't even the physical pain. It was the feeling of vulnerability. One moment I was a trained soldier, and the next, I was completely helpless against this animal. It shattered my sense of control and safety. I've never felt the same since then.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I still have nightmares about it. I'll wake up in a cold sweat, feeling those teeth on my arm. It's why I started avoiding dogs altogether. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it. Even seeing a dog on TV can trigger those memories.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The attack changed how I view the world. I'm always on edge, always expecting danger. It's exhausting. I feel like I can never fully relax. And the drinking... it became my coping mechanism. I knew it wasn't healthy, but it was the only way I could numb those feelings and memories.",
    "Therapist: You're very self-aware. That's important.",
    "Client: I've tried to talk about it before, but people don't understand. They think, \"It's just a dog bite, get over it.\" But it's so much more than that. It's about losing control, feeling powerless. It's about how one moment can change your entire life.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Continue.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder who I'd be if this hadn't happened. Would I still be in the military? Would I be able to enjoy a simple walk in the park without constantly scanning for threats? It's like the attack stole a part of me that I can't get back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, maybe a little lighter? Talking about it is hard, but keeping it bottled up is harder. I just want to feel normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know this is just the beginning, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be hope. Like maybe I can work through this and not let it control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Well done today."
