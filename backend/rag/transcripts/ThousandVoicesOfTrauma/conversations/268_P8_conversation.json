    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding pretty hard. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm back there again, in that moment when I realized what was happening.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I keep seeing their faces, the people who were trapped with me. The fear in their eyes. I remember feeling so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to save them or myself. It's making me feel sick to my stomach just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah, okay. It's just... when I think about that warehouse, the smells, the sounds... it's like I'm right back there. I can feel the cold concrete floor beneath me, hear the muffled sobs of the others. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something? Why couldn't I help them?\"",
    "Therapist: How does that thought make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. So incredibly guilty. And angry at myself. I know, logically, that there wasn't much I could've done. We were all trapped, all terrified. But there's this part of me that keeps insisting I should've been braver, should've found a way out.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm noticing how tense my body feels. My shoulders are so tight, and my fists are clenched. It's like my body is ready to fight or run, even though I know I'm safe here. And there's this... this deep sadness too. For what I've lost, for what all of us lost in that place.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength by facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't feel like strength though. It feels like... like I'm barely holding it together. But at the same time, there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like, I'm finally letting myself feel all of this instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the aftermath. The hospital, the police interviews, trying to explain to my family what happened. It's all jumbled up in my head with the actual event. I remember feeling so disconnected from everything, like I was watching my life from the outside. And now, talking about it, it's like I'm reconnecting with those feelings. It's scary, but also... maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that reconnection?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, to go back to that numbness. But another part knows that I need to face this. It's like... like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that I lost in that warehouse. It hurts, but it also feels like... like I'm finally acknowledging what happened to me, to all of us.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. I never thought about it that way before. It's like... by facing these memories, I'm refusing to let them control me anymore. I'm scared, and it hurts, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm taking back some of the power that was taken from me.",
    "Therapist: How does that strength feel?",
    "Client: It feels... fragile, but real. Like a small flame that I need to protect and nurture. I'm realizing that even though I couldn't control what happened to me, I can control how I deal with it now. That's... that's kind of empowering, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly can be. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, my breathing is getting a little easier. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. And I'm... I'm starting to feel more present in the room, rather than lost in the memory. It's like... like I'm slowly coming back to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's a relief, honestly. But it's also a bit scary. It's like... I've been holding onto these memories and emotions so tightly for so long, and now I'm starting to let them go. It's freeing, but also... I don't know, maybe a little disorienting? Like I'm not quite sure who I am without all of this weighing me down.",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty is normal. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's part of the healing process, right? Learning who I am beyond the trauma. It's scary, but also kind of exciting. Like I'm rediscovering parts of myself that I thought were lost forever. And maybe... maybe I'm even finding new strengths I didn't know I had.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeful, I think. For the first time in a long time, I'm starting to believe that maybe I can move past this. Not forget it, but... learn to live with it in a way that doesn't consume me. It's a small hope, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much energy it's taken to keep all of this bottled up inside. It's like... like I've been carrying this massive weight, and now I'm finally starting to put it down. It's exhausting, but also... kind of liberating? Like I might actually be able to focus on other things in my life now, instead of just surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Scary, but good. Like I'm taking my first steps on a long journey. I know it won't be easy, and I'll probably have setbacks, but... I think I'm ready to try. To really work on healing and moving forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. What's going through your mind now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about the future, actually. For so long, I couldn't imagine anything beyond just getting through each day. But now, I'm starting to wonder what my life could look like if I'm not constantly haunted by these memories. It's both exciting and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel both. What else?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling grateful, I think. For this space to process everything, for the chance to face these memories head-on. It's painful, but it also feels necessary. Like I'm finally giving myself permission to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you want to move forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. To keep facing these memories and feelings, even when it's hard. I want to learn how to live with what happened without letting it define me. And... I think I want to find ways to help others who've been through similar experiences. Maybe turn this pain into something positive, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a admirable goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like I've done something important today. I'm still scared about what's to come, but I also feel more... I don't know, more equipped to handle it? Like I've taken a big step forward, even if I'm not sure where the path leads.",
    "Therapist: That's a great place to end. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really, thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say."
