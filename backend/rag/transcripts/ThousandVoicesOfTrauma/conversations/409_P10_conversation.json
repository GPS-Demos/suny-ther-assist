    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the border. It's hot, so hot. There are people everywhere, pushing, shoving. I can smell sweat and dust. My mom... she's holding my hand so tight it hurts.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're in line. It's moving so slowly. I'm thirsty, but we ran out of water hours ago. My little sister is crying. Mom keeps shushing her, looking around nervously.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue. What do you hear?",
    "Client: There's shouting. Someone up ahead is arguing with the border guards. I can't understand what they're saying, but it sounds angry. Mom pulls us closer to her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. What if they don't let us through? What if they send us back? We can't go back, it's not safe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a commotion. People are running, screaming. I don't know what's happening. Mom... oh God, Mom lets go of my hand. I can't see her anymore.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're here in the room with me. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. It helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I'm calling for my mom, but I can't hear my own voice over the chaos. People are pushing past me. I'm being shoved around. I fall... I can taste dirt in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can't breathe. I'm... I'm panicking. I need to find my mom and sister.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to stand up. I'm searching frantically, calling out. Then... then I see her. Mom's on the ground. There's... there's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I can't... This is too much. I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Carlos. This is just a memory. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... okay. Um, your desk. The plant in the corner. The clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, let's continue.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm running towards my mom. People are still pushing, but I don't care. I reach her and... and she's not moving. Her eyes are open, but she's not seeing anything.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. Shocked. This can't be real. Where's my sister? I look around and I can't see her anywhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone grabs my arm. It's a border guard. He's yelling at me in English, but I don't understand. I'm trying to stay with my mom, but he's pulling me away.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, okay. I... I let the guard pull me away. I'm in shock, I think. They take me to a holding area. There are other kids there, all alone. I keep asking about my sister, but no one understands me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Lost. Completely lost. And guilty. I left my mom there. I should have stayed with her.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Carlos. You were a child in an impossible situation.",
    "Client: I know that now, but then... I felt like I'd failed her. Failed both of them.",
    "Therapist: What happens after that?",
    "Client: Days pass. Maybe weeks. I'm not sure. They move us to a facility. It's cold, sterile. I share a room with other boys. We don't talk much. I keep hoping my sister will show up, but she never does.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not really. I'm just existing. I cry at night when no one can hear me. During the day, I'm just... empty.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit lower. Maybe 60? Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, they tell me they've found my aunt in the States. She's going to take me in. I should be happy, but... I just feel numb.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. How do you see yourself at this point?",
    "Client: I see... I see a shell of who I was. A boy who's lost everything. Who doesn't know who he is anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. Stay with it for a moment.",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to look at. I want to turn away, to forget.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult, but you're doing great. What happens when you meet your aunt?",
    "Client: She... she cries when she sees me. Hugs me tight. But I can't hug her back. I can't feel anything. She talks about how we'll make a new life, but all I can think about is what I've left behind.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel now, looking back?",
    "Client: Sad. So sad. For her, trying so hard. For me, unable to appreciate it. For my mom and sister... gone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that sadness. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 50 now. Talking about it... it helps. It hurts, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Carlos. How do you see yourself now, compared to that boy?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm stronger now. Still damaged, maybe, but... healing. I can feel things again. I can remember my mom and sister without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel about the journey you've been on?",
    "Client: It's been hard. So hard. But... I'm proud of myself. For surviving. For not giving up.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a weight I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've done excellent work today, Carlos. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Your desk. The plant. The clock. The bookshelf. And... the photo of the beach on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The chair I'm sitting on. My jeans. The armrest. The floor with my feet.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. Traffic outside. My own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... my mouth. Maybe a bit dry.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Carlos. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. Like I'm fully back here.",
    "Therapist: That's good to hear. You've made significant progress today. Remember to be kind to yourself as you process this. Do you have any questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It was, and you did wonderfully. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. Take care, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will."
