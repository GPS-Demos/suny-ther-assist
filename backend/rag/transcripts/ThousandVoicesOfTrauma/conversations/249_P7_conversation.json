    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about 15 years ago. I was feeling lost after my divorce, and a friend introduced me to this group. At first, it seemed like a supportive community. We'd meet in this old warehouse downtown. The leader, he was charismatic, always talking about how we were special, chosen. I remember the smell of incense, the dim lighting...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As time went on, things started to change. The leader became more controlling. We were encouraged to cut ties with family and friends who weren't part of the group. I started giving them more and more of my savings. I felt trapped, but also afraid to leave. One night, during a ritual, I saw the leader... he was...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He was abusing one of the younger members. I felt sick, disgusted. I wanted to leave, but I was scared. They had all my information, my money. I felt so ashamed for not seeing it sooner, for being fooled.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep that night. The next day, I pretended everything was normal, but I was planning my escape. It took me a week to gather the courage. I left in the middle of the night, just walked out with a small bag. I felt like I was being watched for months after. The guilt, the fear, it's still with me. I lost so much time, so much of myself...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about. I feel like such a fool. I should have known better at my age. But I was vulnerable after the divorce, and they took advantage of that. The worst part is, I still sometimes miss the sense of belonging I had at the beginning. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: It's a normal reaction. Continue.",
    "Client: After I left, I was lost. I had to rebuild my life from scratch. My family was hesitant to take me back at first. They couldn't understand how I'd fallen for it. I couldn't even explain it myself. The depression hit hard. I felt like I'd wasted years of my life, given away my savings, my trust. Sometimes I still have nightmares about being trapped there.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's bringing back a lot of those feelings. The shame, the fear. But also, I guess, some pride that I managed to get out. It wasn't easy. I'm still dealing with the aftermath, the trust issues, the financial struggles. But I'm here, I'm free. Sometimes I wonder about the others who were still there when I left. I hope they found their way out too.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. Let's pause here."
