    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having trouble sleeping lately, thinking about the accident and... well, you know.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Ready?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. What exactly does that mean? It sounds a bit scary, to be honest. Will I have to relive everything?",
    "Therapist: It's facing the memory in a safe space. Thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to get better, but another part is terrified of going back there. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just... ever since that night, when I saw that terrible car crash on my way home from the library, I've been struggling. I can't get the images out of my head. The screaming, the blood... it's like it's happening all over again every time I close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: That's why we're here. This process helps reduce those intrusions.",
    "Client: Really? How does that work? I mean, won't talking about it make it worse?",
    "Therapist: Initially challenging, but it lessens the memory's power over time.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. My grades are slipping, I've been isolating myself from my boyfriend and my parents are worried. I feel like I'm disappointing everyone.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave for being here. This is a step forward.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I just want to feel normal again. To be able to drive without panicking, to sleep through the night without nightmares. Do you really think this will help?",
    "Therapist: Yes. Many have found relief through this method. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. What do I need to do?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Describe the event as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Right now? Oh gosh... okay. Um, I'm driving home from the library. It's late, around 11 PM. The road is dark, just a few streetlights... I'm tired, thinking about my exam tomorrow...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue. What do you see next?",
    "Client: I... I see headlights in my rearview mirror. They're moving fast, swerving. Then suddenly, there's a loud crash and... oh God, I can hear the screaming...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I pull over. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely turn off the engine. I get out of the car and... there's so much broken glass everywhere. The other car is upside down and... there's someone trapped inside...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here, safe with me.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm trying to stay calm. But my heart is racing just like it did that night. Is this normal?",
    "Therapist: Completely normal. Your bravery is commendable. Shall we continue?"
