    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving down the highway, it's a sunny day. The radio's on, playing some old R&B. I remember feeling relaxed, tapping my fingers on the steering wheel. Then suddenly, there's a loud screech. My heart starts racing. I see this truck swerving into my lane. It's happening so fast, but also in slow motion. I try to brake, but there's not enough time. The impact is deafening. My body jerks forward, the airbag deploys. I can't breathe. The smell of burning rubber and metal fills my nose. I'm trapped, my legs are pinned. People are shouting outside, but it sounds muffled, like I'm underwater. I'm panicking, thinking I might die here.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 8. My heart's pounding just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to move, but every shift sends pain shooting through my body. My vision's blurry, there's blood trickling down my face. I hear sirens in the distance. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if I'll see them again. The fear is overwhelming. Someone's at my window now, telling me to stay still, that help is coming. But I can't calm down. I feel so helpless, so vulnerable. The pain is getting worse, and I'm starting to feel light-headed.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're working to get me out, but every movement is agony. I hear them talking about possible internal bleeding. That terrifies me even more. They finally free me from the wreckage, and as they lift me onto the stretcher, the pain is excruciating. I'm fading in and out of consciousness during the ambulance ride. The lights are so bright, the siren so loud. I keep thinking about how quickly everything changed, how close I came to dying. At the hospital, it's a blur of tests and doctors. The pain medication helps, but I can't shake the fear and shock.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The next few days in the hospital are a haze of pain and anxiety. Every time I close my eyes, I see the truck coming at me. I can't sleep without nightmares. The doctors tell me I'm lucky to be alive, but I don't feel lucky. I feel broken, both physically and mentally. The realization that I'll have chronic pain from this accident starts to sink in. I'm overwhelmed with anger, fear, and sadness. Why did this happen to me? How will I ever feel safe driving again? The thought of getting back in a car paralyzes me with fear.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but I feel a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. But my breathing is a bit steadier than before.",
    "Therapist: Good observation. Try to relax those areas if you can.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. You know, it's strange. As terrifying as it is to relive this, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? To finally be talking about it in detail. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. That's a common experience. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think I can continue. The weeks after leaving the hospital were really tough. The physical pain was constant, but the emotional pain was even worse. I felt so isolated. Friends would visit, but I couldn't explain what I was going through. The flashbacks were intense, especially at night. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I was back in that car. The guilt started creeping in too - maybe if I'd been more alert, I could've avoided the accident. I know it's not logical, but the thought keeps haunting me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. Talking about the aftermath is easier than the accident itself.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad it's a bit easier. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: Thanks. It helps to hear that. You know, one of the hardest parts was feeling like I'd lost control of my life. My business suffered because I couldn't work. My relationship was strained because I was irritable and withdrawn. I felt like a burden to everyone. The chronic pain was a constant reminder of what happened. Some days, I didn't want to get out of bed. The future seemed so bleak. But slowly, very slowly, I started to have moments where I felt okay. They were brief at first, but they gave me hope. That's when I decided to seek therapy. I realized I couldn't navigate this alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: And how are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud? For facing this head-on.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. This takes courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's been a long journey, and I know I still have a way to go. But being here, talking about it like this... it feels like a step forward. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can work through this and find some peace.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Shall we end the exercise here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's a good place to stop. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How about we take a few deep breaths together?"
