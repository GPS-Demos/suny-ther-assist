    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Noted. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the beach. It's a sunny day, and I can hear the waves crashing. I'm walking along the shoreline, feeling the warm sand between my toes. The air smells salty, and there's a light breeze. I see a group of people further down the beach, they're laughing and playing volleyball. I'm... I'm feeling relaxed, actually.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I decide to go for a swim. The water's cool against my skin as I wade in. It's refreshing. I start swimming parallel to the shore, enjoying the gentle waves. Then... then I feel something brush against my leg. At first, I think it's just seaweed, but...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you feel?",
    "Client: My heart starts racing. I feel a sharp pain in my calf. I look down and see blood in the water. Oh god, it's a shark. I'm panicking now, trying to swim back to shore, but my leg hurts so much. I'm yelling for help, but the people on the beach seem so far away.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I'm thrashing in the water, trying to keep my head above the surface. The shark circles back. I can see its fin cutting through the water. I'm terrified. I manage to start swimming towards the shore, but my movements are clumsy and slow. The salt water is stinging my wound. I can hear people shouting from the beach now, but they sound so distant.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I feel another sharp pain, this time on my arm. The shark has attacked again. The water around me is turning red. I'm crying out in pain and fear. I think I'm going to die. I can't... I can't breathe properly. My limbs feel heavy.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. Slow your breathing.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I'm still in the water, but I can see people swimming towards me. A lifeguard, I think. The shark seems to have gone. I'm trying to stay afloat, but I'm so tired. The lifeguard reaches me and starts pulling me towards the shore. I can hear the commotion on the beach, people calling for an ambulance.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take another deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: We reach the shore. People are crowding around. Someone's applying pressure to my wounds. I'm shivering, partly from shock, partly from the cool air on my wet skin. The pain is intense. I can hear sirens in the distance. Everything seems to be moving in slow motion. I'm scared, but also relieved to be out of the water.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but their voices sound muffled. I'm being lifted onto a stretcher. The movement makes the pain worse, and I cry out. They're putting an IV in my arm, covering me with a blanket. I catch a glimpse of my injuries and feel nauseated. The sky above me is so bright, almost blindingly so.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about how close I came to dying. How helpless I felt in the water. I'm worried about the extent of my injuries, if I'll be able to use my arm and leg normally again. And... and I'm angry. Angry at the shark, angry at myself for swimming alone.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm in the ambulance now. The sirens are loud. The paramedic is asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. The pain is still intense, but they've given me something for it. I'm feeling a bit disconnected, like this is happening to someone else. I can hear the radio, they're communicating with the hospital.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell of antiseptic. The bumps in the road as we drive. I'm still shivering. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently. The paramedic is saying something about blood loss, but I'm not sure I understand. I'm scared about what's going to happen at the hospital.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Both physically and emotionally. My SUDS is probably around a 6 now. The fear is still there, but it's less intense.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue with the hospital arrival.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. There's a flurry of activity as I'm wheeled into the emergency room. Bright lights, lots of voices. Doctors and nurses surrounding me. They're cutting away my swim trunks, examining my wounds. I hear words like \"severe lacerations\" and \"possible nerve damage.\" I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. When you're ready, go on.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. They're taking me for scans now. MRI, I think. The machine is loud and claustrophobic. I'm trying not to panic. After that, it's back to the ER. A doctor is explaining that I need surgery. Something about repairing muscle damage and stopping the bleeding. I'm signing consent forms, but it all feels surreal.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared about the surgery. Worried about the long-term effects. Will I be able to swim again? Will I have lasting trauma? And... I'm feeling guilty. My family will be so worried when they find out.",
    "Therapist: These are all normal thoughts. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's around a 5 now. I'm still anxious, but the immediate panic has subsided.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue with the surgery preparation.",
    "Client: They're prepping me for surgery now. An anesthesiologist is explaining the procedure. I'm trying to focus on his words, but part of me is still back on that beach. They're wheeling me into the operating room. The lights are so bright. I can feel my heart racing again as they put the mask over my face. I'm counting backward from 10, feeling the anesthesia take effect...",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: I... I don't remember the surgery itself. The next thing I know, I'm waking up in the recovery room. Everything feels hazy. There's a dull pain in my leg and arm. A nurse is checking my vitals. I'm groggy, but I remember what happened. The reality of the situation starts to sink in.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... vulnerable. Weak. But also grateful to be alive. My SUDS is probably around a 4 now. The fear is still there, but it's mixed with relief.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm moved to a regular room. The doctor comes in to explain the surgery. Multiple stitches, some muscle repair. He says I was lucky - no major arteries were hit. I'll need physical therapy, but I should regain full function. It's good news, but I'm overwhelmed by the recovery process ahead.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. I'm relieved that the injuries weren't worse, but I'm anxious about the recovery. I'm dreading the pain of physical therapy. And... I'm realizing that this experience will stay with me. I don't know if I'll ever be able to go back in the ocean without fear.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. I'm feeling more calm, but there's still an undercurrent of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start wrapping up. How do you see yourself coping in the days following?",
    "Client: I imagine it'll be tough. Lots of pain, frustration with the slow healing process. I'll probably have nightmares about the attack. But... I also see myself surrounded by supportive friends and family. I think I'll gain a new appreciation for life, for the small things I took for granted.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful perspective. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. My SUDS is down to a 2. Talking through it like this, it feels less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you. This was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll continue to work through this in our next sessions."
