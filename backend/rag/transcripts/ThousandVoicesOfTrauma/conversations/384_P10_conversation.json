    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, but another part that's terrified. It's like my body knows we're going to talk about difficult things, and it's already tensing up.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a quick check-in. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach's in knots, but I'm trying to breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in the refugee camp. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down on the tents. I can smell sweat and dust everywhere. There are so many people crammed into this small space. I'm sitting on the ground, my back against a tent pole. My legs are aching from the long journey...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I hear children crying, adults arguing in languages I don't understand. There's a constant buzz of activity. I'm so thirsty, but I'm afraid to drink the water they've given us. My mouth feels like sandpaper.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Alright. I see a group of men approaching our section of the camp. They're carrying clipboards, looking official. My heart starts racing. Are they here to send us back? I can't go back, I just can't...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel like I can't breathe. I want to run, but where would I go? There's nowhere safe...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe now. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I'm trying to make myself smaller, hoping they won't notice me. But then one of them points in my direction. Oh God, they're coming over...",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Can you feel your feet on the floor? Focus on that for a moment.",
    "Client: (pauses) Yes, I can feel the carpet. It's... it's helping a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with what's happening in the camp.",
    "Client: The man with the clipboard is standing over me now. He's asking questions in broken English. \"Name? Age? Family?\" I'm stumbling over my words, trying to remember the fake name I was told to use. I'm terrified I'll say the wrong thing and ruin everything...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I can barely hear his questions over the roaring in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Take a moment to ground yourself if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) I'm... I'm okay. I can do this. The man is writing something down. I want to peek at his clipboard, but I'm too scared to move. What if he sees me looking and thinks I'm suspicious?",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This is it. They're going to send me back. All of this was for nothing.\" I'm trying to remember my children's faces, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The guilt is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does the guilt feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. I can barely breathe. I left them behind to try and make a better life for us all, but what if I've just made everything worse? What kind of mother am I?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here in the present. Take a moment to feel the chair supporting you.",
    "Client: (pauses) Yes, I can feel it. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what happens next in the camp?",
    "Client: The man finishes writing and moves on to the next person. I'm shaking all over, but I've made it through. I want to cry with relief, but I'm too scared to draw attention to myself. I just sit there, trying to look calm, but inside I'm a mess.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: It's like all my muscles are clenched tight. My jaw hurts from gritting my teeth. I'm exhausted, but I can't relax. I keep scanning the crowd, wondering if they'll come back, if they'll realize they made a mistake...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with those sensations.",
    "Client: The day drags on. The heat is unbearable. I'm so thirsty, but I'm still afraid to drink. What if the water makes me sick? What if I need medical help and they realize I don't belong here? I'm starting to feel dizzy...",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath and feel the air filling your lungs.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... I'm trying to focus on my breathing, but it's hard. The memories are so vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: As night falls, the camp becomes eerily quiet. The darkness feels suffocating. I can hear people whispering, crying softly. I'm huddled in a corner of a tent, trying to sleep, but every sound makes me jolt awake. I keep thinking about my children, wondering if they're safe, if they're missing me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. So much guilt. And fear. I'm terrified that I've made the wrong choice, that I'll never see them again. But I'm also determined. I have to make this work. I have to find a way to bring them here, to give them a better life...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe.",
    "Client: (nods) Yes, I know. It's just... it feels so real when I talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The night seems to last forever. I drift in and out of a restless sleep, plagued by nightmares. When dawn finally breaks, I'm exhausted but relieved. I made it through the night. As people start to stir around me, I force myself to get up, to face another day...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you start this new day?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, but there's also a tiny spark of hope. I survived yesterday. Maybe I can survive today too. I stand up, my body aching from sleeping on the hard ground. I look around at the other faces, seeing the same mix of fear and determination...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down more. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Take a moment to acknowledge how far you've come.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) You're right. I did make it through. It was horrible, but I survived.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Now, let's start to bring you back to the present. Slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (opens eyes slowly) Wow... that was intense. But... I feel different. Like I faced it and came out the other side.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but also kind of proud? I didn't think I could talk about it like that.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed immense courage. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40, I think. Similar to when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about what we did today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... I think it helped? I feel like I understand my experience better now, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does make sense. You've taken a big step today. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous about doing it again, but I can see how it might help. I want to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude, Sarah. We'll take it one step at a time. For now, let's do a quick grounding exercise before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay, I'd like that. Thank you... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. You did the hard work. Now, let's focus on your breathing..."
