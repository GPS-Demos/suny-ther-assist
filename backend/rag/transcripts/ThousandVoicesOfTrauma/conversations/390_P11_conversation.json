    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the ambush... it's so vivid. I could almost smell the dust and hear the gunfire again. It's like I was right back there in Afghanistan.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most about revisiting that experience?",
    "Client: The chaos. Everything happened so fast. One minute we were on a routine patrol, and the next... explosions, gunfire, screaming. I keep seeing Private Johnson's face. He was so young, barely 20. I was his team leader, and I couldn't... I couldn't save him.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt guilty, scared, angry. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little less overwhelmed than before? Like, I could observe it a bit more, if that makes sense. Still awful, but... I didn't completely lose myself in it this time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, in the past, when I'd think about that day, it was like I was right back there. I'd panic, couldn't breathe. But today, even though it was still scary and painful, I felt... more grounded? Like I could acknowledge it was a memory, not happening right now. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this relates to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's showing that I can face these memories without completely falling apart? I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of Afghanistan for so long. But going through this exposure, as hard as it is, makes me feel like I'm taking some control back. The nightmares and flashbacks have been ruling my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you think about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? Part of me wants to run away and never do this again. But... I'm tired of feeling stuck. If this can help me process what happened and move forward, I want to keep trying. It's just... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What strategies helped you today?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we practiced really helped. When I felt myself getting too anxious, focusing on my breath brought me back to the present. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory... that helped too.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How might you apply these insights moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try using these techniques when I have flashbacks at home? And... I don't know. Maybe I can start talking to my partner more about my experiences? I've been so closed off, but maybe sharing a bit might help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Maybe even a little proud? I never thought I could face this memory without completely losing it. It's a small step, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on that night patrol memory? It's been haunting me a lot lately. And... could we spend some time on how to talk to my partner about this? I want to open up, but I'm not sure how.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address both next time. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's tough, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to have hope that maybe I can get through this, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your progress is remarkable. We'll continue this journey together."
