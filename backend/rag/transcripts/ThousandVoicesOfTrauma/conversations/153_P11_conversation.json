    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memories feel so vivid, like I'm right back there in the cult compound. The smells, the sounds, the fear... it's all so intense. I can still hear the leader's voice ringing in my ears, you know? It's like I never left.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The sense of isolation, I think. Even though we were all there together, I felt so alone. It's strange because I experienced that during my time in combat too, but this was different. In the cult, it was like my identity was being stripped away piece by piece. I remember thinking, \"Who am I becoming?\" It's terrifying to look back on.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess I still struggle with feeling isolated sometimes. Even though I'm in a relationship now, there are moments when I feel like no one can truly understand what I've been through. It's like I'm still carrying that sense of being an outsider with me. And the depression... it amplifies that feeling, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... challenging. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But, oddly enough, I also felt a sense of... I don't know, maybe strength? Like, I survived that, and I'm here now, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that feeling of strength?",
    "Client: I guess it's a reminder that I'm resilient. I've been through so much - the war, the cult - and yet here I am. It's easy to forget that when the depression hits hard. But going through these memories, as difficult as it is, it's like... it's proof that I can endure. Maybe that's something I can hold onto when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you use that moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to remind myself of this strength when I'm feeling low. Like, create some kind of mantra or something? \"I've overcome before, I can overcome again.\" Does that sound cheesy? (laughs nervously)",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How else might this insight help you?",
    "Client: Well, maybe it could help me open up more to my partner. I've been hesitant to share a lot of this stuff, but... if I can recognize my own strength, maybe I can trust them to see it too? It's scary, but... maybe it's time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. But I think I'm starting to see the value in it. It's like... facing these memories head-on is helping me reclaim parts of myself I thought I'd lost. It's painful, but... I think I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could delve into some of the specific rituals from the cult? It's something I've been avoiding, but I feel like it might be important to confront. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll approach it at your pace. Any final thoughts today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who can sit with me in these memories without judgment. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also... hopeful? Yeah, I think that's the word. Hopeful."
