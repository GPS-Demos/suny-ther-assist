    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Jake?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. I feel drained, you know? Going through that memory of being bullied in high school, it brought up so many emotions. I could almost feel the fear and humiliation all over again. But there's also this weird sense of relief, like I've finally confronted something I've been avoiding for years.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The vivid details, I guess. I could see their faces so clearly, hear their taunts. It's funny, I thought I'd forgotten a lot of it, but it all came rushing back. The worst part was remembering how helpless I felt, how I couldn't defend myself. It makes me angry now, thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a tightness in my chest. My hands are clenched just talking about it. But it's different from before. It used to feel overwhelming, like it would consume me. Now it's there, but I can handle it. I think that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How else has this process affected you?",
    "Client: Well, it's made me realize how much those experiences have shaped me. I've always been wary of authority figures, especially the police. I think that's why the recent news about police brutality has hit me so hard. It brings back that feeling of powerlessness, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you cope with those feelings now?",
    "Client: I'm trying to be more proactive. I've started volunteering with a local community organization that works on police reform. It helps me feel like I'm doing something positive instead of just feeling helpless. But sometimes, I still get these intense anxiety spikes when I see police officers.",
    "Therapist: What helps during those moments?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been really helpful. And I try to remind myself that I'm safe now, that I'm not that vulnerable kid anymore. It doesn't always work, but it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I think I'm getting better at opening up to my partner. I used to keep everything bottled up, afraid of seeming weak. But going through this therapy has shown me that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's actually bringing us closer together.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I guess? And a little scary. But mostly good. I feel less alone, more supported. It's like I'm finally letting go of this weight I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. I know there's still a lot to process, especially around my fears related to authority and police. But I feel more hopeful now, like I can actually overcome this. And I want to use my experiences to help others who've been through similar things. Maybe that's how I turn this negative into something positive, you know?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a powerful goal. How can we support that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on building my confidence in speaking about my experiences? And perhaps some strategies for managing anxiety when I'm doing advocacy work? I want to be effective, but I also need to take care of myself.",

    "Client: Tired, but good. Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I can see it's making a difference.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Jake. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. Thanks again, doc. See you then."
