    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it's all so vivid. My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the image of the plane going down, the screams, the chaos... (deep breath) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's this... this primal terror that just washes over me. I can feel my hands trembling, and there's this cold sweat on my skin. It's like my body is preparing for the worst all over again. But there's also this... guilt, I suppose. Survivor's guilt, maybe? I keep thinking about the others who didn't make it, wondering why I survived when they didn't.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. I find myself constantly questioning why I'm here and they're not. Sometimes I catch myself feeling almost... ashamed to be alive? Which I know sounds ridiculous, but it's there. And then there's this constant need to justify my existence, to prove that I deserved to survive. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the moments before the crash. The sudden drop, the oxygen masks deploying, the panic... I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" And then, somehow, I didn't. Part of me still can't believe it. I find myself wondering if I could have done more to help others, if I should have reacted differently. There's this nagging voice that says I should have been braver, stronger. But then another part of me knows that's not fair. No one can truly prepare for something like that.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings affect your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they're always there, lurking in the background. Some days are better than others, but I'm always on edge. Loud noises make me jump, and I can't even think about getting on a plane without having a panic attack. I've been using alcohol more than I should to numb these feelings, which I know isn't healthy. It's affecting my work, my relationships... Sometimes I feel like I'm not really living, just... existing.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: I... wow, I hadn't even realized, but my muscles are so tense. Especially in my shoulders and jaw. I'm clenching my fists too. And my breathing... it's shallow and quick. It's like my body is still in that fight-or-flight mode, even though the danger has long passed. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, and there's this churning sensation in my stomach. It's amazing how powerful these physical reactions are, even just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: How does noticing these sensations impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's eye-opening, really. I hadn't fully appreciated how much my body was holding onto this trauma. It's like every cell remembers that day. But there's also something... I don't know, almost validating about it? Like, it's not just in my head. My whole being went through this traumatic experience, and these physical reactions are proof of that. It makes me realize that maybe I'm not overreacting or being weak. This is a normal response to an abnormal situation.",
    "Therapist: What feels most challenging for you right now?",
    "Client: The most challenging thing... I think it's the unpredictability of it all. I never know when something will trigger these memories and feelings. A sound, a smell, even a certain quality of light can suddenly transport me back to that moment. And it's not just the big things, like avoiding air travel. It's the small, everyday moments too. Like, I used to love thunderstorms, but now the rumble of thunder sends me into a panic. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, and I don't know if I'll ever get it back.",
    "Therapist: How does that loss feel to you?",
    "Client: It feels... profoundly sad. There's a grief there that I hadn't fully recognized before. I'm mourning not just for the people who died in the crash, but for the person I used to be. The carefree traveler, the adventure-seeker... that part of me feels like it's gone. And I'm angry too. Angry that this happened, angry that it's changed me so fundamentally. But beneath all that, there's also a tiny glimmer of hope. A part of me that wants to believe I can heal, that I can find a way to integrate this experience into my life without letting it define me.",
    "Therapist: What does that glimmer of hope mean to you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a lifeline, really. On my darkest days, it's what keeps me going. It reminds me that I've already survived the worst day of my life, so maybe I can survive this too. The hope tells me that maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to honor those who didn't make it by living my life fully. It's fragile, this hope, but it's there. And being here, talking about this, facing these memories and feelings... it's terrifying, but it also feels like I'm taking steps towards something better. Like maybe I'm not just a victim of this trauma, but a survivor who's fighting to reclaim their life.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that strength in yourself?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, to be honest. There's a sense of pride, I suppose. Like, \"Hey, I'm still here, I'm still fighting.\" But there's also this vulnerability that comes with it. Acknowledging my strength means also acknowledging how much this has affected me, how much I'm still struggling. It's humbling. And scary too, because what if I can't live up to it? What if I'm not as strong as I need to be? But overall, it feels... empowering. Like maybe I have more control over my recovery than I thought. It's a small shift, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: What do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need patience. With myself, primarily. I've been so hard on myself, expecting to just 'get over it'. But I'm realizing this is a process, and it's okay if it takes time. I need to keep pushing myself to face these memories and feelings, but also to be gentle with myself when it gets overwhelming. I need to find healthier ways to cope than turning to alcohol. And I think I need connection. This experience has left me feeling so isolated, but maybe opening up, like I am now, is part of the healing process. I need to remember that I'm not alone in this journey.",
    "Therapist: How can we support that in our work together?",
    "Client: I... I think continuing these conversations is important. Having a safe space to explore these memories and feelings without judgment. Maybe we could work on some coping strategies for when the memories hit unexpectedly? And... I think I need help reconnecting with parts of myself that I feel I've lost. Finding ways to engage with life again without constant fear. Perhaps we could set some small, achievable goals? And... I know it's a long way off, but maybe we could start talking about how I might eventually face flying again. Not now, but... someday. I don't want to let this fear control my life forever.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. I still feel shaky and a bit raw, but there's also a calmness that wasn't there before. It's like I've taken a small step forward. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. It's scary, but also... hopeful.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your support more than I can say. This isn't easy, but I'm grateful to have someone to guide me through it. I know there will be ups and downs, but right now, I feel a bit more equipped to face them. Thank you for creating this space where I can be vulnerable and honest about what I'm going through. It means a lot."
