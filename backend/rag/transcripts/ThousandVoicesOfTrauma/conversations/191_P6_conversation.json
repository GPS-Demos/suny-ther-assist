    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Just focus on the memory and describe it aloud.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the protest. It's a warm day, and there are so many people around me. We're chanting for justice, holding signs. I can smell sweat and hear the crowd's energy. Suddenly, I see police officers approaching. They're in full riot gear, and it's intimidating. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The officers start pushing people back. I'm trying to stay calm, but I can feel the tension rising. Someone next to me stumbles, and I reach out to help them. That's when I see an officer raise his baton. I freeze, unable to move. The baton comes down, and I feel a sharp pain in my shoulder. I cry out, but my voice is lost in the chaos...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My hands are shaking, and I can almost feel that pain again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I fall to the ground, clutching my shoulder. People are shouting and running around me. I'm scared and confused. An older woman tries to help me up, but another officer pushes her away. I feel so helpless, like I can't breathe. The tear gas starts, and my eyes burn. I'm coughing, struggling to see...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I manage to crawl away from the main crowd. My shoulder is throbbing, and I can taste blood in my mouth. I find a small alley and hide there, trembling. I can still hear the chaos, but it feels distant. I'm trying to call my husband, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely hold the phone. I feel so alone and terrified...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. My heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally reach my husband. He's panicked, trying to find me. I'm sobbing, trying to explain where I am. Everything hurts, and I'm so scared. I keep thinking about how quickly everything changed, how helpless I felt. I can't stop shaking...",

    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but also lighter somehow. Like I've released some of the tension I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today. Well done."
