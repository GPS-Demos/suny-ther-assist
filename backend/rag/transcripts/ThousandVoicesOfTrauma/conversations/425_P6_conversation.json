    "Therapist: Alright, Mar\u00eda. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I think so. I'm nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the airplane crash.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in my seat, feeling the plane shake. The turbulence is getting worse. I can hear people murmuring, sounding worried. My hands are gripping the armrests so tight, my knuckles are white. The plane suddenly drops, and I feel my stomach lurch. Oh Dios m\u00edo, I'm so scared...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down. Everyone's scrambling to put them on. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands are shaking so badly. The plane is tilting to one side, and I can hear the engines making a terrible noise. People are screaming now. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Mar\u00eda. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is so tight...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is falling fast now. I can see the ground through the window, coming closer and closer. I'm praying, begging for it to stop. The impact is so violent... I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. There's a deafening crash, and then... silence. Just the sound of my own ragged breathing and people sobbing.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't catch my breath. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Mar\u00eda. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands won't work properly. There's smoke filling the cabin. I can hear people coughing, crying for help. I finally get free and stumble into the aisle. It's chaos. Some seats are empty, others... I can't look. I need to get out...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard, I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mar\u00eda. Keep breathing. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm moving towards the emergency exit. My legs feel like jelly. I can barely walk. Someone pushes past me, nearly knocking me down. I grab onto a seat to steady myself. The door is jammed. People are panicking, pushing. I'm being crushed against the wall. I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10 now. I feel like I'm suffocating. My chest hurts so much...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Mar\u00eda. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: I... I know. But it feels so real. Someone finally gets the door open. We're spilling out onto the wing. The heat from the engines is intense. I can see flames. People are jumping off the wing. I'm frozen, I can't move. Someone grabs my arm, pulls me. We jump together. I hit the ground hard, roll... and then I'm just lying there, in shock.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8? I still feel shaky, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done an excellent job, Mar\u00eda. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a little relieved, I think. Like I've faced something I've been running from for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Gracias. I never thought I could do this. It was so hard, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session."
