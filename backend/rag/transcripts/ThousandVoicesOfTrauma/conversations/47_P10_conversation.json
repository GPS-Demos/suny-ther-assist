    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is doing somersaults.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the Humvee. The air is thick with dust, and I can taste it on my tongue. We're driving through a village, and everything seems too quiet.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The weight of my gear. It's heavy, and I'm sweating underneath. My hands are clammy on my weapon. I keep scanning the windows of the buildings we pass.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 5? I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: We're slowing down. There's... there's a checkpoint ahead. I can see some locals gathered, but something feels off. My squad leader is talking to the driver, but I can't hear what they're saying over the engine.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I'm trying to stay alert, but it's like my body knows something's wrong before my mind does. Oh god...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's happening now?",
    "Client: There's a flash. A deafening boom. The Humvee in front of us... it's gone. Just... gone. And there's screaming. So much screaming.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Eight... maybe nine. It's... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Y-yes. I can feel it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: We're under attack. I can hear bullets pinging off the Humvee. Someone's yelling to dismount. I'm moving, but it feels like slow motion. My training kicks in, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I take cover behind the Humvee. I'm returning fire, but I can barely see where it's coming from. There's so much chaos. I see one of my teammates go down. There's blood... so much blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. I'm thinking about home, about my family. I don't want to die here. But I have to keep fighting. I have to protect my team.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a solid 9. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I'm moving forward. We're trying to flank the attackers. I can smell the gunpowder, the burning vehicles. There's a ringing in my ears from the explosions. I see movement and I fire. I... I think I hit someone. Oh god, I hit someone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Horror. But also... relief? Because if I hadn't... it could have been me or one of my teammates. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever. We're calling for air support, but it feels like it's taking too long. I'm running low on ammo. I can hear someone calling for a medic. I want to help, but I can't move from my position.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm praying. I've never been very religious, but I'm begging for this to end. For all of us to make it out alive. But I know... I know some of us won't.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing great, Sarah.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Finally, we hear the choppers. The sound... it's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. They start laying down suppressing fire, and we're able to start pulling back.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We're evacuating. I'm helping carry one of the wounded. His blood is soaking through my uniform. I can feel how warm it is. We're loading up into the rescue choppers. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're almost through it. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Numb. As we lift off, I look down at the village. It's... it's devastated. Smoke everywhere. And I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to such intense experiences. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? I'm still shaky, but the worst of it has passed.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Sarah. Let's start bringing you back to the present. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the window, the clock, the bookshelf, and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my necklace, and... and the tissue in my hand.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The air conditioning, traffic outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Two things you smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: Last one. One thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... the dryness in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Drained, but okay. It's like... it's like I left something behind in that memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal feeling after an intense session like this. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Down to a 4, I think. I'm surprised it dropped so much.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How was this experience for you overall?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... I feel like I faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's... it's a relief, in a way.",
    "Therapist: You showed immense courage today, Sarah. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous about doing it again, but I can see how it might help. It's like... it's like lancing a wound. It hurts, but it's the only way to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a great analogy. We'll take it step by step. For now, what do you need to feel grounded before you leave?",
    "Client: Could we just... sit quietly for a moment? I need to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready to go now. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, Sarah. I'm proud of you. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. And don't hesitate to call if you need support.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
