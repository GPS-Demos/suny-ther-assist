    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. Let's begin our session. Can you tell me about the home invasion incident?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult to talk about. I was asleep when I heard a noise downstairs. At first, I thought it might be my cat, but then I heard footsteps. I froze in my bed, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take your time.",
    "Client: I... I could hear them moving around downstairs. The creaking of the floorboards seemed so loud in the silence. I wanted to call for help, but I was terrified they'd hear me. I felt so helpless, like a child again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember clutching my blanket, trying to make myself as small as possible. The footsteps started coming up the stairs, and I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" I could barely breathe. Each step they took felt like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you recall?",
    "Client: The door handle to my bedroom started to turn. I wanted to scream, but no sound would come out. It was like my voice was trapped in my throat. When the door opened, I saw a silhouette of a man. He was tall, much bigger than me. I felt so vulnerable, so exposed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He came closer to the bed. I could smell cigarette smoke on him. It made me feel sick. I closed my eyes, pretending to be asleep, hoping he'd just take what he wanted and leave. But then... then he touched my arm.",
    "Therapist: I know this is hard. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: His hand was rough, calloused. I flinched, and he knew I was awake. He said, \"Don't move, or I'll hurt you.\" His voice was gravelly, threatening. I nodded, tears streaming down my face. I felt so ashamed, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have felt that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: He rummaged through my jewelry box, taking the few valuable pieces I had. All I could think about was my children, how they'd cope if something happened to me. I wanted to fight back, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After what felt like hours, but was probably only minutes, he left. I heard him go downstairs and then the sound of the front door closing. I lay there, shaking, for what seemed like forever before I could move to call the police.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. It's like a weight has been lifted, sharing this. But I still feel the fear, the helplessness. Will I ever feel safe in my own home again?",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress.",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... I keep replaying that night in my head. The sounds, the smells, the fear. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I hear footsteps again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, but... maybe there's hope. I just want to feel normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. There's more I want to share about that night, about how it's affected me since. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Go ahead when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. Well, after he left, I couldn't bring myself to move for the longest time. I kept thinking he might come back. When I finally called the police, my hands were shaking so badly I could barely dial the number..."
