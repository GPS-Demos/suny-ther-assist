    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Are you ready to revisit the memory of losing your loved one?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I'm at the hospital. It's late at night, and the halls are quiet. I can smell the disinfectant and hear the faint beeping of machines. I'm sitting outside my grandmother's room, waiting for news. The doctor comes out, and I can tell by his face that it's not good.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He tells me that her condition has worsened and that we should prepare for the worst. I feel like the floor is dropping out from under me. I can't breathe. I want to run away, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to panic.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm trying. The doctor is still talking, but I can barely hear him over the rushing in my ears. I nod mechanically, but inside, I'm screaming. I want to beg him to do something, anything to save her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally manage to stumble into her room. She looks so small and frail in the hospital bed. The machines are beeping slower now. I take her hand, and it's cold. I want to say something, but my throat is closing up. I just sit there, holding her hand, watching her slip away.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Like there's a void inside me that's growing larger by the second. I know I should be crying, but I can't. I'm just numb.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The machines start to flatline. The sound is deafening in the quiet room. Nurses rush in, but I know it's too late. I'm pushed aside as they try to resuscitate her, but I can see in their eyes that it's futile. I watch as they pronounce her time of death. 2:37 AM. I'll never forget that time.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After they leave, I'm alone with her. I finally break down. I'm sobbing, clutching her hand, begging her to come back. But she's gone. I feel so lost, so alone. I can't imagine a world without her in it. The pain is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that pain. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I stay there, crying. Eventually, a nurse comes in and gently tells me I need to leave. I don't want to go. Leaving means it's real, that she's really gone. But I have to. I kiss her forehead one last time and whisper goodbye. As I walk out of the hospital, the world feels different. Colder. Emptier. I feel like a part of me died with her that night.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But also, there's a strange sense of relief. Like I've been holding my breath for a long time and I can finally exhale.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but I think it helped. Can we... can we end here for today? I feel like I need some time to process this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made significant progress. We'll continue next session."
