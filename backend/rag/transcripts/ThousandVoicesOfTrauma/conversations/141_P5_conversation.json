    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having trouble sleeping, thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we've planned.",
    "Client: Right, yeah. I've been wondering about that. What exactly does it involve? I mean, I know we've talked about it before, but now that we're here... it feels more real, you know?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process your trauma. We'll revisit the event in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit it? You mean... I have to talk about what happened? In detail? I'm not sure I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is normal. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. But why do we need to do this? Can't we just... I don't know, talk about how to move forward instead?",
    "Therapist: Facing the memory can reduce its power over you. It's a key step in healing.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... I've spent so long trying to forget. The idea of purposely remembering is... it's terrifying, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is valid. Remember, you're in control here. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That helps, knowing I can stop if it gets too much. What should I expect to feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions or physical reactions. This is normal and will pass.",
    "Client: Strong emotions... yeah, I can imagine. Will this make my nightmares worse? I'm already struggling with those.",
    "Therapist: Initially, symptoms might intensify. But over time, this process often reduces nightmares.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's been affecting my work, my relationships... everything, really. How long will this take?",
    "Therapist: The duration varies for each person. We'll work through this at your own pace.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm still scared, but I want to get better. I'm tired of letting this control my life. What do I need to do?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll start by focusing on a specific memory.",
    "Client: A specific memory... there are so many. How do I choose? They all seem equally horrible.",
    "Therapist: We can start with the one that troubles you most frequently.",
    "Client: I suppose that would be... the first time it happened. Just thinking about it makes me feel sick.",
    "Therapist: That's a good starting point. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Safe... right. It's hard to feel safe anywhere these days. But I trust you, Dr. Thompson. You've been patient with me.",
    "Therapist: I'm here to support you. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. Just... please don't judge me, okay?",
    "Therapist: There's no judgment here, John. Only support and understanding.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. Okay... I'm ready. Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes and recalling that day. Describe what you see."
