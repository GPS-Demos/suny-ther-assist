    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the incident with the police?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a warm evening, and I was walking home from the grocery store. I remember feeling content, carrying my bag of fruits and vegetables. Suddenly, I heard shouting behind me. Before I could turn around, I felt a strong grip on my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: It was a police officer. He spun me around roughly, causing me to drop my groceries. I was confused and scared. He started yelling at me, asking what I was doing in the neighborhood. I tried to explain that I lived nearby, but he wouldn't listen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... humiliated. Angry. Scared. My heart was racing, and I could feel my face getting hot. I kept thinking, \"Why me? What did I do wrong?\" The officer's face was so close to mine, I could smell coffee on his breath.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He demanded to see my ID. My hands were shaking as I reached for my wallet. I remember thinking, \"Please don't mistake this for a weapon.\" As I handed him my ID, I noticed other people walking by, staring at us. I felt so ashamed, like I was being put on display.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The officer scrutinized my ID for what felt like an eternity. Then, without apologizing, he handed it back and told me to \"move along.\" I tried to gather my scattered groceries, but some had rolled into the street. I... I just left them there. I couldn't bear to stay any longer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you feel as you walked away?",
    "Client: I felt... broken. Like my dignity had been stripped away. I was angry at the officer, at the system, at myself for not standing up more. But mostly, I felt fear. Fear that it could happen again at any moment, just for existing in my own neighborhood.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about. Even now, I can feel my heart racing, just like it did that day. I keep replaying it in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently. But I know I didn't do anything wrong. I was just... existing.",
    "Therapist: You're right. It wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. Since then, I've been anxious every time I see a police car. I've changed my walking routes, I avoid going out at night. It's like I'm a prisoner in my own neighborhood. And the worst part is, I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it. Who would understand?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'm overreacting. But then I remember the fear in that moment, the helplessness. It's not just about that one incident. It's about feeling like I don't belong, like I'm always under suspicion. How do I move past this?",
    "Therapist: It's a process. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to feel safe again, to not flinch every time I see a uniform. I want to be able to walk in my neighborhood without fear. But right now, it feels impossible. That incident... it changed something in me. It's like a constant weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Let's continue exploring these feelings.",
    "Client: Okay. I think what hurts the most is the loss of trust. I always believed that police were there to protect everyone. But now, I feel like they're a threat. It's a lonely feeling, like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was. And at my age, it's hard to reshape my entire worldview.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. Talking about it brings back all those emotions. But also... a little lighter? Like sharing the burden has helped somewhat. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe there's hope for healing. I just want to feel whole again.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you for listening. It means more than you know."
