    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the day of the natural disaster. Start describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's early morning, and I can hear the wind howling outside. The trees are swaying violently, and I can see debris flying past my window. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. I'm... I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. It's pretty intense, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The power just went out. It's dark, and I can hear my parents arguing downstairs about what to do. The noise outside is getting louder, and I can hear things crashing. I'm... I'm starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My anxiety is definitely increasing. I feel like I can't breathe properly. It's like there's a weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Remember to take deep breaths. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can hear screaming from outside now. Someone's calling for help. I want to do something, but I'm frozen. I can't move. My legs feel like jelly, and I'm sweating all over. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening next?",
    "Client: There's a loud crash, and I see a tree fall through our neighbor's roof. I'm watching it happen, and I can't do anything. I feel sick to my stomach. My hands are shaking so much.",
    "Therapist: Check in with your SUDS.",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. This is really intense. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I see people running outside. They look terrified. I want to look away, but I can't. My heart is pounding so hard it hurts. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: How are your emotions right now?",
    "Client: I'm overwhelmed with fear and guilt. I feel like I should be doing something to help, but I'm paralyzed. My throat feels tight, and I'm struggling to swallow.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. Maybe... maybe even a 9.5. This is really tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The wind is so loud now, it's deafening. I can hear glass breaking somewhere. I'm curled up in a ball on my bed, trying to make myself as small as possible. I'm shaking uncontrollably, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear my mom calling for me. She sounds panicked. I want to answer, but I can't find my voice. My mouth is dry, and my tongue feels swollen. I'm so scared something's happened to her.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. But... I think I can feel it starting to come down a little. Maybe an 8.5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I finally manage to get up and go downstairs. Everything's a mess. There's water coming in from somewhere, and I can hear things breaking outside. But my family is all here, safe. We're huddled together in the hallway. I'm still shaking, but I feel a little less alone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to calm down a bit. My heart isn't racing as much. I can breathe a little easier. The fear is still there, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. It's still high, but I feel like I can manage it better.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. As I open my eyes, I can feel myself coming back to the room. My breathing is steadier now, and the shaking has mostly stopped. I feel... drained, but also a bit relieved.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now that we're finished?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but I also feel a sense of accomplishment. It was really hard to go through that again, but I did it. My SUDS is probably around a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. How was this experience for you?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I think it was helpful. I feel like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's like... I can look at the memory now without being completely overwhelmed by it.",
