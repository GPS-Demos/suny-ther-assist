    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about diving into this memory.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you give me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. When you're ready, describe the airplane crash scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the airport, waiting for my flight. Everything seemed normal at first. Then... there was this loud noise. I looked out the window and saw a plane coming in too fast. It hit the runway hard, and... and then there was fire everywhere.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can almost smell the smoke again. It's... it's getting more intense.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's up to a 6, maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: People were screaming, running everywhere. I couldn't move. I just stood there, watching. The plane... it broke apart. I saw people... bodies... I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's like I'm back there. My palms are sweating. I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. God, it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I remember the heat. Even from inside, I could feel it. And the smell... burning fuel, melting plastic. It was suffocating. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed. People were crying, praying... I've never felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I feel nauseous. But... but it's not as bad as before. Maybe... maybe a 7 now?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it.",
    "Client: Yeah... I... I remember security rushing in, trying to keep people back. Ambulances, fire trucks... their sirens were deafening. But all I could focus on was the plane. It was surreal, like a movie, but... but it was real. So terribly real.",
    "Therapist: And now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. I'm still shaky, but... but I can breathe easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I remember sitting down eventually. Someone gave me water. I couldn't stop staring at the scene. Hours passed, but it felt like minutes. I kept thinking about the people on that plane, their families... It was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Sad. Really, really sad. But... but not as panicked. Maybe a 4 on the SUDS scale?",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks... I... I've never talked about it in this much detail before. It's hard, but... but I feel like I'm finally facing it.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what we're aiming for. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a bit lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... a 3. I'm tired, but calmer.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, James. We'll end here and discuss more next time."
