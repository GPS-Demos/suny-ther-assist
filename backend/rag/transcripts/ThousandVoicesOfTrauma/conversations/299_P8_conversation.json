    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see the room, you know? The dimly lit space where we'd gather for those... those meetings. The air always felt heavy, like it was pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Mhm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't get a full breath. It's how I used to feel during those meetings, always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"I should have known better.\" I was an adult when I joined, for crying out loud. How could I have been so naive? But then, I remember how lost I was after my divorce. They promised community, purpose... It seemed like the answer to everything.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with a lot of complex emotions.",
    "Client: Yeah, I am. There's anger, definitely. Anger at them for manipulating me, but also anger at myself for falling for it. And shame. So much shame. I look back at some of the things I did, the people I cut out of my life because the group told me to... It makes me sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Fear. Even though I've been out for years, there's still this nagging fear that they'll find me, try to pull me back in. Or that I'll run into someone from the group and... I don't know, lose myself again? It's irrational, I know, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first left the group?",
    "Client: They're... less intense, I suppose. When I first left, it was like my whole world had shattered. I couldn't trust my own judgment, couldn't make the simplest decisions without second-guessing myself. Now, it's more like... a dull ache. Always there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. What helps you manage these feelings now?",
    "Client: Honestly? This therapy. Talking about it, facing it head-on instead of trying to bury it. And my work, oddly enough. Throwing myself into my career, proving to myself that I can succeed on my own terms... it's been healing in its own way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it feel to recognize that progress?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, I guess? But also scary. Like, what if I'm just fooling myself again? What if I'm not really as far along as I think I am?",
    "Therapist: Those doubts are understandable. What evidence do you have of your progress?",
    "Client: Well, I have a stable job now. I've reconnected with some old friends, even though it was terrifying at first. And I can talk about my experiences without completely falling apart. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are significant achievements.",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose they are. It's just... sometimes I feel like I lost so much time, you know? Like those years in the cult were just... wasted. And I can't get them back.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that feeling of lost time?",
    "Client: I try to focus on the present, on building a life I'm proud of now. But it's hard. Sometimes I look at my peers, see how far they've come in their careers or relationships, and I feel so far behind. It's like I'm playing catch-up in my 50s.",
    "Therapist: That sounds frustrating. What helps you stay motivated?",
    "Client: Reminding myself that everyone's journey is different, I guess. And that I have skills and perspectives now that I wouldn't have had otherwise. It's a double-edged sword, you know? The experience was traumatic, but it also taught me a lot about human nature, about resilience.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful perspective. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, in a way. Like, maybe I can use this experience for something good. Maybe I can help others who've been through similar things. It doesn't erase the pain or the lost time, but it gives it some meaning, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it impact your view of the future?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... cautiously optimistic, I suppose. Like maybe there's still time to build the life I want, to make a difference. But there's still that voice in the back of my head, you know? The one that says I'm kidding myself, that I'll never really recover.",
    "Therapist: How do you respond to that voice?",
    "Client: I try to challenge it. To remind myself of how far I've come, of the progress we've talked about in these sessions. Some days it's easier than others. But I'm getting better at recognizing it for what it is - just a voice, not the truth.",
    "Therapist: That's an important skill. What else helps you stay grounded in the present?",
    "Client: My routines, I think. Having a structured day, taking care of myself... it helps me feel in control. And mindfulness exercises, as cheesy as they sometimes feel. Just taking a moment to breathe, to really notice where I am and what I'm doing... it helps pull me out of those spiraling thoughts.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent coping strategies. How do you feel now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: More... settled, I guess? The memories are still there, still painful. But talking about them, really facing them... it makes them feel less overwhelming. Like maybe I can carry this experience without being crushed by it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. Can you expand on that?",
    "Client: It's like... before, the memories were this huge, unwieldy thing that I was desperately trying to hide or run from. But now, it's more like... a heavy backpack, maybe? Still there, still affecting me, but something I can carry and even use. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does that shift in perspective affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel stronger, I think. More capable. Like maybe I'm not just a victim of my past, but someone who can learn from it, grow from it. It's still hard, still painful. But it feels... manageable now. Like I have some control over how it affects me.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How do you want to build on this?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep exploring these memories, as hard as it is. And maybe start thinking about how I can use my experience to help others. Not right away, I don't think I'm ready for that yet. But someday. It feels like a way to reclaim some of what I lost, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Tired, definitely. These sessions always take a lot out of me. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've put down a little bit of the weight I've been carrying. Thank you for this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage in facing these memories is commendable. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next time."
