    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you share your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay, um... I'd say it's about a 4 right now. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's start. Describe the scene for me.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital. The lights are so bright, and there's this constant beeping from the machines. My husband is lying in the bed, he looks so pale and weak. The doctors just told us his condition is critical. I can feel my heart racing, and my palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. I can feel the tension in my shoulders, and my throat feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor is explaining something about organ failure, but I can barely focus. All I can think about is how scared I am of losing him. I'm trying to be strong, but inside I'm falling apart. I keep glancing at the monitors, willing them to show better numbers.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My chest feels so tight, like I can't breathe properly. I'm reliving that helpless feeling, knowing there's nothing I can do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I remember holding his hand. It felt so cold. A nurse came in to adjust something, and for a moment, I thought... I thought we were going to lose him right then. I started praying, pleading with God to save him. The fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember the long hours of waiting, the uncertainty. Every time a doctor walked by, my heart would jump. The smell of disinfectant was so strong, it made me dizzy. I kept thinking about our children at home, not knowing if their father would...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm still anxious, but talking about it... it's helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: As the night went on, I found myself lost in memories. Our wedding day, the birth of our kids... I was terrified that these might be the last memories we'd share. But then, early in the morning, the doctor came with good news. My husband's vitals had stabilized. I felt this rush of relief, but also exhaustion. It was like I'd been holding my breath for hours and could finally exhale.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I still feel shaky, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe gratitude? That we made it through.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: I'm surprised. It was intense, but... I feel a bit lighter. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I think I'm starting to see how this process might help."
