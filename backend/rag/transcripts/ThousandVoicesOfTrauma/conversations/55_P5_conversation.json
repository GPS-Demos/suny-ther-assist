    "Therapist: Mrs. Johnson, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that terrible day when the hurricane hit... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I've spent so long trying to forget, and now you're asking me to remember? It feels counterintuitive and, frankly, a bit scary.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is completely normal. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that talking about it will make things worse. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? I've worked so hard to keep myself together for my family. And... I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I'm afraid of appearing weak in front of you.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. Your strength is evident in facing this. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think... I think I just need to know that it's okay if I get overwhelmed. And maybe some reassurance that this will actually help? It's hard to believe that reliving such a traumatic experience could be beneficial.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. This process, while challenging, aims to reduce your PTSD symptoms. Shall we discuss how?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to understand the reasoning behind this approach. It seems so counterintuitive to deliberately revisit something I've been trying to avoid for so long.",
    "Therapist: The exposure helps process the memory, reducing its power over time. It may be difficult initially, but often leads to relief. What are your thoughts?",
    "Client: I see. It's like facing a fear head-on instead of running from it. It makes sense, but it's still daunting. Will you guide me through it? I'm not sure I can do this alone.",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'll be here throughout, offering support and guidance. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I think I can handle it knowing you'll be there. Can you tell me what to expect? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you ask me questions? I'm trying to prepare myself mentally for what's to come.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in present tense, eyes closed if comfortable. I'll ask occasional questions. We can pause anytime. How's that?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I understand. The present tense part might be challenging \u2013 it's been years since the hurricane. But I'll do my best. Is it normal to feel physically uncomfortable during this? Sometimes when I think about that day, I get nauseous or shaky.",
    "Therapist: Physical reactions are common. We'll monitor your distress and take breaks if needed. Your safety is priority. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful that this might help. It would be wonderful to not feel so haunted by these memories. Before we start, is there anything I should do to prepare? Any breathing exercises or anything like that?",
    "Therapist: Great question. Let's do a quick grounding exercise. Focus on your breath and surroundings. How does that feel?",
    "Client: That helps, thank you. It reminds me that I'm here, safe, in the present. Not back there in the storm. Okay, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're in control. We'll start gently. Close your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright, my eyes are closed. My heart's pounding a bit, but I'm okay. I'm thinking about that morning, before we knew how bad it would be. It was so quiet..."
