    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my apartment, studying for my finals. It was late, maybe around 11 PM. I remember feeling tired but pushing myself to keep going. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from the living room. At first, I thought maybe I'd left a window open and something fell, but then I heard footsteps. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, not sure what to do. Then I heard a man's voice, rough and angry, saying something about finding valuables. I realized someone had broken in. I was terrified. I quietly got up and locked my bedroom door, then grabbed my phone to call the police. My hands were shaking so much I could barely dial...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... panic. Pure panic. My chest was tight, I could hardly breathe. I was trying to whisper to the emergency operator, but I was so scared they'd hear me. I kept thinking about what would happen if they broke down my door. Would they hurt me? Kill me? I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: Thank you... It's hard to talk about. While I was on the phone, I heard them ransacking the living room. Things were crashing and breaking. I remembered thinking about all my belongings, my laptop with all my work on it. But mostly, I was just praying they wouldn't try to come into my room.",
    "Therapist: How long did this go on?",
    "Client: It felt like hours, but it was probably only about 15 minutes. I heard sirens in the distance, and then the intruders started cursing and running. There was more crashing, and then I heard the front door slam. Even after that, I was too scared to leave my room. I just sat there, shaking and crying, until the police arrived and called out to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: When I finally opened the door, I saw the destruction. My living room was a mess, things thrown everywhere. My TV and some other electronics were gone. But what really got to me was seeing my family photos smashed on the floor. It made me feel... violated. Like they hadn't just invaded my home, but my life, my memories.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. How did you cope in the following days?",
    "Client: It was awful. I couldn't sleep for days. Every little noise made me jump. I kept replaying that night in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. Should I have tried to escape? What if I had confronted them? I know that's ridiculous, but I couldn't stop the thoughts. I felt so unsafe in my own home. I ended up staying with a friend for a while because I just couldn't be there alone.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those thoughts. You're processing the experience.",
    "Client: I guess... But it's been months now, and I still get anxious when I'm home alone. I've installed better locks and an alarm system, but I can't shake the feeling that it could happen again. Sometimes I have nightmares about it, where I'm trapped in my room and they're trying to break down the door. I wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well facing these memories. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My palms are sweaty, and my heart is racing a bit. But... I also feel a little relieved to be talking about it. It's like a weight I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you... It's hard, but I want to get better. I don't want to live in fear anymore. Sometimes I feel angry, too. Angry that they took away my sense of safety, that they made me feel so vulnerable in my own home. Is it okay to feel angry?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anger is a natural response to what you experienced.",
    "Client: I'm glad you said that. I've been trying to push the anger down, thinking it wasn't helpful. But maybe acknowledging it is part of healing? It's just... sometimes I feel overwhelmed by all these emotions. The fear, the anger, the helplessness. How do I deal with all of that?",
    "Therapist: It's part of the process. We'll work through these emotions together.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe again. Will I always be looking over my shoulder? Always expecting the worst? I want to be able to relax in my own home, to not panic every time I hear an unexpected noise. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It is possible. We'll work towards that goal together.",
    "Client: That gives me hope. I want to be able to move past this, to not let this experience define me. But it's hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, and then something will trigger me - a loud noise, or being alone at night - and I'm right back there, feeling terrified and helpless. How do I break out of that cycle?",
    "Therapist: We'll develop coping strategies to help you manage those moments.",
    "Client: That sounds good. I'm willing to try anything at this point. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? To be able to focus on my studies without constantly being on edge. To be able to enjoy simple things like watching a movie at home without worrying about every little sound. It's exhausting being this vigilant all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... a mix of things. Still a bit anxious from talking about the experience, but also a little lighter. Like maybe there's a way forward. It's scary to confront these memories and feelings, but I think I needed to do it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's wrap up and discuss next steps."
