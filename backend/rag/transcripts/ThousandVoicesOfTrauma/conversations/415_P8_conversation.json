    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's as if I'm right back there in the hospital room, hearing the doctor's words all over again. The fluorescent lights, the antiseptic smell... it's all so vivid. My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the doctor's voice saying, \"I'm sorry, but it's cancer.\" And then... then I see my son's face when I told him. He tried to be strong, but I could see the fear in his eyes. I feel so... so helpless. Like I've failed him somehow by getting sick. And angry too, I suppose. Why me? Why now, when I should be enjoying my retirement?",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a burning in my stomach. My fists are clenched, and I want to scream or throw something. But then I remember how my parents taught me to always be polite and composed, and I feel guilty for even having these feelings. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part of this memory for you?",
    "Client: The hardest part... I think it's the loss of control. One minute I was planning a trip to visit my sister in India, and the next, my whole world was turned upside down. I've always been the one taking care of others, you know? My parents, my son... and suddenly, I was the one needing care. It made me feel so vulnerable and... and old.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that vulnerability make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit liberating, in a strange way. I've spent so much time trying to be strong for everyone else. But maybe... maybe it's okay to need help sometimes. I just worry that if I let my guard down, I'll fall apart completely.",
    "Therapist: What do you think would happen if you did?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me thinks it would be a relief, to just let go of all this tension I've been carrying. But another part is terrified. What if I can't pull myself back together? What if my family sees me as weak or burdensome? In our culture, we're supposed to bear our troubles with dignity.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your view of yourself?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I used to see myself as this strong, independent woman. Now, I feel more fragile. But also... maybe more human? I've realized that I'm not invincible, and that's been humbling. I think I'm more empathetic now, especially towards others dealing with illness or hardship.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this?",
    "Client: I've learned that I'm more resilient than I thought. Even on my worst days, when the treatment made me so sick I could barely move, I found the strength to keep going. And I've learned to appreciate the small things - a cup of chai, a phone call from a friend, the warmth of sunlight on my face. It's bittersweet, but I think I value life more now.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like maybe all this pain and fear hasn't been for nothing. But it also makes me sad, thinking about all the time I wasted worrying about trivial things before. I wish I had known then what I know now about what really matters.",
    "Therapist: What matters most to you now?",
    "Client: My relationships, definitely. My son, my parents, my friends... I've realized how precious they are. And my own peace of mind. I'm trying to let go of old grudges and expectations. It's not easy, especially with how I was raised, but I'm working on it. And I want to make a difference, somehow. Maybe by sharing my story with others going through similar struggles.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that future make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... hopeful, I suppose. A bit scary too. Opening up like that isn't something I'm used to. But if I can help even one person feel less alone in their journey, maybe all this pain will have some meaning. And it gives me a sense of purpose, you know? Something to focus on beyond just surviving.",
    "Therapist: What's one step you could take towards that goal?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about volunteering at the cancer support center where I used to go for group therapy. Maybe I could talk to the coordinator about sharing my story or mentoring newly diagnosed patients. It's a small step, but it feels like something I could manage.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. It's still hard to talk about all this, but I think it's getting easier. And I appreciate how you listen without judgment. It helps me feel safe to explore these difficult emotions.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on managing my anxiety about the future. Even though I'm in remission now, I still worry constantly about the cancer coming back. It's affecting my sleep and my relationships. I'd like to find some ways to cope with that fear.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good focus. We'll explore that next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I'm looking forward to it. And... thank you for helping me through this. I know I'm not always the easiest patient, but I truly appreciate your guidance.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Mrs. Patel."
