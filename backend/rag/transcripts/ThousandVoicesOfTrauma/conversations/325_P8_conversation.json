    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of witnessing that violence, it's so vivid now. I can see every detail, hear every sound. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that I had to witness something so horrible. And I'm angry at myself for not being able to do anything about it. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something? Why was I so helpless?\" It's frustrating.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a burning sensation in my stomach. My fists are clenched, and my jaw feels tight. I want to scream or punch something, but I also feel paralyzed. It's such a confusing mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you sit with these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the scene in my head. I'm thinking about how unfair it all is. Why did I have to see that? Why couldn't I have done something to stop it? And then... then I start thinking about my relationship, my impending divorce. It's like, is this why I'm struggling so much with my marriage? Did witnessing that violence somehow... I don't know, break something inside me?",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences connecting?",
    "Client: I... I guess I've always struggled with feeling powerless since that day. In my marriage, I often felt like I couldn't speak up or stand up for myself. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always on edge, always expecting the worst. And now that my marriage is ending, it feels like I'm reliving that helplessness all over again.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you make that connection?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I... I actually feel a bit of relief. Like a weight lifting off my chest. It's like... maybe understanding this connection gives me some control back? I'm still scared and angry, but there's this tiny glimmer of hope. Like maybe if I can process this trauma, I can regain some of that power I've been missing.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does it feel to recognize that potential for change?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. Part of me wants to run away from all of this, to just ignore it and pretend everything's fine. But another part of me is so tired of feeling this way. I want to feel strong again, to feel like I have control over my life. It's just... it's going to be a long, hard journey, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: What support do you need on this journey?",
    "Client: I think... I need people who understand. Who won't judge me for the mess of emotions I'm dealing with. I need patience, both from others and from myself. And I need... I need hope. Hope that things can get better, that I can heal from this. It's hard to see that sometimes, you know?",
    "Therapist: How can we nurture that hope in our sessions?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by celebrating small victories? Like today, being able to sit through that memory without completely falling apart. That's progress, right? And maybe by setting small, achievable goals. I don't know exactly what those would look like, but I think having concrete steps to work towards might help me feel less overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. What else came up for you during the exercise?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much I've been isolating myself. Not just because of the divorce, but because of this underlying fear and anxiety from the trauma. I've been pushing people away, afraid to let anyone get too close. But going through this exercise, reliving that memory... it made me realize how much I crave connection. How much I need support right now.",
    "Therapist: How might you start to rebuild those connections?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's scary to think about opening up to people. But maybe I could start small? Like, reaching out to an old friend for coffee. Or maybe joining a support group for people going through divorce. Just... baby steps, I guess. It's hard to imagine being vulnerable with others when I feel so raw and exposed.",
    "Therapist: What strengths can you draw on as you take those steps?",
    "Client: Hmm... I guess I'm pretty resilient. I mean, I've survived this trauma, and I'm here, trying to work through it. That takes strength, right? And I'm... I'm empathetic. Maybe that'll help me connect with others who are struggling. Oh, and I'm determined. Once I set my mind to something, I usually follow through. So if I commit to this healing process, I think I can stick with it, even when it gets tough.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful strengths. How do you feel as we wrap up today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... hopeful? Like, for the first time in a long time, I can see a path forward. It's still hazy and intimidating, but it's there. I'm grateful for this space to explore all of these emotions and memories. It's painful, but... I think it's necessary. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next time."
