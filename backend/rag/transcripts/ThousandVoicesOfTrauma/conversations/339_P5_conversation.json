    "Therapist: Welcome, Ms. Chen. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that airplane crash... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having more nightmares lately. Just thinking about the crash makes my heart race. I'm worried that talking about it will make everything worse. And... I'm not sure I can handle reliving those moments.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. It's a crucial step in your recovery.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It involves recounting the traumatic event in detail. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it. The screams, the chaos... it's all so vivid. How is reliving it supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: It helps by processing the memory safely. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I have so many. Will I have to close my eyes? What if I panic? How long will it last? And... will you be there the whole time? I'm not sure I can do this alone.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We'll go at your pace. What else worries you?",
    "Client: I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't stop crying? Or what if I freeze up and can't speak at all? And... I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I'm concerned about how you'll perceive me. Will you think less of me if I fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. I'm here to support, not judge. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help. I've been practicing those breathing exercises you taught me, but I'm not sure if they'll be enough for this. Do you have any other techniques that might help me stay grounded during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Great. Let's review grounding techniques and create a safety plan together.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate your patience with me. I know this is important for my recovery, but it's just so hard to face. Can you tell me a bit more about what to expect during the actual exposure? How detailed do I need to be?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. Be as detailed as possible. How does that feel?",
    "Client: That feels... daunting. The present tense part especially. It's like I'll be right back there again. But I suppose that's the point, isn't it? To face it head-on? I'm trying to be brave, but I'm scared of how I'll react.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we start with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be helpful. I can feel my anxiety rising just thinking about it. A relaxation exercise might help me feel more centered. And... thank you for acknowledging my effort. Sometimes I feel like I'm not making progress, but hearing you say that... it means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's begin the relaxation exercise. Close your eyes if comfortable..."
