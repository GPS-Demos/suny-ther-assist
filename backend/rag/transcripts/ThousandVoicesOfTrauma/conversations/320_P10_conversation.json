    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40. It's not terrible, but I can feel the anxiety building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking down the street. It's a sunny afternoon, warm. I can hear traffic, people talking. I'm on my way to meet a friend for coffee. Everything seems normal, you know? Just an ordinary day.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching the intersection. The light's green for me, so I start to cross. Then I hear... oh God, I hear tires screeching. It's so loud. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I can barely breathe. I turn my head and I see this car... it's coming so fast. The driver, he looks... he looks terrified.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you see next?",
    "Client: The car, it's swerving. People are shouting, jumping out of the way. But there's this woman... she's not moving fast enough. Oh God, I can see what's about to happen.",
    "Therapist: Stay present in the memory. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm frozen. I want to yell, to warn her, but no sound comes out. My legs won't move. I'm just... watching. The car hits her. There's this horrible thud, and she... she flies through the air.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel sick. My hands are shaking. It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep breathing. What happens after the impact?",
    "Client: Everything seems to slow down. The woman lands on the pavement. She's not moving. There's blood... so much blood. People are screaming, running towards her. The driver, he's stumbling out of the car, looking shocked.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm finally moving. My legs feel like lead, but I'm walking towards her. Someone's calling 911. I kneel down next to her, but I don't know what to do. Her eyes are open, but they're... empty.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. I feel so helpless, so useless. Why couldn't I do something? Why didn't I react faster?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is a memory. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 90. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics rush over. They're working on her, but I can tell... I can tell it's too late. One of them looks at me, asks if I'm okay. I nod, but I'm not okay. Nothing's okay.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body now?",
    "Client: I feel numb. Like I'm disconnected from everything. But my hands are still shaking. I can't stop staring at the blood on the pavement.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens after the paramedics arrive?",
    "Client: The police show up. They're asking questions, taking statements. I tell them what I saw, but it feels... mechanical. Like I'm talking about something that happened to someone else. The driver is sitting on the curb, his head in his hands. He looks... broken.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling about the driver?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me is angry. If he'd been more careful, this wouldn't have happened. But he looks so devastated. I can't help but feel sorry for him too. It's all just... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep breathing. What happens as the scene starts to wind down?",
    "Client: People are starting to disperse. The woman's body is covered now. They're loading her into the ambulance, but everyone knows... The street is eerily quiet. I can see the skid marks on the road, the dent in the car. It's like... like the world changed in an instant.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this point?",
    "Client: I keep replaying it in my head. Over and over. Wondering if I could have done something, anything. I feel... I feel guilty for being okay when she's not.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for what happened. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. Like I've run a marathon. But the images, they're still so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 75 now. Still high, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, John. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh... your desk, the window, the bookshelf, the clock, and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Shaken, but okay. It's still hard to talk about, but... maybe a little less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now. Still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... I think it helped? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a challenging process, but you're making progress. Let's end here and discuss some self-care strategies for the rest of your day."
