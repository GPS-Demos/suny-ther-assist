    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a massive earthquake. I was at home, working in my office. Suddenly, everything started shaking violently. The bookshelves were swaying, and books were falling off. I could hear the windows rattling and things crashing in other rooms. I was frozen in my chair, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: I... I felt terrified. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I thought the whole house would collapse on me. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move. The shaking seemed to go on forever. I could hear my wife screaming from downstairs, but I couldn't reach her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I felt so helpless. I couldn't protect my wife or myself. The ground kept moving, and I heard a loud crack. Part of the ceiling fell near me, and dust filled the air. I finally managed to get under my desk, but I was shaking uncontrollably. I thought we were going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, the shaking stopped. But I was too scared to move. I could hear car alarms and people shouting outside. The power was out, and it was getting dark. I called out to my wife, but she didn't answer at first. Those few seconds of silence were agonizing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Finally, I heard her voice. She was okay, just trapped by some fallen furniture. I stumbled down the stairs, tripping over debris. When I reached her, we just held each other and cried. Our home was in ruins, but we were alive. Yet, I couldn't shake this feeling of vulnerability and fear.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My hands are sweating, and my heart is racing again. I can almost feel the ground moving. But it's also... different. I'm here, safe, talking about it. It's intense, but I'm managing.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Keep breathing slowly.",
    "Client: (nodding) The aftermath was chaos. No power, limited water, and aftershocks kept coming. We slept in our car for days, jumping at every little tremor. I felt like a failure for not being able to protect our home, our lives. It brought back memories of feeling neglected as a child, like no one was there to protect me then, and I couldn't protect anyone now.",
    "Therapist: You're connecting those experiences well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Sad, angry, but also... relieved? Talking about it is hard, but it's like releasing a weight I've been carrying. I've never really described it in detail before. It's overwhelming, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult, but I want to keep going. After the earthquake, I struggled with constant anxiety. Every little shake or loud noise would send me into a panic. I couldn't sleep properly for months. My depression got worse, and I felt like I was failing my wife and my business. But somehow, we got through it. We rebuilt, literally and figuratively. It's still hard sometimes, especially when there are small tremors, but I'm learning to cope.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... stronger, I think. Talking about it is bringing up a lot of emotions, but I'm handling them better than I expected. It's like facing the memory head-on is making it less scary. Don't get me wrong, it's still intense, but I feel like I'm regaining some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. Let's continue next session."
