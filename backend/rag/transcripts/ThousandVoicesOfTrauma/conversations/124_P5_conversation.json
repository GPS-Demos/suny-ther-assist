    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving my experiences with the cult... it's overwhelming. I've spent so much time trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will bring back all the pain and confusion I felt when I lost my wife to the cult. It's been years, but sometimes it feels like yesterday. I'm afraid I might fall apart or get stuck in those memories.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Maybe just reassure me that this is going to help? That I'm not going to lose myself in the process? It's hard to believe that revisiting these traumatic memories could be beneficial.",
    "Therapist: This process, while challenging, aims to reduce your PTSD symptoms. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's been a long journey since I left the cult and lost my wife. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly heal. But I'm here, and I'm willing to try. Can you explain a bit more about how this exposure therapy works?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll gradually revisit memories, allowing you to process them safely. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess my main question is, what if I can't handle it? What if I start panicking or get too emotional? I've always prided myself on staying composed, especially at work, but this feels like it might break me.",
    "Therapist: If it becomes overwhelming, we'll pause. You're in control. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I've been using some breathing techniques you taught me, but I'm not sure if they'll be enough when we're dealing with such intense memories. And... I'm worried about how this might affect me outside of our sessions. Will I be able to function normally at work?",
    "Therapist: Great question. Let's create a post-session plan to ensure you feel grounded. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I suppose I'm also worried about how this might affect my current relationships. I've kept a lot of my past hidden from my colleagues and even some friends. Will this process change how I interact with them? And... I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this, but I'm concerned about crying in front of you. It's not something I'm comfortable with.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Crying is a natural response. How can we make you more comfortable?",
    "Client: I appreciate your understanding. Maybe... could we have some tissues nearby? And perhaps we could agree on a signal if I need a break? I'm feeling a bit more at ease knowing I have some control over the process. It's just... it's been so long since I've allowed myself to really think about what happened.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use your signal and take breaks as needed. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm nervous, but I also feel a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? That I'm finally going to face this. It's been like a shadow over my life for so long. I just hope that by the end of this, I'll be able to think about my wife and our time together without feeling overwhelmed by the pain of how it ended. Okay... I'm ready. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll start gently. Close your eyes when you're comfortable. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Alright. *takes a deep breath* I'm closing my eyes now. It's... it's strange. I can already feel my heart beating a little faster. But I'm here. I'm doing this. For myself, and for the memory of my wife. I just hope... I hope this helps me find some peace.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Let's begin..."
