    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Jake?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. I can still feel my heart racing a bit. That memory of the bullying, it just... it brought up so much. And then thinking about the police brutality cases we've been seeing in the news, it's like it all got mixed together in my head.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. Both in my own experience and imagining those situations with the police. It's like... you're just trapped, you know? There's nowhere to go, no one to turn to. I kept thinking about how unfair it all is, how some people can just... have so much power over others.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really overwhelming. How did your body react?",
    "Client: My palms got sweaty, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like I couldn't breathe properly. And my mind was racing, jumping from one scary thought to another. I kept seeing flashes of those bullies' faces, and then they'd morph into police officers. It was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You handled that intensity well. How does it compare to your day-to-day anxiety?",
    "Client: It's... similar, but more concentrated, if that makes sense? Like, my everyday anxiety is this constant low hum, but this was like turning the volume up to max. But weirdly, now that it's over, I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something big and came out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you make of that feeling?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm not as helpless as I thought? Like, yeah, those memories are awful, and what's happening in the world is scary. But I'm here, I'm talking about it, I'm... I'm doing something about it. That feels important somehow.",
    "Therapist: It is. How might this insight affect your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, maybe... maybe I could try to remember this feeling when my anxiety spikes? Like, remind myself that I've faced tough things before and I can do it again. And maybe... I don't know, maybe I could look into some local activism or something? Turn some of this fear into action?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I could... maybe look up some local community groups? Or even just talk to a friend about all this. I've been keeping it all bottled up, but maybe sharing would help. And who knows, maybe they're feeling similar things.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. And even though it stirred up a lot, I also feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit lighter? Like I've put down a little piece of the weight I've been carrying. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common and positive response. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe... maybe things can get better. It's scary, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Jake. We'll build on this next time.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I'm looking forward to it. And maybe dreading it a little too, if I'm honest. But mostly looking forward. This feels important, you know? Like I'm finally dealing with stuff instead of just trying to ignore it or run away from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How will you take care of yourself tonight?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long shower, maybe do some deep breathing exercises. And then... maybe I'll call my sister. I've been avoiding family, but... maybe it's time to reconnect a bit. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a thoughtful plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. It's a lot to process, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little more grounded? Like I have a bit of a roadmap now, even if it's just for the next few hours. That helps.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, you can always reach out if needed. Take care, Jake.",
    "Client: Thanks, I will. And... yeah, thanks again. This was tough, but... I think it was important. I'll see you next week."
