    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those moments during the earthquake... it's scary. Plus, with everything going on online lately, I'm not sure I can handle more stress.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the earthquake was so traumatic. I lost my home, and the constant aftershocks kept me on edge for weeks. And now, with this cyberbullying situation, I feel like I can't escape stress anywhere. The thought of purposely revisiting those memories feels overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm worried it'll make things worse. What if I can't handle it? And with all the online harassment I'm dealing with now, I'm not sure I have the energy for this.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is commendable. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain more about what we'll be doing exactly? And how it's supposed to help with both the trauma from the earthquake and my current anxiety? I feel like I'm juggling so many issues right now.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the memory gradually, at your pace. It helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I guess. But how does this fit in with everything else going on? The cyberbullying has been really getting to me lately. It's like I can't escape stress, whether it's from past trauma or current issues.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. This process can help build resilience for both past and present challenges.",
    "Client: I see. That's interesting. I hadn't thought about it that way before. So, you're saying that by working through the earthquake trauma, I might be better equipped to handle the cyberbullying too? That's... actually kind of encouraging.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Shall we start with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. I'm still nervous, but I'm trying to keep an open mind. It's just hard sometimes, you know? Balancing school, dealing with online harassment, and now facing these old traumas. But if this can really help me become more resilient overall, I'm willing to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness is courageous. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Yes, I think I'm ready. Can you walk me through what we'll do step by step? And maybe... could you remind me of some grounding techniques if things get too intense? I want to feel prepared.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go slowly, use grounding when needed. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I'm glad you're here to guide me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and can help me navigate all these complex feelings and experiences. Okay, let's do this. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful that this could be a turning point for me."
