    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of witnessing the violence... it brought back so many intense feelings. I could almost smell the fear in the air, you know? It's like I was right back there, watching it all unfold again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The shouting, the crash of objects breaking... it was so vivid. I remember feeling so helpless, like I should have done something, but I was frozen. I keep thinking about how I could have intervened, maybe prevented it somehow. But then I remind myself that I was just a child. What could I have really done?",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on that helplessness feel now?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me still feels guilty, but another part recognizes that I was just a kid. I couldn't have stopped it. But that realization doesn't make the memories any less painful. I still feel this knot in my stomach when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it relate to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I still struggle with feeling helpless sometimes. Like when I'm having an anxiety attack, or when I see something on the news about violence. It triggers that same feeling of being powerless. But going through this therapy, I'm starting to see that I'm not that helpless child anymore. I have resources now, ways to cope. It's just... it's hard to remember that in the moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been really grounding. And... this might sound silly, but sometimes I talk to my younger self, tell her it's not her fault and that she's safe now. It helps me separate the past from the present. Oh, and I've been trying to be more open with my partner about my feelings. That's been scary but also really supportive.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. But I can see how it's helping. Each time, it gets a little easier to face those memories. They're still painful, but they don't have the same power over me that they used to. I'm starting to feel like I'm taking control back, bit by bit. It's exhausting, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What's your main takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Going through these memories is hard, but I'm doing it. And each time, I learn something new about myself. Today, I realized that even though I felt helpless then, I'm not helpless now. I have choices, I have support, and I'm actively working on healing. That's... that's pretty powerful, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How will you care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I've planned a quiet evening at home. My partner knows today was a therapy day, so they're prepared to give me space if I need it. I'll probably do some journaling, maybe take a long bath. Oh, and I've been trying this new thing where I list three things I'm proud of myself for at the end of each day. I think today, getting through this session will definitely be on that list.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. Sometimes it's hard to see it day-to-day, but looking back to where I was when we started... yeah, there's definitely a change. I feel more... I don't know, more in control of my own story, I guess. It's empowering, even if it's scary sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. As challenging as it is, I'm committed to this process. I know it's helping, even on the days when it feels really tough. I'm looking forward to seeing where this journey takes me. Thank you again for your support and guidance.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
