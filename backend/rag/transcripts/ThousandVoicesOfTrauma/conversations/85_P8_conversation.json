    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that hospital room, you know? The smells, the sounds, it all came flooding back. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What specific sensations are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: Well, there's this tightness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. And my hands are clammy. I can feel this tension in my shoulders too, like I'm bracing for something. It's... it's uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: I see. And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment. The doctors were rushing around, and I couldn't do anything. I was just lying there, thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" And then I feel guilty because I survived, but so many others don't. It's like... why me? Why did I get to walk out of there?",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: They make me feel... I don't know, a mix of things. Scared, definitely. There's this lingering fear that it could happen again at any moment. But also grateful, I suppose. And then guilty for feeling grateful. It's all tangled up.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my husband. He was there, holding my hand, looking so worried. I remember thinking I might never see him again, never get to say goodbye properly. And now, sometimes when he touches me, I flinch. I don't mean to, but it's like my body remembers the fear and pain from the hospital.",
    "Therapist: How does that affect your relationship?",
    "Client: It's... it's put a strain on things. I love him so much, and I know he's trying to understand, but sometimes I see the hurt in his eyes when I pull away. I want to explain, but I don't know how to put it into words. How do you tell someone that their touch, which used to bring comfort, now sometimes brings back memories of the worst day of your life?",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe if I could somehow remind myself that I'm safe now? That what I'm feeling is a memory, not reality. But it's hard in the moment. It's like my brain short-circuits and I'm back there, vulnerable and afraid.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving. Like I'm letting out a breath I've been holding for a long time. It's still scary to think about, but sharing it makes it feel less... overwhelming, I guess. Like maybe I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this experience has taught you about yourself?",
    "Client: That's a tough one. I suppose... I'm stronger than I thought. I survived something I never thought I could. But also that I'm more vulnerable than I realized. It's humbling, really. And it's made me appreciate the little things more. A quiet moment with my husband, a sunny day... they mean so much more now.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this affecting your future?",
    "Client: I'm trying to take it day by day. Some days are better than others. I hope that eventually, the fear will fade, and I'll be able to fully enjoy life again without this constant shadow. But I also know it's changed me fundamentally. I don't think I'll ever take my health or my relationships for granted again.",
    "Therapist: What support do you feel you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need patience. From myself, from my husband, from everyone around me. And maybe some tools to help me ground myself when the memories get overwhelming. And... and I think I need to keep talking about it. As hard as it is, I can feel that it helps.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaky, but like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying. It's scary to face these memories, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, progress maybe? Like I'm moving forward, even if it's just a tiny step.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on some of those grounding techniques we talked about. And maybe explore how I can communicate better with my husband about what I'm going through. It feels important to bridge that gap.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling okay. A bit drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like after a good cry. I'm glad we did this, even though it was hard. Thank you for listening and guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
