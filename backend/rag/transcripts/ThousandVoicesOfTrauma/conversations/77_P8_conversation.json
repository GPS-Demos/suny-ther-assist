    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I can still feel the officer's hand on my arm, you know? I keep replaying that moment when he slammed me against the wall. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Anger, mostly. And fear. I'm angry that I was treated that way, that someone who's supposed to protect us could be so violent. But I'm also scared. What if it happens again? What if next time it's worse? I feel... powerless.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about those feelings of powerlessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm trapped. In that moment, I couldn't do anything. I couldn't fight back, I couldn't run away. I was just... there, taking it. And now, even though it's over, I still feel that way sometimes. Like I have no control over what happens to me. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and my jaw feels tight. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. It's like my body's getting ready to... I don't know, fight or run, I guess. But there's nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? I've always tried to be a good person, to follow the rules. And then this... It makes me question everything. Like, is the world just inherently unfair? Are we all just one step away from being victims?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you?",
    "Client: They make me feel... hopeless, I guess. And anxious. I find myself always on edge now, always looking over my shoulder. I used to love going for walks in the evening, but now I'm too scared. It's like my whole world has shrunk.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel ashamed. Which is stupid, right? I mean, I didn't do anything wrong. But there's this voice in my head that keeps saying, \"Maybe if you'd done something differently, this wouldn't have happened.\" And I know that's not true, but I can't shake it.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight in my stomach. And my face feels hot, like I'm blushing. It's uncomfortable. I want to curl up and hide. But at the same time, there's this... energy. Like I want to scream or punch something. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of those conflicting feelings?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's like... part of me wants to disappear, to forget it all happened. But another part of me is angry and wants justice. It's exhausting, feeling pulled in different directions all the time.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these intense emotions?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not very well. Sometimes I try to distract myself with work or TV. Other times, I just cry. I've been drinking more than I used to, which I know isn't good. And I've been isolating myself a lot. It's just... it's hard to explain to people who haven't been through it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to be different?",
    "Client: I want to feel safe again. I want to be able to walk down the street without my heart racing. I want to trust people in authority. And... I want to stop blaming myself. I want to be able to look in the mirror and not see a victim, but just... me. The person I used to be.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to express that desire?",
    "Client: It's... kind of liberating, actually. And a little scary. Like, what if I can't get back to that? But saying it out loud... it makes it feel more possible. Like maybe there's hope after all.",
    "Therapist: What gives you that sense of hope?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That I haven't given up. And... knowing that there are people who understand, who want to help. It's a small thing, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on that hope?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by setting small goals? Like, going for a short walk during the day. Or reaching out to a friend I've been avoiding. Just... baby steps towards reclaiming my life.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good start. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Still shaky, but... a little lighter, I think. Like maybe I'm not completely stuck after all. It's a small change, but it's something. Thank you for listening.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue working through this together."
