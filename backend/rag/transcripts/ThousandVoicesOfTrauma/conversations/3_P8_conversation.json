    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating, but not in a violent way. More like a low hum. The memory of being in that cult compound, witnessing the violence... it's still so vivid. I can smell the incense they always burned, and hear the chanting in the background. It's unsettling how real it feels, even now.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how naive I was. How could I have let myself get drawn into something so dangerous? I was supposed to be smart, you know? A professional. But I fell for their lies hook, line, and sinker. And then to see what they were capable of... I feel so much shame. And anger. Anger at them for manipulating me, but also anger at myself for being so gullible.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I... I'm also feeling a strange sense of loss. As twisted as it was, there was a sense of belonging there. A purpose. Now, even though I know it was all based on lies, I sometimes miss that feeling of being part of something bigger. Is that crazy? To miss something that was so harmful?",
    "Therapist: That's not crazy at all. It's a common experience.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. As I was going through the memory during the exercise, I noticed my heart racing. It's still beating pretty fast now. And my palms are sweaty. It's like my body is still stuck in that moment, you know? Like it's expecting something bad to happen at any second.",
    "Therapist: How do these physical sensations affect you?",
    "Client: They make me feel vulnerable, I guess. Like I'm not in control of my own body. It reminds me of how I felt in the cult, always on edge, never knowing what was going to happen next. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a sense of relief? Like, I'm feeling these things, but I'm safe now. I'm here, in this room, with you. Not back there.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, as I let myself feel these things, the intensity is... not exactly decreasing, but changing. It's like waves. Sometimes it feels overwhelming, but then it ebbs a bit. And I'm realizing that I can handle it. It's uncomfortable, sure, but I'm not falling apart. That feels... significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: It is significant. How does this realization impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... stronger, I suppose. Like maybe I'm not as broken as I thought I was. Don't get me wrong, I still have a long way to go. But being able to face this memory, to really sit with it and not completely lose myself, that feels like progress. It's like... for the first time, I can see a future where this doesn't define me. Where I'm not just a victim or a survivor, but just... me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. How does that potential future feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. And scary. Like, really scary. Because if I'm not defined by this trauma, then who am I? What do I want? These are questions I haven't let myself think about in a long time. But there's also a sense of excitement. Like maybe I get to rediscover myself, or even create a new self. It's overwhelming, but in a different way than the trauma. It's like... standing on the edge of something new, something unknown. But this time, I'm choosing to be there. I'm not being manipulated or coerced. It's my choice.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I need to sit with this for a bit. To let it all sink in. But I also need to know that I'm not alone in this process. That even as I'm rediscovering or reinventing myself, I have support. From you, from my partner, from the people in my life who genuinely care about me. I guess I need reassurance that it's okay to feel all of these conflicting emotions. That it's part of the healing process.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely is. You're doing great work here.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I... I'm feeling pretty drained now. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but now I know I can put it down sometimes. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: It is huge. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To really ground myself in the present. And maybe... could we review some of those grounding techniques we talked about before? I have a feeling I might need them in the coming days as I process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
