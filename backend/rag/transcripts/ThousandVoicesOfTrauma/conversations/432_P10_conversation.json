    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, describe the event as vividly as you can, in the present tense. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit on edge. My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. But I want to do this. I need to do this.",
    "Therapist: Good. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my apartment. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm sitting on my couch, scrolling through my phone. The TV is on in the background, but I'm not really paying attention to it. I hear a noise... at first, I think it's just the neighbors. But then...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a loud crash. It's coming from my bedroom window. My heart starts racing immediately. I... I freeze for a second, not sure if what I heard was real. Then I hear footsteps. Oh God, someone's in my apartment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My mouth goes dry, and I can feel my heart pounding in my ears. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I'm just sitting there, paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably around 70. Maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I hear them moving around in my bedroom. There's the sound of drawers opening and closing. I finally manage to stand up, but I'm shaking so badly I can barely walk. I need to get out, but the front door is across the living room. I'd have to pass the hallway to my bedroom to reach it.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to be quiet. I'm tip-toeing towards the door, but my breathing is so loud. I'm sure they can hear me. I'm halfway across the room when I hear the bedroom door open. Oh God, they're coming out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: It's a man. He's tall, wearing dark clothes and a ski mask. He sees me and freezes for a second. Then he starts moving towards me. I can't... I can't breathe. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I try to run, but I trip over the coffee table. I fall hard, and suddenly he's on top of me. His hands are... they're all over me. I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm trying to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel nauseous. My muscles are so tense, it hurts. I... I can feel his weight on me, pinning me down.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. Maybe higher. I don't know if I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here, you're safe. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: He's... he's tearing at my clothes. I'm trying to fight back, but he's so strong. I manage to scratch his face, and he hits me. The pain is sharp, and for a moment, everything goes dark. When I come to, he's... he's inside me. It hurts so much. I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. You're safe here. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I can hear myself whimpering. I've never felt so helpless, so... violated. I close my eyes, trying to pretend I'm somewhere else. But I can still feel everything. His breath on my neck, his hands bruising my skin.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: It feels like it lasts forever, but finally, he finishes. He gets up, and I hear him rummaging through my things again. I'm lying there, unable to move. I'm in so much pain, and I feel... I feel dirty. Ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He comes back. For a terrifying moment, I think he's going to... to do it again. But he just grabs my wallet from the coffee table. Then he's gone. I hear the front door open and close. I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. I can't stop crying. I want to call for help, but I can't move. I just lie there, feeling broken and alone.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 85.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... I... I did survive. But I felt so powerless. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently. Maybe if I had fought harder, or if I had a weapon...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you needed to survive.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but... it's hard. I feel like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts. Let's refocus on what happened next.",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I lay there. Eventually, I managed to crawl to my phone. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely dial 911. When I heard the operator's voice, I broke down completely.",
    "Therapist: What were you feeling then?",
    "Client: Relief, I guess. But also shame. I felt exposed, vulnerable. I didn't want anyone to see me like that.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happened when help arrived?",
    "Client: The police came first. They were asking me questions, but I could barely speak. Then the paramedics arrived. They were gentle, but every touch hurt. I felt like I was watching everything from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you recall this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My chest still feels tight, but... I'm here. I'm safe. It's not happening right now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's continue. What happened at the hospital?",
    "Client: They did a rape kit. It was... humiliating. I felt like I was being violated all over again. But the nurse was kind. She held my hand when I cried.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with that experience?",
    "Client: I... I tried to disconnect. To pretend it wasn't happening to me. But sometimes, the pain would bring me back. I kept thinking about how my life would never be the same.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Sad. Angry. But also... I don't know. There's a small part of me that feels strong for surviving it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important recognition. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. Let's continue with what happened after the hospital.",
    "Client: They released me the next day. My brother came to pick me up. I couldn't bear to go back to my apartment, so I stayed with him for a while. Those first few days were... they were hard. I couldn't sleep. Every noise made me jump.",
    "Therapist: How did you manage during that time?",
    "Client: I... I tried to keep busy. I cleaned my brother's apartment obsessively. I couldn't stand to be idle because then the memories would come flooding back. But at night, when everything was quiet... that's when it was worst.",
    "Therapist: What happened during those nights?",
    "Client: I'd have nightmares. Sometimes I'd wake up screaming, thinking he was there in the room with me. My brother would come running in, and seeing the concern on his face... it made me feel so guilty.",
    "Therapist: Why did you feel guilty?",
    "Client: Because... because I felt like I was burdening everyone. Like I should be able to just get over it. But I couldn't. I still can't.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that healing takes time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, to be honest. But... also a little lighter? Like I've let out some of the poison that's been inside me.",
    "Therapist: That's a good analogy. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you can see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the plant in the corner, your desk lamp, the bookshelf, the clock on the wall, and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How do you feel about what we've done today?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I feel like I've taken a step forward. Like maybe I can face this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I couldn't have done it without your support.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. We'll end here for today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
