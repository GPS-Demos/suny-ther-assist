    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm trying. My heart is already racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take your time.",
    "Client: I see myself at the airport. My son Miguel was leaving for a business trip. I remember hugging him tightly, not wanting to let go. He promised to call when he landed. I watched him walk through security, waving one last time before disappearing into the crowd.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I went home and tried to distract myself by cooking dinner for my grandchildren. But I couldn't shake this uneasy feeling. As I was chopping vegetables, the phone rang. It was Miguel's wife, her voice trembling. She said there had been an accident. The plane... it had crashed shortly after takeoff.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I dropped the knife. My legs gave out, and I collapsed onto the kitchen floor. I couldn't breathe. My chest felt so tight. I kept thinking, \"No, no, it can't be true.\" I wanted to wake up from this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The next few hours were a blur. Family members started arriving. The house was filled with crying and disbelief. I remember sitting on the couch, staring at the wall, unable to process what was happening. My daughter held my hand, but I couldn't feel it. I was numb.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The days that followed were torture. Identifying his body, planning the funeral... it all felt surreal. I kept expecting Miguel to walk through the door, laughing about some big misunderstanding. But he never did. At the funeral, I couldn't even cry. I just felt... empty.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: After everyone left, that's when it really hit me. The silence in the house was deafening. I found myself in Miguel's old room, clutching his childhood teddy bear. That's when I finally broke down. I cried for hours, screaming, asking why. Why him? Why my son?",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. You're safe.",
    "Client: The pain... it was physical. Like someone had ripped out a part of me. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the plane crashing. I imagined Miguel's fear in those final moments. Was he thinking of me? Did he suffer?",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: Months passed, but the pain didn't lessen. I started having nightmares about planes crashing. I couldn't bear to see airplanes in the sky. I avoided the airport at all costs. Even the sound of a plane overhead would send me into a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt so guilty for being alive while my son was gone. I started to withdraw from everyone. My chronic pain got worse. I couldn't focus on anything. It was like a part of me died with Miguel that day. And I... I don't know how to live without that part of me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I still expect him to call. Every time the phone rings, there's a split second where I think it might be him. And then reality crashes back, and the pain is fresh all over again. I miss him so much. I just want my son back.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I'm trying to be strong for my grandchildren, but it's so hard. They remind me so much of Miguel. I see him in their smiles, their laughter. It's both comforting and painful. I want to be there for them, but some days, the grief is just too overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings back all those feelings. But somehow, I also feel a little lighter. Like I've shared some of the burden. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so painful, but maybe... maybe talking about it like this can help. I want to learn how to live with this grief, for Miguel's sake. He wouldn't want me to suffer like this forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today."
