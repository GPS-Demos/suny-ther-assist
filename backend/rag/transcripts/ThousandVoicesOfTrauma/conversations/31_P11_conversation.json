    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that airplane crash... it's like I was right back there. The chaos, the screaming, the smoke... it's all so vivid. I can still feel the heat on my skin and smell the burning fuel.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. There was nothing I could do. We were plummeting, and I just... I couldn't save anyone. Not even myself. It's frustrating, you know? I'm usually so in control, but in that moment, I was completely powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of powerlessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It... it bleeds into everything. I find myself constantly trying to control every aspect of my life. I overplan, I overthink, I... I've been drinking more than I should, just to numb that feeling. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How did it feel to confront that memory today?",
    "Client: Terrifying, but... also somewhat liberating? I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long. Facing it head-on was hard, but... I'm still here. I survived telling the story, just like I survived the actual crash. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What does that realization mean to you?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for? It's easy to focus on feeling weak or helpless, but surviving something like that... and now being able to talk about it... that takes strength, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly does. How might this impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I can start trusting myself more? Trusting that I can handle difficult situations without... without turning to alcohol or trying to control everything. It's scary, but... maybe it's possible?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe... maybe I could try to let go of control in small ways? Like... not planning every minute of my day, or... or allowing myself to feel emotions without immediately trying to numb them. It's terrifying, but... I think I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's brave. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe practice some of those moments here? Like, could you give me scenarios where I have to let go of control, and we work through my reactions? I think having a safe space to practice might help.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll incorporate that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... hopeful? It's like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now... now I can see a possibility of putting it down. It's not gone, but... but maybe it doesn't have to control me forever. That's... that's a new feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how this trauma has affected my relationships. I've been so isolated, pushing people away... I want to understand why, and maybe... maybe start to change that.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I'm not the easiest client, with my substance use and all... but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. It's scary, but... but I'm grateful.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll try something new. Instead of my usual routine of working late and drinking, maybe I'll take a walk in the park near my house. Just... just be present in nature for a bit. It sounds small, but... it feels like a big step.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. I'm proud of your progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm starting to feel a bit proud too. It's unfamiliar, but... but nice. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, and remember to be gentle with yourself."
