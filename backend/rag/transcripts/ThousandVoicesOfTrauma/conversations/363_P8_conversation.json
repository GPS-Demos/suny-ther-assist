    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. The memory of being in that hospital room, it just... it feels so vivid right now. I can almost smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was strapped to that bed, and it was like... like I was imprisoned in my own body. The doctors and nurses, they were trying to help, but it felt so invasive. I couldn't move, couldn't speak... it was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly overwhelming. How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is reliving that moment of panic all over again. I... I want to run, but I know I'm safe here. It's just... it's hard to convince my body of that.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that I had to go through that, angry at the circumstances that put me there. And there's this deep sadness too, like mourning for the person I was before all of this happened. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: They're... they're intense, but not as overwhelming as they were then. Back then, it felt like I was drowning in these emotions. Now, it's more like... like I'm observing them from a distance. They're still there, still powerful, but I feel a bit more in control, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What's helping you feel more in control now?",
    "Client: I think... knowing that I'm here, in a safe place. And remembering the coping strategies we've talked about. Deep breaths, grounding myself... it helps. And honestly, just being able to talk about it, to put it into words... that feels empowering in a way I didn't expect.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's relief, definitely. Like I'm letting go of a weight I've been carrying. But there's also vulnerability. Talking about it makes it real in a different way. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe healing? It's like I'm reclaiming my story, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: The tightness in my chest is starting to ease a little. I'm still shaky, but it's not as intense. I'm... I'm actually starting to feel a bit tired. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. How else has this experience affected you?",
    "Client: It's made me realize how much this trauma has influenced my life. The way I avoid hospitals, how I panic during medical procedures... it all stems from this. But talking about it, facing it head-on like this... it's hard, but I think it's necessary. I want to reclaim my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What does reclaiming your life look like to you?",
    "Client: I think... being able to go to a doctor's appointment without having a panic attack. Maybe even volunteering at a hospital someday, to help others who are going through similar experiences. Just... not letting the fear control me anymore. Being able to live my life without this constant shadow hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's been a journey. Some days are harder than others. But overall, I feel like I'm moving forward. Sessions like this, as difficult as they are, make me feel stronger. Like I'm facing my demons head-on. It's exhausting, but also... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you're proud of from today's session?",
    "Client: I'm proud that I was able to stay present through the whole exposure exercise. There were moments when I wanted to check out, to disconnect, but I stayed with it. That feels like a big step for me.",
    "Therapist: It is. How would you like to care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time. Maybe a warm bath and some calming music. And I'll probably call my daughter later. Talking to her always helps ground me. Is it okay if we end a bit early today? I'm feeling pretty drained.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done incredible work today. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This isn't easy, but... I'm grateful for your support. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. I'll see you then."
