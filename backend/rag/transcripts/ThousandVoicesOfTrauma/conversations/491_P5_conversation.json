    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to forget about what happened in the military. The idea of purposely bringing those memories back feels terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like reliving everything all over again?",
    "Therapist: Not exactly. It's more controlled. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: That's a relief. But still, why do we need to do this? Isn't it better to just move on?",
    "Therapist: Avoidance can actually maintain PTSD symptoms. This helps process memories.",
    "Client: I see. But how will talking about it help? I've tried that before and it didn't change anything.",
    "Therapist: This is different. It's structured and repeated, allowing your brain to reprocess the trauma.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I understand. But what if I panic during the session?",
    "Therapist: We'll have coping strategies ready. You're in control and can stop anytime.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I'm still scared, but I want to get better. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies, but we'll go at your pace. Your bravery is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you walk me through what we'll do exactly?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with relaxation exercises, then you'll describe the event in present tense.",
    "Client: Present tense? Why is that important?",
    "Therapist: It helps engage emotions and process the memory more effectively.",
    "Client: I see. And what happens after I describe it?",
    "Therapist: We'll discuss your thoughts and feelings, helping you process the experience.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous but willing to try. Is there anything I should do to prepare?",
    "Therapist: Just be kind to yourself. This is challenging work, but you're not alone.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm glad you're here to guide me through this. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is inspiring. Shall we begin with a relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but I'm ready to face this. Let's start."
