    "Therapist: Hello, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the plane crash lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face it head-on.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your anxiety is normal. Shall we discuss the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose we should. It's just... the thought of reliving that moment makes my heart race. I can already feel my palms getting sweaty. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: It is. It helps process the trauma. Would you like to know more about how it works?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I mean, I trust you, but I'm struggling to see how deliberately thinking about the worst day of my life is going to help me get better.",
    "Therapist: It allows you to confront memories safely, reducing their power over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense in theory, but... what if I panic? What if I can't handle it? I've been trying so hard to keep it together for my family. I don't want to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: You won't be alone. I'll guide you through it. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I appreciate your support, Dr. Thompson. It means a lot, especially since... well, since the divorce, I've felt like I'm carrying this burden all by myself. So, what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in detail, present tense. I'll record it for homework.",
    "Client: Present tense? Like it's happening now? That sounds intense. And you mentioned homework \u2013 what does that involve?",
    "Therapist: You'll listen to the recording daily, processing emotions and memories.",
    "Client: Daily? Wow, that's... a lot. I'm worried about how this might affect my work. I've been struggling to concentrate as it is. Will this make it worse before it gets better?",
    "Therapist: Initially, it may be challenging. But over time, symptoms often improve.",
    "Client: I see. I guess I'm willing to try if it means I might finally get some relief. How long does this process usually take?",
    "Therapist: It varies. We'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes. I'm scared, but I'm also tired of living like this. The constant anxiety, the flashbacks... I want my life back. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, we're in this together.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. That means a lot. I'm glad you're here with me for this. Okay, deep breath... I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start. Close your eyes and take me to that day..."
