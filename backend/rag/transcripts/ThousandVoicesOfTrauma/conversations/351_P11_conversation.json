    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Rodriguez?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doc. It's like I'm back there, you know? The smell of gunpowder, the heat... it's all so vivid. I can still hear the choppers overhead and the screams of my buddies. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The moment I lost my best friend, Carlos. We were pinned down, and he... he took a hit meant for me. I can't shake the image of his eyes as he... as he died in my arms. It's haunting me all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... God, it was awful. I felt so helpless, so angry. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I'm finally facing it instead of running from it. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many find relief in confronting these memories. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much guilt I've been carrying. I've always felt responsible for Carlos's death, but going through it again... I see now that there was nothing I could've done differently. We were just kids in an impossible situation.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I guess. But also sad. I've been blaming myself for so long, and now I'm not sure what to do with all these feelings.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel conflicted. How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start forgiving myself. Maybe I can finally talk to Carlos's family without feeling like a fraud. And the nightmares... they might not have the same power over me anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like significant steps. What do you think?",
    "Client: Yeah, they are. It's scary, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. I've been stuck in that moment for so long, you know? But now... now I can see a future where I'm not defined by that day.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to focus on the good memories of Carlos. Maybe that'll help balance out the trauma. And I want to work on accepting that I survived for a reason. It's time I started living again, for both of us.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I never thought I'd be able to face this, but here I am. It's tough, but I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'm nervous, but I'm also kind of looking forward to it. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, that works. Thanks again, doc. I'll see you then.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Rodriguez. Remember to use your coping strategies if needed."
