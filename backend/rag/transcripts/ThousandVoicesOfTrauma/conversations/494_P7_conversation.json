    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a severe earthquake. I was at home when it hit. The ground started shaking violently, and I could hear things crashing all around me. I remember feeling frozen, unable to move as the walls seemed to sway.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking felt like it lasted forever. I could hear car alarms going off outside and people screaming. I tried to get to a doorway, but I stumbled and fell. The power went out, and suddenly everything was dark. I was terrified, thinking the building might collapse at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My heart was racing so fast, I thought it might burst out of my chest. I couldn't catch my breath. The aftershocks kept coming, and each time I thought, \"This is it. This is the one that's going to bring everything down.\" I felt so helpless, so small against the power of nature.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As the shaking subsided, I managed to crawl to a corner, huddling there in the dark. I could smell gas and was scared there might be a fire or explosion. I wanted to run outside, but I was afraid of what I might see. The uncertainty was overwhelming. I kept thinking about my family, my friends, wondering if they were okay, if they were even alive.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is harder than I thought. My chest feels tight just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Okay... After what seemed like hours, I finally gathered the courage to leave my apartment. The scene outside was chaos. Buildings were damaged, cars overturned, and there were injured people everywhere. I felt guilty for being relatively unharmed. The aftershocks continued for days, and each one brought back that initial terror. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next quake to hit.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: The weeks following were a blur of relief efforts, cleanup, and trying to contact loved ones. The city was in shambles, and so was I. I couldn't go back into tall buildings without panicking. Every little vibration or sound made me jump. I felt like I was living in a constant state of fight-or-flight. It's been years, but sometimes I still wake up in a cold sweat, thinking the ground is moving.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's bringing up a lot of emotions. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter, if that makes sense. It's like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and sharing it is helping, even though it's painful.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never realized how much this experience still affected me until now. I've tried so hard to push it down and move on, but I guess it's always been there, just below the surface. Talking about it is scary, but I think it might be necessary for me to truly heal.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is valuable. Let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous about diving deeper, but I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe by facing this head-on, I can finally start to move past it. It's exhausting to always be on guard, always waiting for the next disaster. I want to feel safe again, to not have this constant undercurrent of fear in my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see why it's important. I've avoided thinking about the earthquake for so long, but maybe confronting it is the key to not letting it control me anymore. I'm scared, but I'm also ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll end here for today."
