    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40? It's not terrible, but I can definitely feel the anxiety creeping in.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting in my room. It's late, maybe around midnight. The glow from my laptop screen is the only light. I can hear my roommates laughing in the living room, but I feel so... isolated. I'm scrolling through social media, and suddenly I see it. A post about me. It's... it's cruel. They've taken an old photo of me from high school and edited it to make me look ridiculous. The comments are even worse. \"Go back to where you came from,\" \"Terrorist,\" \"Sand monkey.\" I feel my heart racing, my palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking. I want to look away from the screen, but I can't. It's like I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" And then I start to wonder if maybe they're right. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I should just disappear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I close the laptop. I can't bear to look anymore. But I can still hear my roommates laughing outside, and it makes me feel even more alone. I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. I'm trying not to cry, but I can feel the tears coming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm lying there, and I can't stop thinking about all the other times I've felt like this. The sidelong glances in the grocery store, the \"random\" security checks at the airport. It all comes flooding back. I feel so... small. So powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I reach for my phone. I want to call someone, anyone. But who would understand? Who would even care? I scroll through my contacts, but I can't bring myself to reach out. I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. They're valid. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I notice how quiet my room is. It's suffocating. I can hear my own heartbeat, it's so loud. And I'm... I'm angry. At the people who posted that, at myself for letting it affect me so much. I want to scream, but I don't want my roommates to hear.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these intense emotions?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not coping well. I start pacing around my room. I'm biting my nails, a habit I thought I'd broken years ago. I keep checking my phone, hoping for... I don't know what. A message from someone who cares? But there's nothing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing great. What happens as the night goes on?",
    "Client: I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see those comments. I keep imagining people I know seeing that post, laughing at me behind my back. I toss and turn for hours. When I finally drift off, I have nightmares about being chased, about falling into a bottomless pit.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel when you wake up the next morning?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted. Drained. Like I've been hit by a truck. My eyes are puffy from crying, and I have this hollow feeling in my chest. I don't want to face the day.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I call in sick to work. I can't bear the thought of facing people. I stay in bed, scrolling through my phone, checking to see if the post is still there. It is. There are even more comments now. Each one feels like a knife twisting in my gut.",
    "Therapist: How are you managing these feelings?",
    "Client: I'm not. I'm just... existing. I can't eat. I can't focus on anything. I keep replaying every social interaction I've had recently, wondering if I said or did something to provoke this. It's like my whole life has been reduced to this one moment, this one post.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens as the day progresses?",
    "Client: I finally force myself to get up and take a shower. The hot water helps a little, but as soon as I'm out, the anxiety comes flooding back. I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and I hardly recognize the person staring back at me. I look... defeated.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does it make you want to do?",
    "Client: I... I want to disappear. I start thinking about deleting all my social media accounts, changing my phone number, maybe even moving to a new city where no one knows me. But then I feel angry at myself for letting them win.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that conflict?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how to handle it. I feel paralyzed. I end up just sitting on my couch, staring at the wall. Hours pass, and I barely move. My phone keeps buzzing with notifications, but I'm too scared to look at them.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind during this time?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my parents, how hard they worked to give me a better life here. And now I feel like I'm letting them down. Like I'm not strong enough to handle this. I feel like a disappointment.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How does your body feel as you're thinking them?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense they're almost up to my ears. My stomach is in knots. I feel... heavy, like there's a weight pressing down on my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally work up the courage to check my phone. There's a message from a coworker asking if I'm okay. It's not much, but it... it helps. It reminds me that not everyone is cruel, that there are people who care.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a tiny spark of hope. I still feel awful, but it's like... like I can see a pinprick of light in the darkness. I decide to respond to the message, just a simple \"Thanks for checking in.\"",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How do you feel after sending that message?",
    "Client: A little better. A little less alone. But also... scared. Scared that I'm opening myself up to more hurt.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. What do you do with that fear?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself that not everyone is like the people who posted that cruel message. I think about the friends who have stood by me in the past. It doesn't make the pain go away, but it... it helps me feel a little stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down more. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How does the day end?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to eat something, even though I don't have much appetite. I put on some music, something soothing. I still feel shaky, but I'm not as overwhelmed as I was earlier. I decide to turn off my phone for the night, to give myself a break from it all.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like good self-care. How do you feel as you're getting ready for bed?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud of myself for making it through the day. I know tomorrow will be hard too, but I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can face it.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. Let's end the exposure here. Take a deep breath and slowly open your eyes when you're ready. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It was hard to go through all that again, but I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40 now. Same as when we started, but it feels different somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few moments to process what you experienced today..."
