    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of that hurricane... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the wind howling, you know? It's like it's right here in the room with us.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaky. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It reminds me of how I felt when the water started rising in my apartment. That panic... it's still there, just beneath the surface.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are coming up for you?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if it happens again? What if next time I'm not so lucky? It's stupid, I know. I live in a different state now, far from the coast. But the fear... it doesn't care about logic, does it?",
    "Therapist: Fear often doesn't. How else has this experience affected you?",
    "Client: It's made me... hyper-vigilant, I guess? I obsessively check weather reports now. Any hint of a storm and I'm... well, I'm a mess. And it's not just about the weather. It's like I'm always waiting for the next disaster. In my relationships, at work... I'm always bracing for impact.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I... hmm. You know, it's not just the hurricane. It's like it brought up all these old feelings from when I was bullied in school. That same sense of helplessness, of being at the mercy of something I couldn't control. Back then, it was the bullies. During the hurricane, it was nature itself.",
    "Therapist: I see. What emotions are you experiencing right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix. There's fear, definitely. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Angry at the bullies, angry at the hurricane, angry at myself for still being affected by all of this. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness. Like I've lost something I can't quite name.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you coping with these emotions?",
    "Client: Not well, if I'm being honest. I've been isolating myself more. Drinking more than I should. It's like I'm trying to numb myself, you know? But it doesn't really work. The feelings are still there, just... muffled.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away from all of this. But another part knows that's not the answer. I guess... I need to feel safe again. To believe that I can handle whatever comes my way. But I don't know how to get there.",
    "Therapist: That's a good insight. How might we work towards that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by facing these memories head-on? It's terrifying, but avoiding them clearly isn't working. And talking about it here, as hard as it is... it feels like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how I've survived so much already. The bullying, the hurricane... I'm still here. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. It's just... it's hard to hold onto that belief when the fear hits, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. How might you remind yourself of that strength?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I need to start keeping a journal or something? Write down the times I've overcome challenges. Create some kind of... I don't know, a toolkit for when I'm feeling overwhelmed? It sounds cheesy when I say it out loud, but...",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What else might help?",
    "Client: I think... I need to reconnect with people. I've pushed everyone away, and that's probably not helping. Maybe talking to others who've been through similar experiences could help me feel less alone in this. And... I should probably look into some healthier coping mechanisms. The drinking... it's becoming a problem.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's scary to look at all of this head-on, but... I think it might be necessary. I can't keep living in fear of the next disaster, whether it's real or just in my head.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to dig deeper into this connection between the bullying and the hurricane. They've always felt separate in my mind, but now I'm seeing how they're linked. And maybe understanding that link will help me... I don't know, reframe how I see myself and my experiences?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good direction. Shall we explore that next time?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. It's not going to be easy, but... I'm ready to try. Thank you for... for creating a space where I can talk about all of this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... hopeful? Yeah, hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's a way through this. It's going to be hard work, but... I think I'm ready for it.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll continue next session. Take care."
