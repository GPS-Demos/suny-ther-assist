    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My heart's already racing just thinking about it. But I know we need to do this, right?",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is good. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do it before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking down 5th Avenue. It's a sunny afternoon, but there's tension in the air. People are gathering for a protest against police brutality. I can see signs, hear chanting in the distance. The crowd is diverse \u2013 all ages, races. I'm feeling... anxious, but also determined. This matters, you know?",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: More people are joining. The energy is building. I can smell street food from nearby vendors mixing with the scent of asphalt baking in the sun. Suddenly, there's a commotion up ahead. People start running. I... I hear shouting, then a loud crack. Oh God, was that a gunshot?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm frozen for a second, then I start moving towards the sound. People are screaming now. I push through the crowd and I see... I see a young man on the ground. There's blood. So much blood. An officer is standing over him, gun still drawn. The look on his face... it's not fear or regret. It's... it's almost satisfaction. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. This can't be real. I want to help, but I'm terrified. What if they shoot me too? I'm angry, so angry. But mostly, I feel helpless. Completely helpless.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's an 8, maybe even a 9. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember your grounding techniques. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: Right, right. I'm... I'm trying. The crowd is in chaos now. People are screaming, crying. Someone's yelling for a medic. I see a woman kneeling beside the young man, pressing her jacket against his wound. Her hands are covered in blood. I want to look away, but I can't. I feel like I need to bear witness, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: More police arrive. They're in riot gear now, forming a line. Someone throws a bottle. It shatters near the officers. Suddenly, there's tear gas. My eyes are burning. I can't breathe. People are coughing, stumbling. I'm being pushed and shoved as everyone tries to get away. I lose my balance and fall. For a moment, I think I might be trampled.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... I manage to get up. My knee is scraped, but I barely feel it. The adrenaline is pumping. I see a young woman helping an elderly man who's struggling with the tear gas. I run over to help. We support him between us as we move away from the chaos. I can still hear shouting, sirens in the background. The air is thick with gas and tension.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel... shaky. Like I could snap at any moment. But also... there's this weird sense of connection with the strangers around me. We're all in this together, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What happens next?",
    "Client: We make it to a side street. People are handing out water, helping flush eyes. I help the elderly man sit down on a stoop. He's thanking us, but I can barely hear him over the ringing in my ears. I look back towards the main street. The police line has advanced. They're pushing people back, swinging batons. I see someone get hit, go down hard. I want to go help, but... I'm scared. I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel conflicted in such a situation. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I stay where I am. I help people as they come down the side street, offering water, checking for injuries. But I can't shake this feeling of guilt. Like I should be doing more. I keep thinking about that young man who was shot. Did he survive? Was there something I could have done?",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. I feel so tense, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: Right, right. (deep breath) As the crowd thins out, I start walking home. My clothes smell like tear gas. My eyes are still stinging. I pass by broken windows, overturned trash cans. It looks like a war zone. I keep replaying everything in my mind. The gunshot. The blood. The look on that officer's face. I feel... I feel changed. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How does it affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I'm angry at the injustice. Scared for my community. But also... determined. Like I can't just go back to my normal life and pretend this didn't happen. I need to do something, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: These are all valid feelings. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. Drained. But there's this... this restless energy too. Like I'm on high alert. I get home and I just... I break down. I sob for what feels like hours. My partner holds me, but I can't even explain what I'm feeling. It's just... too much.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling now, thinking back on all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still intense. My heart's racing. But... I feel like I can breathe a little easier. Like... like talking about it helps somehow. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. That's a normal part of processing trauma. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down some. Maybe a 6? I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay... yeah, that helps. I... I didn't realize how much I was holding onto, you know? It's like... like I've been carrying this weight around.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do you feel about having shared this today?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Part of me feels relieved, like I've let something out. But another part feels... exposed? Vulnerable? Like I've opened up this wound again.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, okay. I... I think I need a minute. This was... intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You've done excellent work today, John.",
    "Client: Thanks... I... I hope this helps. I want to move past this, you know? But also... I don't want to forget. It feels important to remember.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. We'll explore that more in our future sessions.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah. I... I appreciate this. It's hard, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's end our session here. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks, doc. This... this means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
