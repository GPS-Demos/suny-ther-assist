    "Therapist: Hello, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Anderson. I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. My son dropped me off, and he seemed worried. I told him not to be, but... well, you know how children are, even when they're grown.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. I've been wondering about it since you mentioned it last time. What exactly does it involve?",
    "Therapist: It's a way to process your trauma memories. We'll revisit the event in your mind, and you'll describe it out loud.",
    "Client: Oh my... that sounds quite intense. I'm not sure I can do that. The memories... they're still so vivid, even after all these years. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back there, watching it all happen again. It's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Many find it challenging at first. How are you feeling about trying?",
    "Client: I'm scared, to be honest. But I trust you, Dr. Anderson. You've helped me so much already. If you think this will help, I'm willing to give it a try. It's just... will it make things worse? I've worked so hard to keep these memories at bay.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel apprehensive. This process can actually reduce the power those memories hold over you.",
    "Client: Really? That would be... well, it would be life-changing. I've lived with this fear for so long. The nightmares, the anxiety... it affects everything. My late husband used to say I was jumping at shadows. I miss him dearly, especially now. He always knew how to calm me down.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry for your loss. Your courage is admirable. Shall we discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to be prepared. Will it be like reliving the whole thing again?",
    "Therapist: It may feel intense, but you're safe here. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's a relief to hear. I was worried I'd have to go through it all at once. It's comforting to know I have some control. Will you be guiding me through it, or do I just... start talking?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you with questions. You'll describe the event, including thoughts and feelings.",
    "Client: I see. That sounds manageable. I'm still nervous, but knowing you'll be there to guide me helps. What if I become overwhelmed? Sometimes when I think about it, I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: If that happens, we'll use grounding techniques. Remember the breathing exercises we practiced?",
    "Client: Yes, I do. I've been using them at home when I feel anxious. They help quite a bit. It's good to know we have those tools if things get too intense. Is there anything else I should know or prepare for?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional during and after. Be gentle with yourself. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I understand now. It won't be easy, but I'm ready to try. Thank you for explaining it all so patiently. You know, my anxiety has been better since we started our sessions, but this childhood trauma... it's been a shadow over my entire life. I'm hopeful that this might finally help me move past it.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to engage is a big step. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Anderson. That means a lot to me. I feel more prepared now, and dare I say, even a little optimistic. Shall we begin?"
