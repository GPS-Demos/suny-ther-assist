    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",

    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's jumped to a 7. My palms are sweating, and I feel tense all over.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: The impact is deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. I'm jerked violently to the side. There's a sharp pain in my chest. I can't breathe. I'm panicking, thinking I might die...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is tight, and I'm trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear people shouting. Someone's asking if I'm okay. I smell gasoline and burnt rubber. I'm disoriented, trying to focus... Oh God, I remember seeing the other driver. He's not moving...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. Even though I know it wasn't my fault, I can't help but think... if I had been more alert, maybe...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel this way. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: (Nods) The paramedics arrive. They're checking me over, asking questions. I can barely focus. I keep looking at the other car, praying the driver is okay...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... dropping a bit. Maybe an 8? I'm starting to feel less panicked, but still shaken.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. Continue.",

    "Therapist: I understand. This is a difficult memory. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Hours later, a doctor finally tells me the other driver survived. The relief is... indescribable. But then the guilt hits again. His injuries were severe. I know his life will never be the same...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel drained, but less panicked.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel physically?",

    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but... I think it's getting easier to face this memory.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Let's end here. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say a 5. I feel... raw, but also a bit lighter.",
