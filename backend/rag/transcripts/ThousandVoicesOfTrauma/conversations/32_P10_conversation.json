    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 6 or 7 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm 15 again. It's a Saturday morning, and I'm at the community center. The... the cult leader, he calls himself \"Father Michael,\" he's there. He's smiling at me, but it doesn't reach his eyes. God, I can smell his cologne from here. It's sickly sweet.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he puts his hand on my shoulder. Says he needs to talk to me privately. I follow him to his office. My heart's racing. I know something's wrong, but I can't... I can't disobey him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) Okay... We're in his office now. He locks the door. I can hear the click. It's so loud. He turns to me and says... he says I've been chosen for a special blessing. But his eyes... they're hungry.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see his desk. It's dark wood, polished. There's a photo of him with some important-looking people. I hear muffled voices outside, kids laughing. But in here, it's so quiet. I feel... God, I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he tells me to sit on the couch. It's leather, cold. He sits next to me, too close. His hand is on my knee. I want to run, but I can't move. He's talking about purity and sacrifice, but his words are blurring together.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are sweating. My chest feels tight. I... I think I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: He... he starts to unbutton my shirt. His hands are cold. I'm frozen. I can't speak, can't move. He's saying it's God's will, that I'm special. But I feel... I feel dirty. Ashamed. Like I'm betraying everything I believe in.",
    "Therapist: Remember, this wasn't your fault. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here, John.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) He... he touches me. Places I've never been touched before. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I'm crying, silently. He tells me this is our secret, that no one will understand. That if I tell anyone, I'll be cast out, damned.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm there again. But also... angry. So angry.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. Let's pause for a moment. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... I'm... I'm back in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Do you want to continue or take a break?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep going. To get it all out.",
    "Therapist: Alright. When you're ready, return to the memory.",
    "Client: After... after he's done, he prays over me. Like nothing happened. Like he didn't just... (voice breaks) He tells me I'm blessed now, that I should be grateful. I feel sick. I can barely stand. When I leave his office, everyone's still going about their day. No one knows. No one can see how broken I am inside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I go home. I can't look my parents in the eye. I shower for hours, but I still feel dirty. I can't sleep that night. Or the next. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face. Feel his hands. I start having nightmares. Panic attacks. But I can't tell anyone. I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My jaw hurts from clenching it. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Try to relax your muscles. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Exhales slowly) It's hard. It's like my body still remembers.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep breathing. What happened in the days after?",
    "Client: I... I started withdrawing. From my family, my friends. I couldn't stand to be touched. I flinched at every sound. My grades started slipping. I couldn't focus. And every Saturday, I had to go back. Face him again. Pretend everything was normal.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: This went on for... for months. Every week, the same thing. Sometimes worse. He'd... he'd make me do things to him. Say it was part of my \"training.\" I felt so powerless. So trapped. I started thinking about... about ending it all.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're here now. You survived.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I did. But sometimes I wonder at what cost.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. What happened to end the abuse?",
    "Client: It... it was my mom. She noticed the changes in me. Kept asking what was wrong. One day, I just... broke down. Told her everything. She was... she was devastated. Angry. But not at me. She went to the police that same day.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Relieved. Like a huge weight was lifted, but also like my world was ending. The cult... they turned against us. Called us liars, sinners. We had to move away.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a huge upheaval. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about what happened now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still angry. At him, at the cult, at myself sometimes. But I'm also... proud, I guess? That I survived. That I'm here, talking about it. It doesn't control me as much anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's start winding down. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... I'm... I'm back in the room with you. Fully.",
    "Therapist: Well done, John. That was incredibly brave of you.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it wasn't easy, but I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Let's end with a final SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 3 now? It's much better.",
    "Therapist: Excellent progress. We'll pick up here next session. For now, take care of yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for everything."
