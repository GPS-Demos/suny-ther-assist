    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving those cult experiences... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... I've worked so hard to build a new life. I have a good job now, a loving partner. I'm afraid if I go back there in my mind, I'll lose all this progress. What if I can't handle it? What if I relapse?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared it'll just make everything worse. I've been having more nightmares lately, just thinking about this session.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Imaginal exposure can be challenging, but it's a powerful tool for healing.",
    "Client: How does it work exactly? Will I have to describe everything in detail?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic memory while I guide you. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Will I lose control? I'm worried about getting too emotional or... I don't know, maybe even dissociating. It happened a lot when I was in the cult, and sometimes still does when I'm really stressed.",
    "Therapist: Your safety is my priority. We have grounding techniques to use if needed. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance that this won't undo all my progress. That I won't go back to being that scared, manipulated person I was in the cult. Can you promise me that?",
    "Therapist: While I can't promise specific outcomes, many find this process empowering. Your strength brought you here.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you. I'm still scared, but I want to try. Can we start slowly? Maybe not dive into the worst parts right away?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start gently and build gradually. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... please don't let me get lost in there, okay? Promise you'll pull me back if it gets too intense?",
    "Therapist: I promise. You're in control, and we can stop anytime. Shall we start with a grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would help. And... thank you. For being patient with me. I know I'm not the easiest client.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Your courage is admirable. Let's begin..."
