    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise focusing on your cult experiences?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the compound. It's early morning, and I can smell the damp earth. The leader is calling us for the daily ritual. I feel... conflicted. Part of me wants to go, but another part is screaming to run away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking as I put on the white robe. I can hear others shuffling around me, getting ready. The air feels thick, oppressive. I'm... I'm scared, but I can't show it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 60? My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're walking to the circle. The leader's voice is getting louder. I can see his face now, those piercing eyes. He's talking about sacrifice, about proving our devotion. I feel sick. My legs are weak, but I can't falter. They'll notice if I show any doubt.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Trapped. Terrified. Like I can't breathe. It's like I'm there again, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 80? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The leader is... he's singling people out. Asking them to prove their faith. I'm praying he doesn't choose me. I can't... I can't do what he's asking. But if I refuse, I'll be punished, or worse, cast out. I feel so alone, even surrounded by all these people.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. I'm here with you. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe 75. My palms are sweating, but... I feel a little more grounded knowing you're here.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The ritual is reaching its peak. There's chanting, it's getting louder. The leader is... he's coming towards me. Oh god, he's looking right at me. I can feel everyone's eyes on me. I want to disappear, to sink into the ground.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he asks me to step forward. My legs are moving, but it doesn't feel like I'm in control. I'm standing in front of everyone now. He's asking me to renounce my family, to prove my loyalty to the group. I... I can hear the words coming out of my mouth, but it doesn't feel like me speaking. I feel... I feel like I'm betraying myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe 65? I feel... I feel sad more than anything now.",
    "Therapist: It's normal for emotions to fluctuate. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My breathing is calmer, but I feel drained. Like I've run a marathon.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're doing well. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I can. After the ritual, I remember going back to my room. I felt... empty. Like I'd lost a part of myself. I sat on my bed for hours, just staring at the wall. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. I was afraid someone would hear me.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually less intense now. Maybe a SUDS of 50? I feel a deep sadness, but also... anger? I'm angry at them for putting me through that.",
    "Therapist: That anger is a natural response. Let's pause here. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... I feel like I've faced something important. Thank you for being here with me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take some deep breaths together before we end."
