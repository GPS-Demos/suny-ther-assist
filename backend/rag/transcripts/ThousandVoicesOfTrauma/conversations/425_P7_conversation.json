    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the airplane crash scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm on the plane. It's shaking violently. The oxygen masks have dropped. People are screaming. I can smell something burning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The plane is tilting. I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. I can hear the engines making a terrible noise. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) The plane is losing altitude fast. Luggage is falling from the overhead compartments. A child nearby is crying hysterically. I'm frozen in my seat, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a sudden jolt, and I'm thrown forward against my seatbelt. The lights flicker and go out. It's dark, and the plane is filled with terrified screams. I can feel tears running down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: We're plummeting towards the ground. I can see trees through the window, getting closer and closer. I'm saying a prayer, thinking about my family. The flight attendant is yelling instructions, but I can barely hear her over the noise.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. My whole body is tense, and I feel like I'm going to be sick. We're so close to the ground now. I close my eyes and brace for impact.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a deafening crash. My body is jolted violently. I can hear metal tearing, glass shattering. The plane is breaking apart around me. I'm still strapped in my seat, but I'm upside down. Everything hurts.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I open my eyes. There's smoke everywhere. I can hear people moaning in pain. I'm struggling to breathe. My seatbelt is jammed, and I can't get out. I'm panicking, thinking I'm going to die here.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory courageously. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. It's too vivid, too real.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) Okay... I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt and fall to what used to be the ceiling of the plane. I'm crawling through debris, trying to find a way out. I can smell fuel and smoke. It's getting harder to breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see a crack in the fuselage and start pushing my way through. My hands are cut and bleeding, but I keep going. Finally, I break through and tumble out onto grass. The fresh air hits me, and I start coughing uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Shocked. Relieved. I can't believe I made it out. I'm lying on the grass, looking up at the sky, hearing chaos around me. People are screaming for help. I want to help, but I can't move. I just lie there, crying and trembling.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember thinking about my children, how I needed to survive for them. It gave me strength. Slowly, I managed to sit up and look around. The scene was horrific. Parts of the plane scattered everywhere, small fires burning. I felt guilty for surviving when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory with courage. Continue.",
    "Client: I saw rescue workers arriving. They were running towards the wreckage. One of them came to me, asked if I was okay. I couldn't speak, just nodded. He helped me to a safe area where other survivors were gathering. I was in shock, couldn't believe what had happened.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. Reliving it is hard, but... I feel a bit lighter. Like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You've shown great strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still painful, but I think I understand now why we're doing this. It's helping me face it instead of avoiding it.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're making progress. How do you feel about ending here for today?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. It's been intense, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we finish."
