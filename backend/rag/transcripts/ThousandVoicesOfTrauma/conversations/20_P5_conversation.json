    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that night, seeing all that violence again. I've spent so long trying to forget it. What if it makes everything worse? What if I can't handle it? I'm already struggling with my depression, and this feels like it might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. That might help. It's just... I've never done anything like this before. I'm used to keeping busy, you know? Throwing myself into my studies to avoid thinking about it. But now you're asking me to do the opposite. It's... it's scary.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Shall we go over the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Please do. I need to understand why we're doing this. Why can't we just... I don't know, talk about it without having to relive it?",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: But how? How does putting myself through that again help? I've been having nightmares and flashbacks for years. Isn't this just... voluntarily subjecting myself to more of that?",
    "Therapist: It's different. We'll face the memory in a safe, controlled environment.",
    "Client: Safe and controlled... okay. I guess that makes sense. But what if I panic? What if I can't get through it?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We can pause or stop anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to know. I appreciate that. I just... I'm worried about what might come up. There's so much I've tried to forget. What if I remember something even worse?",
    "Therapist: That's a possibility. We'll handle whatever arises together.",
    "Client: Together. Right. Okay. I'm still nervous, but... I trust you, Dr. Thompson. You've helped me a lot these past few months. If you think this will help, I'm willing to try. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail. It may be emotional, but that's normal and okay.",
    "Client: In detail? Like, everything I saw and heard? That's... that's a lot. I've never really talked about it all before. I'm not sure I even remember everything clearly. It's all jumbled up in my head.",
    "Therapist: That's common. We'll work through it slowly. Your feelings and reactions are important.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I can do this. It's going to be hard, but if it helps me get better, helps with the depression and the nightmares... it's worth trying, right? I just... I want to feel normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, John. This is a significant step towards healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm still scared, but... I'm also hopeful. Maybe this will help me finally move forward, stop feeling stuck in that moment. I'm ready to try, Dr. Thompson. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's begin. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy, but I'm willing to try."
