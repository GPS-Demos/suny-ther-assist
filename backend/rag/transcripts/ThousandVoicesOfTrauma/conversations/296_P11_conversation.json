    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that earthquake was so vivid. I could almost feel the ground shaking beneath me again. It's strange because I've been so focused on the cyber bullying lately, but this brought back all those intense feelings from the disaster.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The rumbling of the earth, people screaming, glass shattering. It's like it was happening all over again. And the helplessness... I felt so small and powerless against nature's fury. It's similar to how I feel when I'm being attacked online, you know? That same sense of vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... tough. Really tough. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. But... I also noticed something different this time. I was able to remind myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: Well, I realized that the fear I felt during the earthquake is similar to the anxiety I experience when I open my social media. It's like I'm always waiting for the next \"tremor,\" you know? The next nasty comment or threat. But just like with the earthquake, I survived. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. How might this realization help you?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it can help me face my online fears more courageously? If I could survive something as terrifying as an earthquake, surely I can handle some mean comments, right? It's not easy, but... I feel a bit stronger now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to work on not letting the cyber bullies have so much power over me. Maybe I can use some of the grounding techniques we've practiced when I feel overwhelmed online, just like I did during this exposure. It's scary, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How can we support that goal?",
    "Client: Um, perhaps we could practice more? Like, maybe role-play some online scenarios? And... I think I need to talk more about the earthquake too. It's clearly still affecting me more than I realized.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yeah... I just want to say thank you. This is hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. It's like the pieces are slowly coming together, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous but... determined. I want my life back. Both from the trauma of the earthquake and from these online bullies. I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in a while, I feel like it might actually be possible. I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. What would you like to focus on next session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to delve deeper into the connection between my earthquake trauma and my online anxiety. Maybe we could explore some specific incidents of cyber bullying and see how they tie into my broader PTSD symptoms? And definitely more practice with coping strategies. I want to feel more in control when I'm online.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Kind of empowered, actually. It's like I've uncovered a missing piece of the puzzle. I'm anxious about what's to come, but also excited to keep working on this. It feels like I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you again. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful about the future. Is it okay if we end a bit early today? I think I need some time to process everything we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
