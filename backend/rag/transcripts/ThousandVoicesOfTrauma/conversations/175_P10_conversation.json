    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, describe the event as if it's happening now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. My hands are already getting clammy. But I know this is important, so I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Good. Start when you're ready. Use present tense.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm boarding the plane. It's a sunny day, and I can feel the heat on my skin as I walk across the tarmac. The smell of jet fuel is strong, making my stomach churn a little. I find my seat - it's by the window. As I sit down, I notice how cramped it feels. The seat belt... it's snug across my lap.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The plane starts to taxi. I can hear the engines revving up, getting louder. It's... it's making me tense. My heart is beating faster. We're picking up speed now, racing down the runway. The force pushes me back into my seat. We're lifting off, and I can see the ground getting farther away through the window.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling anxious. My palms are sweaty, and I'm gripping the armrests tightly. The plane is climbing higher and higher. I can hear a baby crying somewhere behind me, and it's making me even more on edge.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We've reached cruising altitude. The seatbelt sign turns off, and people start moving around. I'm trying to relax, but I can't shake this feeling of dread. Every little bump or sound makes me flinch. I'm... I'm starting to feel trapped. The air feels thick, and it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: Right, okay. I'm... I'm trying to distract myself by watching the in-flight movie, but I can't focus. My mind keeps wandering to worst-case scenarios. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and the plane shudders violently. People are screaming. The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands shaking so much I can barely get it on.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The plane is dropping fast. I can see the ocean getting closer through the window. People are praying, crying. I'm frozen in my seat, gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. The flight attendants are shouting instructions, but I can barely hear them over the roar of the wind and the alarms blaring.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: Water. We're getting closer to the water. It's all I can see now. The plane is shaking so violently, I think it's going to break apart. I'm... I'm saying goodbye in my head to my family, my girlfriend. I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: We hit the water with a massive impact. The sound is deafening. Water is rushing in through cracks in the fuselage. People are screaming, trying to get out of their seats. I'm struggling with my seatbelt, my fingers numb with fear. The water is rising fast, it's up to my knees now. I finally get the belt off and stand up, but the aisle is chaos. Everyone's pushing and shoving.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. I can't think straight. The water's getting higher, and I'm desperately trying to remember where the nearest exit is. I'm pushing past people, trying to get to a door. The water's up to my chest now. I can hear people drowning around me. I... I can't save them. I have to save myself.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: Right, okay. I'm... I'm at a door now. Someone's managed to get it open. The rush of water is intense. I'm swept out of the plane into the ocean. The water is freezing, and I'm gasping for air. I can see debris everywhere, and people flailing in the water. I'm trying to swim, but my clothes are so heavy. I'm kicking off my shoes, trying to stay afloat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm treading water, looking around frantically. There's an inflatable slide from the plane nearby. I swim towards it, my arms and legs burning with the effort. I manage to grab onto it and pull myself up. I'm shivering uncontrollably, coughing up water. I can see other survivors in the water, calling for help. I'm trying to help them onto the raft, but it's so difficult. The waves are big, and I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Scared. Guilty that I can't save everyone. Cold. So cold. And... and relieved that I'm alive, but then immediately ashamed of feeling relieved when others didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: We're drifting on the raft. I can see the plane sinking in the distance. The screams are getting fewer. It's... it's awful. I feel so helpless. We're all huddled together on the raft, trying to keep warm. I can see injuries - people bleeding, broken bones. I'm trying to help, but I don't know what to do. I keep looking at the horizon, praying to see a ship or a plane.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a mix of hope and despair. My body aches all over. I'm so cold and tired. The sun is setting, and I'm terrified of what the night will bring. Will we be found? Will we survive the night? I'm trying to comfort the person next to me, but I'm barely holding it together myself.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: Night falls, and it's pitch black. The only sound is the lapping of waves and occasional sobs. I'm trying to stay awake, afraid I'll fall off the raft if I sleep. My thoughts keep drifting to my family, wondering if they know what's happened. I'm... I'm feeling so alone, even surrounded by other survivors.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: As dawn breaks, I see something on the horizon. At first, I think I'm hallucinating, but then others see it too. It's a ship! We start waving and shouting. As it gets closer, I can see it's a coast guard vessel. They're lowering boats to come get us. I'm... I'm crying with relief. We're being rescued.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed with emotion. Relief, gratitude, but also... guilt. Why did I survive when others didn't? As they're pulling us onto the rescue boat, I can see bodies in the water. It's... it's devastating.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I feel drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced it and got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Take some deep breaths. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: *Takes deep breaths* Thank you. That was... intense. But I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also a bit relieved. Like a weight has been lifted. My heart isn't racing anymore, and I feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 2, I think.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session."
