    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sound of the wind, the crashing... it's all so vivid. I can feel the panic rising in my chest again.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I keep clenching my jaw without realizing it. And my stomach feels like it's in knots.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. The earthquake came out of nowhere, and I... I couldn't do anything to stop it. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" And now, even though I know I'm safe, there's this nagging fear that it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear affect you in your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. I'm constantly on edge, always looking for the nearest exit wherever I go. I've stopped going to crowded places because I'm afraid of getting trapped if something happens. Sometimes, I even avoid tall buildings. It's like I'm not living, just... surviving.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you feeling as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: Mostly fear, but there's also this deep sadness. I feel angry too, you know? Angry at the world for being so unpredictable. And... and I feel guilty. I made it out okay, but so many others didn't. Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense as they were right after it happened, but they're still pretty strong. Back then, I was in shock. I couldn't process anything. Now, it's like I'm feeling everything I couldn't feel then. It's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you used to cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I've tried deep breathing, but sometimes it just reminds me of struggling to breathe during the earthquake. I've been journaling, which helps a bit. And... well, I've been avoiding a lot of things. I know that's not healthy, but it feels safer.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your perspective on life?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me realize how fragile everything is. One moment, life is normal, and the next, everything's chaos. I appreciate the small things more now, I guess. But I also struggle to plan for the future. It's hard to feel secure about anything.",
    "Therapist: What's the most challenging part of processing this memory?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. And the feeling that I'll never be truly safe again. It's like... like the ground could literally disappear from under my feet at any moment. How do you move forward when you can't trust the world around you?",
    "Therapist: What would moving forward look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe being able to go about my day without constantly worrying about another disaster? Being able to enjoy life again without this cloud of fear hanging over me. Feeling like I deserve to be happy and safe.",
    "Therapist: How do you think confronting these memories might help you reach that goal?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it'll help me process what happened instead of just avoiding it. Maybe if I face it head-on, it'll lose some of its power over me. But it's scary. It feels like opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: What strength have you discovered in yourself through this experience?",
    "Client: I... I never thought I could survive something like that. But I did. I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. It's hard to see sometimes, but... I'm still standing.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on that strength in our future sessions?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on challenging some of my fears? Like, small steps towards facing the things I've been avoiding. And finding ways to feel more grounded and secure. I want to feel like I'm living again, not just surviving.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great direction. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. There's still a lot to work through, but... I feel like maybe there's hope. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's important. I'm... I'm glad I'm doing this, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. We'll continue this work in our next session."
