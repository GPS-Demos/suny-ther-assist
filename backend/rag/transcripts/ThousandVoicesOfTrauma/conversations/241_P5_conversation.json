    "Therapist: Good morning, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Garcia. I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I didn't sleep well last night, thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... the idea of revisiting those memories, you know? I've spent so long trying to forget, to push it all away. The thought of bringing it all back up makes my stomach churn. What if I can't handle it? What if I fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like reliving everything all over again? Because I'm not sure I'm strong enough for that. I've worked so hard to build a life for myself after... after everything that happened.",
    "Therapist: It's not reliving, but recounting. We'll go at your pace. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, please go on. I want to understand how this is supposed to help me. Because right now, it just feels like we're opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process memories safely, reducing their power over you.",
    "Client: Reduce their power? That sounds... that sounds good. But how does it work? I mean, these memories have controlled my life for so long. They've affected my relationships, my work, even how I see myself. Can talking about them really change that?",
    "Therapist: Yes. By facing memories in a safe environment, they become less overwhelming.",
    "Client: Less overwhelming... that's hard to imagine. These memories feel like a tidal wave sometimes, Dr. Garcia. They crash over me when I least expect it. But I trust you. If you think this will help, I'm willing to try. What exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount a specific memory, focusing on details and emotions. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: Okay... that sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I can do that. It might make me feel too vulnerable. And what if I start panicking? What if I can't breathe or I feel like I'm back there again?",
    "Therapist: Eyes open is fine. We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I appreciate your flexibility, Dr. Garcia. It means a lot that you're considering my comfort. I'm still scared, but knowing I have some control helps. How long will this process take? Will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this gradually, over several sessions. Today we'll start slowly.",
    "Client: Gradually sounds good. I think I can handle that. It's just... it's been so long since I've allowed myself to think about what happened. I've been so focused on moving forward, on being strong for my children and grandchildren. The idea of looking back... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is admirable. This process will build on that resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Garcia. Your words mean a lot to me. I've always tried to be strong, to be a role model for my family. But sometimes I feel like I'm just pretending, you know? Like I'm wearing a mask of strength while inside I'm still that scared, helpless woman. Will this help me feel genuinely strong?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can. Facing fears often reveals inner strength we didn't know we had.",
    "Client: That's... that's a powerful thought. The idea of finding strength in confronting my fears. It's almost poetic, isn't it? I've always told my grandchildren to face their fears, but I've been running from mine for so long. Maybe it's time I take my own advice. Okay, Dr. Garcia, I think I'm ready. What's our first step?",
    "Therapist: We'll start by identifying a specific memory to focus on. Are you comfortable with that?",
    "Client: I... I think so. There are so many memories, though. Some are clearer than others. Some are just flashes, sensations. How do we choose which one to start with? And what if I start talking about one memory but then it leads to others?",
    "Therapist: We'll choose one that's significant but manageable. It's okay if memories connect.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust your guidance, Dr. Garcia. I have to admit, part of me is curious to see what happens when I finally allow myself to talk about these things. It's like I've been carrying around this heavy secret for so long, and maybe... maybe sharing it will lighten the load a little?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Sharing can be very healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Let's do this. I'm scared, but I'm also... hopeful? Is that strange? To feel hope when we're about to dive into such dark memories?",
    "Therapist: Not strange at all. Hope is a powerful ally in this process.",
    "Client: Thank you for understanding, Dr. Garcia. Your calm presence is really helping me feel grounded. Okay, I'm taking a deep breath. Where should I start? Do you want me to just begin talking about a memory, or do you have specific questions for me?",
    "Therapist: Start wherever feels right. I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay. I think... I think I'll start with the day I first realized I wasn't free anymore. It was a Tuesday, I remember because..."
