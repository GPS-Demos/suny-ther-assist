    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I want you to describe the event in present tense, as if it's happening now. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How distressed are you from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at home. It's late evening, and I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. The sound of their voices is getting louder, and I'm trying to focus on my textbook, but I can't concentrate. My heart is racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shouting is getting worse. I hear something crash \u2013 I think it's a plate. My mom screams. I'm frozen in my chair, unsure if I should intervene. God, I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel like I can't breathe properly. I want to do something, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally get up. My legs feel weak as I walk towards the kitchen. The arguing gets louder with each step. I push open the door and... oh god.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: My dad has my mom pinned against the counter. There's broken glass on the floor. Mom's crying, and Dad's face is red with anger. I've never seen him like this before.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest. I want to help, but I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I shout at my dad to stop. He turns to look at me, and for a second, I think he might come after me instead. But then something changes in his eyes. He lets go of Mom and stumbles back.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's pretty high... maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: Mom's sobbing now. I go to her, but I don't know what to say or do. I'm angry at Dad, but I'm also scared of him. The kitchen feels so small and suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What are you noticing about your surroundings?",
    "Client: The smell of dinner still lingers in the air \u2013 some kind of curry. It feels so out of place now. The clock on the wall ticks loudly. Every sound seems amplified.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: Dad's not saying anything. He just... leaves. I hear the front door slam. Mom slides down to the floor, and I sit next to her. I want to comfort her, but I feel so useless. Why couldn't I have done more?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for their actions. What happens next?",
    "Client: We just sit there for a while. I can feel Mom trembling next to me. I start picking up the broken glass, careful not to cut myself. It feels like the only thing I can do to help.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb, I guess. And guilty. I should have done more, right?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong in how you reacted. You did what you could in a difficult situation. Continue with what happened.",
    "Client: Mom finally speaks. She says she's okay, but I know she's not. I help her to the living room and make her some tea. My hands are still shaking as I pour the water.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm wondering if this has happened before when I wasn't home. I'm angry at myself for not noticing sooner. And I'm... I'm scared about what will happen when Dad comes back.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We sit in silence for a while. I keep glancing at the front door, dreading the sound of it opening. Mom looks so small and fragile. I've never seen her like this before.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still pretty high... maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, we hear Dad's car pull up. Mom tenses beside me. I stand up, positioning myself between her and the door. I'm terrified, but I'm also determined to protect her.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are tight, ready to react. My mouth is dry. I can hear my heartbeat in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens when your dad enters?",
    "Client: He comes in looking... deflated. The anger is gone, replaced by shame. He tries to approach Mom, but I step in his way. I'm surprised by my own boldness.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Empowering, but also scary. I've never stood up to him before. My voice shakes as I tell him to leave Mom alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad looks shocked. He starts to apologize, but I cut him off. I tell him he needs to leave for the night. To my surprise, he listens. He grabs some things and goes.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also... sad? It's like our family has shattered in a single evening. I sit back down with Mom, and we just hold each other.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 60 now?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens for the rest of the night?",
    "Client: We don't sleep much. We talk a little, but mostly just sit together. I keep replaying the events in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: It's common to second-guess yourself, but remember, you're not responsible for their actions.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard not to feel that way. As the sun starts to rise, I realize everything has changed. Our family will never be the same.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared for the future. But also... determined? I know I need to be strong for Mom.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up this exercise?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've let out something I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *takes deep breaths* Thank you. This was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's come down quite a bit. Maybe around 40 again?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Remember, it's normal for these feelings to linger. We'll work through them together. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm good for now. Just... tired.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've done important work today. We'll pick this up in our next session. For now, focus on self-care and remember the coping strategies we've discussed.",
    "Client: Okay, I will. Thanks for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
