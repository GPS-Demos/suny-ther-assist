    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It was late at night, around 11 PM. I was in the living room, reading a book. My husband had already gone to bed. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from the kitchen. At first, I thought maybe our cat had knocked something over, but then I heard footsteps. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I froze in my chair, unable to move. The footsteps were getting closer. I could hear whispering, more than one person. I wanted to scream, to call for my husband, but no sound came out. Then I saw them - two men, dressed in dark clothes, wearing masks. One of them had a crowbar. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) They saw me. One of them rushed towards me, grabbing my arm. I finally found my voice and screamed. The other one yelled, \"Shut her up!\" I was terrified, thinking they might kill me. I could smell alcohol on their breath. My husband came running down the stairs...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: When they saw my husband, they panicked. One of them shoved me to the ground. I hit my head on the coffee table. Everything was spinning. I heard a scuffle, my husband yelling, and then the sound of breaking glass. When I managed to look up, the intruders were gone, and my husband was on the phone with the police.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... shaking. My heart is pounding. I can almost smell their breath again. It's like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about what could have happened. What if my husband hadn't come down? What if they had weapons? I feel so vulnerable, even now. Every noise at night makes me jump. I can't relax in my own home anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I feel angry too. Angry that they invaded our space, our safety. I hate that they've taken away my peace of mind. Sometimes I have nightmares about it, where I can't move or scream. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part is the lasting effect. I've installed so many locks, security cameras, alarms. I check them obsessively. I can't sleep unless I've checked every window and door multiple times. It's exhausting. My husband tries to understand, but I can see it's wearing on him too. I feel guilty for putting him through this.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be this scared, this paranoid? I used to love having friends over, but now the thought of opening my door to anyone terrifies me. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, and I don't know how to get it back.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress by talking about it. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, maybe a little lighter? It's hard to explain. Talking about it is difficult, but there's a small sense of relief too. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I want to get better. I want to feel safe in my home again. I want to be able to enjoy an evening without constantly looking over my shoulder. I know it's a long process, but I'm willing to work at it.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is commendable. Shall we conclude for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll continue next session."
