    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure how I'll handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in this dingy room. It's dark, and the air feels thick. There's a musty smell, like old cigarettes and sweat. I can hear muffled voices from somewhere else in the building. God, my heart's already racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The door opens. This man walks in \u2013 he's tall, with a shaved head. He's got this look in his eyes that makes my skin crawl. He's talking to someone behind him, laughing about something. I... I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 7. It's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: He walks towards me. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He reaches out and grabs my arm, and I flinch. His grip is so tight, I think it might bruise. He's saying something about... about how I'll make them a lot of money. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) There's another person in the doorway now. A woman. She's looking at me like... like I'm not even human. Just a thing to be sold. I want to scream, to fight back, but I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight. It's hard to breathe. My hands are shaking, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. You're safe here, remember that.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The man is pulling me towards the door. I stumble, and he laughs. The woman is saying something about getting me 'ready'. I don't know what that means, but it terrifies me. I... I can't believe this is happening. How did I end up here?",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about my family. My friends. Will I ever see them again? I feel so stupid for trusting the wrong person, for ending up in this situation. I should have known better...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8, I think. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're leading me down a hallway now. It's dim, lit by flickering fluorescent lights. There are other doors, and I can hear... oh god, I can hear crying behind one of them. My legs feel weak, like they might give out at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: We stop at a door. The woman unlocks it and pushes me inside. It's a small room with just a bed and a chair. The windows are boarded up. They're talking about me like I'm not even there, discussing prices and... and services. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... okay. The man leaves, but the woman stays. She's telling me the 'rules'. No fighting, no screaming, do whatever the clients want. If I don't comply, there will be consequences. Her voice is so cold, so matter-of-fact. I can't believe this is real.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. Angry. Disgusted. But mostly, I feel... broken. Like everything that makes me who I am is being stripped away.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9. This is... it's almost unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: (Voice cracking) The woman leaves, and I'm alone. I curl up on the bed, trying to make myself as small as possible. I can hear footsteps outside, voices. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I keep thinking this has to be a nightmare, that I'll wake up soon. But I don't. This is real, and I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I'm there. Time seems to stop. At some point, I hear the lock turning. My whole body tenses up. I know what's coming, and I'm powerless to stop it. The door opens, and a man I've never seen before walks in. He's smiling, but it's not a kind smile. It's predatory. I want to scream, to fight, to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's take a break. Open your eyes, look around the room. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) I... I'm sorry. It was just so intense.",
    "Therapist: You have nothing to apologize for. You did incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaken. My heart's still racing. But... also a little proud, I guess? I've never been able to talk about it in this much detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a huge accomplishment. You should be proud. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves, then we can discuss what you experienced.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. (Takes a deep breath) Thank you for being here with me through that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You're incredibly brave. Now, let's focus on your breathing for a moment..."
