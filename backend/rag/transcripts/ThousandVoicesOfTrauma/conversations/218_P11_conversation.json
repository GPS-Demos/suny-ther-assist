    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, you know? Going back to those moments in the cult, it's like I'm there again. The smells, the sounds, the fear... it's all so vivid. I can still hear the leader's voice, telling us that we needed to cut ties with our families to be \"pure.\" God, it makes me sick now, thinking about how I believed him.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that memory?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I feel so ashamed that I let myself be manipulated like that. I pushed away my parents, my sister... I missed my abuela's funeral because the cult leader said it would \"taint\" me. I can't believe I was so blind. And now... now my parents have taken me back in, but I feel like such a burden. Like I don't deserve their kindness after what I did.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt connect to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: I... hmm. I guess it's why I have such a hard time trusting myself now. I'm always second-guessing my decisions, worried I'll make another huge mistake. And the anxiety... it's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen or for someone to try to control me again. I have nightmares about being back in the cult, unable to escape.",
    "Therapist: What insights did you gain from today's session?",
    "Client: Well, I realized that even though I made mistakes, I was also a victim. The leader preyed on my insecurities, my desire to belong. It doesn't excuse what I did, but... maybe I can start to forgive myself a little? And I noticed that talking about it, as hard as it is, makes the memory less powerful. Like, it's still awful, but it doesn't have the same chokehold on me.",
    "Therapist: How might this realization impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it'll help me be kinder to myself? And possibly open up more to my family. They've been so supportive, but I've been keeping them at arm's length because of my shame. Perhaps if I can talk to them about some of this, it might help rebuild those relationships. And maybe I can start trusting my instincts again, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: What was the most challenging part of today's exposure?",
    "Client: Definitely reliving the moment I told my parents I was cutting them off. The look on my mom's face... it haunts me. I can still hear her voice cracking as she begged me to reconsider. And my dad, he just stood there, silent and pale. I think that silence hurt more than if he'd yelled at me. It's like I could feel their hearts breaking, and knowing I caused that pain... it's almost unbearable.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, man. Really tough. But... I think it's helping? Like, it's painful as hell, but I feel like I'm finally facing these demons instead of running from them. And each time, it gets a tiny bit easier. Don't get me wrong, it's still excruciating, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: What coping strategies worked well for you today?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises helped a lot, especially when I felt like I was getting too overwhelmed. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that I'm not actually back in that situation. Oh, and focusing on physical sensations \u2013 feeling the chair under me, the texture of my jeans \u2013 that really helped ground me when the memories felt too intense.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on this progress?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try journaling between sessions? Getting some of these thoughts out on paper might help me process them better. And I want to work on those grounding techniques more. They really seem to help. Also, I've been thinking about maybe joining a support group for ex-cult members. Hearing others' experiences might help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. Let's wrap up. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Yeah, I just... I want to say thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. It's painful and scary, but also... I don't know, liberating in a way? Like I'm reclaiming parts of myself I thought I'd lost forever. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also... kind of excited? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Sounds good. Thanks again, doc. See you then."
