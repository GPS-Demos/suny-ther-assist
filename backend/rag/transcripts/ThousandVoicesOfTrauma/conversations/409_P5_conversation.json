    "Therapist: Hello Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Martinez. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and what you mentioned about this imaginal exposure thing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about what happened when I fled Venezuela. The idea of purposely revisiting those memories is terrifying. I'm worried I might fall apart or have a panic attack right here in your office.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I help ease your worries?",
    "Client: I don't know... Maybe explain why we need to do this? And what exactly is going to happen? I mean, I trust you, but this feels like a big step.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. We'll go slowly, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... that makes sense. But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely break down?",
    "Therapist: We'll take breaks if needed. You're in control. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just, ever since losing my sister during our escape, I've been so scared to confront these memories. But I know I can't keep avoiding them forever.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing what's coming might help me feel a bit more prepared.",
    "Therapist: We'll start gradually. You'll describe the event, and I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay... And you'll be here the whole time, right? I'm not sure I could face this alone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here supporting you throughout. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for explaining everything and being so patient with me. It means a lot, especially since I don't have much support here in the States.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm nervous, but I also feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe confronting these memories will help me finally move forward and honor my sister's memory in a healthier way.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. Remember, we'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm taking a deep breath. Here goes..."
