    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be diving into some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40? My stomach's a bit knotted up.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Just give me a second to... to get centered. *deep breath* Alright, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the school cafeteria. It's loud, everyone's talking and laughing. I can smell the greasy pizza and hear the clatter of trays. I'm sitting alone at a table near the corner. I always sit here, hoping to blend in, you know?",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see a group of guys from my class walking towards me. My heart starts racing. I know they're coming for me. They've been picking on me for weeks, making comments about my accent, my clothes... God, I feel so small.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe 60? My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... *inhales* They're getting closer. I can see the smirk on the leader's face. He's tall, blonde. Always wears this stupid varsity jacket. He reaches my table and... and he knocks my tray off. Food goes everywhere. Everyone's staring now. I can feel my face burning with embarrassment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can barely breathe. I want to disappear, to sink into the floor. They're laughing, calling me names. \"Go back to where you came from,\" they're saying. But I was born here! I... I don't understand why they're doing this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take another deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: I... I try to stand up, to leave, but one of them pushes me back down. I stumble, nearly fall. They're circling me now, like vultures. I feel so trapped, so helpless. I can hear other students laughing. No one's helping me. Why isn't anyone helping me?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you want to do?",
    "Client: I want to fight back, to scream at them to leave me alone. But I'm... I'm paralyzed with fear. My throat feels tight, like I can't speak. I'm just sitting there, taking it, hating myself for being so weak.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85 now. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader, he... he grabs my backpack. He's dumping everything out. My books, my notes, they're all over the floor. People are stepping on them, kicking them around. I can see a paper I worked on all night getting torn. I feel... I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why me? What did I do to deserve this? I'm just trying to get an education, to fit in. But they're making it impossible. I feel like I don't belong anywhere. Like I'm some kind of... of alien in my own country.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. The bell rings. Everyone starts leaving for class. The guys, they... they give me one last shove before they go. I'm left there, surrounded by my scattered belongings, feeling... feeling broken. Humiliated. I can't stop the tears now. They're running down my face and I hate it. I hate that they made me cry.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I slowly start picking up my things. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold onto anything. A girl from my English class stops to help me. She doesn't say anything, just quietly helps gather my papers. I'm grateful, but also... also ashamed that she's seeing me like this.",
    "Therapist: How does her help make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. I'm thankful, but also embarrassed. Like, I should be able to handle this on my own. But at the same time, it's the first bit of kindness I've felt all day. It makes me feel a little less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70? My breathing is steadier.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happens after you gather your things.",
    "Client: I... I mumble a thank you to the girl and rush to the bathroom. I lock myself in a stall and just... just break down. I'm sobbing, trying to be quiet so no one hears. I feel so angry, so hurt. I want to call my parents, to go home, but I know they'd be disappointed if I left school. So I just... I just sit there, trying to pull myself together.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, James. Stay with those feelings. What are you telling yourself in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm telling myself to be strong. That I can't let them win. But there's also this voice saying... saying maybe they're right. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I should just give up. It's... it's a constant battle in my head.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65. I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot. What happens after you leave the bathroom?",
    "Client: I splash some water on my face, try to look normal. I head to class, but I'm late. Everyone stares as I walk in. The teacher looks annoyed. I can hear some snickers. I just... I just keep my head down and go to my seat. I feel like everyone knows what happened, like it's written all over me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. How does the rest of the day go?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. I can't focus in any of my classes. I keep replaying the incident in my head, thinking of all the things I should have said or done. I feel so angry at myself for not standing up to them. By the end of the day, I'm exhausted. I just want to go home and hide.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55. I'm feeling... I'm feeling drained, but also a bit relieved to have talked through it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's start bringing you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm... I'm back in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Well done, James. That was a challenging exercise. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um, sure. I see... the clock on the wall, your desk, the plant in the corner, the bookshelf, and the window.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, what's one thing you've learned from revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I've realized how much I've been carrying this with me. How it's affected me. But also... maybe that I was stronger than I thought. I made it through that day, even though it was awful.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, James. We'll explore that more in our next session. For now, how would you rate your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 30 now. I feel pretty calm, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, James. I'm proud of the courage you showed today. We'll pick up here next week.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I... I'm looking forward to it. Thanks again.",
    "Therapist: Take care, James. I'll see you next week."
