    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm back there again, in that moment, and all these emotions are just... flooding over me.",
    "Therapist: Mhm. What emotions are you noticing?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of fear. And shame. God, so much shame. It's like I can feel it in my stomach, this heavy, sickening feeling. I keep thinking about how I should have done something differently, how I should have been stronger or smarter. And then there's this anger too, bubbling up. I'm angry at him, but I'm also angry at myself for not stopping it somehow.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like this burning sensation in my chest and my fists. I want to hit something, you know? But at the same time, I feel so helpless. It's like I'm trapped between wanting to fight and wanting to just... disappear.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his voice, the things he said to me. It's like they're echoing in my head. \"This is your fault,\" \"You asked for this,\" \"No one will believe you.\" And part of me still believes it, even though I know logically that it's not true. I'm thinking about how this has affected every relationship I've had since then, how it's shaped who I am. It's like... it's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always on edge, always expecting the worst.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, to be honest. Talking about it makes it real again. But there's also this weird sense of relief? Like, maybe if I say it out loud, it loses some of its power over me. I don't know. It's confusing. I feel vulnerable, but also... maybe a little stronger? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been holding onto this. It's like... it's like I've been carrying this heavy backpack for years, and I'm just now starting to unpack it. I can feel tension in my shoulders that I didn't even know was there starting to release a little. But it's also overwhelming. I'm worried about what else might come up, what other memories or feelings I've been suppressing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you coping with those worries?",
    "Client: I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe now, that this is just a memory. I'm focusing on my breathing, like we practiced. In through the nose, out through the mouth. It helps a little. And I keep looking around the room, reminding myself where I am. It's... it's hard, but I think it's helping. I feel more... present, I guess? Less trapped in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else are you aware of?",
    "Client: I'm noticing how much easier it is to talk about this now compared to when we first started. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult, but... I don't feel like I'm going to shatter into a million pieces anymore. There's this small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? Like, I'm facing this head-on instead of running from it. It's terrifying, but also... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good, actually. Surprising, but good. Like maybe there's hope, you know? Like maybe I'm not broken beyond repair. I'm still scared, still hurting, but... I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward. It's like... like I'm reclaiming something that was taken from me. My sense of self, maybe? My power? I'm not sure, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. What do you want to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to work on challenging some of those thoughts I mentioned earlier. The ones that still make me feel like it was my fault. I know logically that it wasn't, but emotionally... I still struggle with that. And I want to explore how this has affected my relationships, especially with my wife. I love her so much, but I know this has created barriers between us. I want to learn how to be more open, more vulnerable with her. It's scary, but I think it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, honestly. Emotionally and physically exhausted. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I'm also... cautiously optimistic? Is that the right phrase? It's like I can see a glimmer of light at the end of this very long, very dark tunnel. And for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I might be strong enough to reach it.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I appreciate your support through all of this. It means more than I can express. I know we still have a long way to go, but... I'm grateful for your guidance. I think I'll try to do something relaxing when I get home. Maybe take a warm bath or go for a walk. Just... something to help me process everything we've talked about today.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Take care."
