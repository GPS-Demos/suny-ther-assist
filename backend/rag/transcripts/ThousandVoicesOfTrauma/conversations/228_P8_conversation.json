    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories... they felt so real, like I was back there again. I could smell the musty air of that basement where... where it happened. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that this still affects me so much. I thought I'd moved past it, you know? But reliving it, I felt so helpless again. Like that scared little girl who couldn't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because so many others have suffered too. Especially thinking about my experiences as a refugee... it's like, who am I to complain? But then I get angry at myself for invalidating my own pain. It's this constant cycle of thoughts that I can't seem to break.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: They... they're always there, lurking in the background. Even when I'm at work, trying to focus on a project, sometimes a memory will flash through my mind and I'll lose my concentration. Or when I'm with my partner, and he touches me unexpectedly... I flinch. I hate that. I hate that my past still has this power over me.",
    "Therapist: What did you notice about your ability to stay with the memory during the exercise?",
    "Client: It was... harder than I expected. There were moments when I wanted to pull away, to distract myself. But I tried to stay present, like we've practiced. I noticed that the intensity of the emotions would come in waves. At first, it was almost unbearable, but then it would subside a bit, only to rise again. It's exhausting, honestly.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in facing these memories?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm proud, I think. It's tough, and there are times when I wonder if it's worth it. But I can see small changes. Like, today, I was able to stay with the memory longer than last time. And although it's still intense, I don't feel as overwhelmed as I used to. It's like... I'm slowly regaining some control. But it's frustrating that it's such a slow process.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to those changes?",
    "Client: I guess... practice? And maybe knowing that I'm in a safe space here. Also, learning to ground myself when things get too intense has helped. Oh, and I've been trying that mindfulness app you recommended. It's helping me stay more present in my daily life, which I think is making it easier to face these memories without completely losing myself in them.",
    "Therapist: How has this process affected your view of yourself?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. In some ways, I feel stronger. Like, if I can face these memories, maybe I can face anything. But there are also times when I feel so vulnerable, so broken. I struggle with seeing myself as a survivor rather than a victim. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I don't recognize the person staring back at me. It's like I'm still trying to reconcile who I was before all this with who I am now.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need patience. From myself, mostly. I get so frustrated with the slow pace of healing. And maybe... maybe I need to talk to my partner more about what I'm going through. He wants to help, but I've been keeping him at arm's length. I'm scared of being vulnerable with him, but I know that's probably holding me back. And... I think I need to keep coming here, keep doing this work, as hard as it is. It feels like the only way forward.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. The fear and anger are still there, but they're not as overwhelming. And there's this tiny spark of hope that wasn't there before. It's small, but it's there. I just hope I can hold onto it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on communicating with my partner about all this. And maybe... maybe we could explore some of my refugee experiences? I've been avoiding that, but I think it's all connected. It's scary to think about, but I feel like I'm ready to start facing that part of my past too.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today. We'll pick up there next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but... I'm glad I'm doing this. See you next week."
