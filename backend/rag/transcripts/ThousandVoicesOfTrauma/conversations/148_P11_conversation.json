    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I found out about my wife's passing while I was in prison... it's still so raw, even after all these years. The helplessness, the guilt, the anger... it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that memory?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of isolation, I think. Being trapped behind those walls when I got the news... I couldn't be there for her, couldn't say goodbye. It's like I was robbed of that final moment, you know? And then the guilt hit me like a ton of bricks. If I hadn't been in there, maybe things would've been different.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. My hands were clammy, and I could feel myself tensing up. It's amazing how vivid those physical sensations still are, even though it happened years ago. I... I actually found myself looking around the room at one point, half-expecting to see those prison walls closing in on me again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does it compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, it's definitely more intense during the exposure. But I realize now that I still carry some of those feelings with me every day. The guilt, the helplessness... they're always there in the background, affecting how I interact with people, how I view myself. I've been keeping everyone at arm's length, afraid to get close because... well, because I failed the person I was closest to.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see that I've been punishing myself all these years. Even after serving my time, I've kept myself in a sort of emotional prison. It's like I didn't think I deserved to move on, to be happy. But going through these sessions, facing these memories head-on... it's helping me realize that maybe it's time to start forgiving myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this affect your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's time to start letting people in again. My daughter, my grandkids... I've been keeping them at a distance because I felt I didn't deserve their love. But they're still here, still trying to connect with me. Maybe it's time I stop pushing them away and start rebuilding those relationships. It won't be easy, but I owe it to them... and to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave step. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. This is all new territory for me. I think I'll need help navigating those conversations with my family, learning how to open up again. And maybe... maybe some guidance on how to deal with the guilt when it resurfaces. Because I know it will. I'm just... I'm tired of letting it control my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. Each session feels like I'm ripping open old wounds. But... but I can also see the progress I'm making. It's like I'm finally starting to see a light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. So yeah, I want to keep going. It's scary as hell, but I think it's the only way I'm going to truly move forward.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on the moment I had to tell my daughter about her mother's passing. It's another memory I've been avoiding, but I feel like facing it might help me reconnect with her. It's going to be painful, but if it helps bridge that gap between us, it'll be worth it. I just... I hope I'm strong enough to handle it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength already. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this, for not judging me. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like there might actually be a future for me beyond all this pain and guilt. It's terrifying and exciting all at once. I'm... I'm ready to keep pushing forward, no matter how hard it gets."
