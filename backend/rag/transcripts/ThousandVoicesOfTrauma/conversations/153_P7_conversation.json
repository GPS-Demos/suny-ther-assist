    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about two years ago. I had just returned from my last deployment and was feeling lost. A friend introduced me to this group that promised spiritual enlightenment and purpose. At first, it seemed harmless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The leader, he was charismatic. He'd been in the military too, so I felt a connection. We'd have these intense meditation sessions, sometimes lasting for days. They said it was to \"cleanse our spirits,\" but now I realize it was sleep deprivation.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. How did you feel?",
    "Client: Confused... exhausted. But also, strangely elated. They'd praise us for enduring, saying we were becoming \"pure.\" I remember this one session where I hallucinated my fallen comrades. I thought I was having a spiritual awakening, but...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Thanks. It's hard to talk about. The leader started demanding more and more from us. Money, possessions, cutting ties with family. I gave them my savings, thinking I was investing in my spiritual growth. God, I was so stupid!",
    "Therapist: You weren't stupid. You were vulnerable.",
    "Client: Maybe. But I should have seen the signs. Things got darker. They started talking about a \"final ascension.\" That's when I got scared. I realized we were being prepared for something terrible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: One night, I overheard the leader talking about mass suicide. He said it was the only way to reach true enlightenment. I felt sick. All I could think about were the bodies I'd seen in combat, and now... I couldn't let that happen.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. I felt like I was back in a war zone, but this time the enemy was someone I'd trusted. I knew I had to get out and warn others, but I was afraid. They had so much control over me.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel afraid. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I... I managed to sneak out one night. I called the police, but by the time they arrived, most of the group had scattered. The leader was arrested, but... I can't shake the guilt. What if I'd realized sooner? Could I have saved more people?",
    "Therapist: You did the best you could in a difficult situation.",
    "Client: I know, logically. But emotionally... it's hard. I feel like I failed them, just like I sometimes felt I failed my unit in combat. It's all mixed up in my head now - the war, the cult. Sometimes I can't tell which nightmares are which.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Your experiences are connected.",
    "Client: Yeah... I guess they are. Both times, I was searching for purpose, for belonging. And both times, it led to trauma. I'm afraid to trust now, afraid to believe in anything. How do I move past this?",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're taking important steps now.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, and other times... it's like I'm right back there, in the middle of it all. The guilt, the fear, the anger - it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. You're processing trauma.",
    "Client: I know, but it's exhausting. And lonely. I feel like no one can really understand what I've been through. How do I explain to someone that I've experienced war and nearly been part of a mass suicide cult? It sounds crazy.",
    "Therapist: It's not crazy. Your experiences are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. I just... I want to feel normal again. I want to be able to trust, to form relationships without this constant fear. But every time I start to open up to someone, I panic. I'm afraid they'll either reject me or try to control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. We'll work on rebuilding trust.",
    "Client: I hope so. I miss feeling connected to people. Even with my partner, there's this wall. They're patient, but I know it's hard for them too. I want to let them in, but I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to be scared. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Am I though? Sometimes it feels like I'm just going in circles, reliving the same fears over and over. But... I guess the fact that I can talk about it now is something. A few months ago, I couldn't even say the word 'cult' without having a panic attack.",
