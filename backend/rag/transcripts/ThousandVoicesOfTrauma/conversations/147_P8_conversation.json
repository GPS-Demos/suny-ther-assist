    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Ramirez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm back there, you know? I can still hear her screaming at me, calling me worthless. My hands are trembling a little. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when I close my eyes and really focus on the memory.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight on it. And my stomach is in knots. I keep swallowing, trying to get rid of this lump in my throat. It's like... like I'm that scared little boy again, cowering in the corner while she throws things around the room.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do something? Why didn't I stand up to her?\" I know I was just a child, but part of me still feels like I should have been stronger. And then I feel angry, so angry at her for making me feel this way, even now, decades later.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, punch something? But then it fades, and I just feel... tired. So tired of carrying this around.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you notice that tiredness?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm realizing how much energy it takes to keep reliving these memories. It's exhausting, always being on guard, always expecting the worst. But at the same time, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like, by facing this head-on, I'm finally giving myself permission to let go of some of that tension.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. Tell me more about that sense of relief.",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, I've been running from these memories, you know? Trying to push them down, pretend they didn't happen. But now, talking about it, really experiencing it again in a safe place... it's hard, but it's also like I'm finally acknowledging what happened to me. I'm not minimizing it anymore. And that feels... I don't know, validating, I guess?",
    "Therapist: How does that validation feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's a sadness there, for the child I was. But also a warmth, like I'm finally being kind to myself. I've spent so long blaming myself, thinking I was weak or stupid for not fighting back. But now I can see that I was just a kid, doing the best I could to survive.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice as you have that realization?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like a weight is starting to lift. My breathing is easier, and the knot in my stomach is loosening a bit. There's still fear there, and pain, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before. It's like... like I'm starting to see a way forward, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that way forward look to you?",
    "Client: It's... it's not clear yet. But I can imagine a future where these memories don't control me anymore. Where I can think about my childhood without feeling paralyzed by fear and shame. I want to be able to talk to my grandkids without this constant anxiety that I'm somehow going to mess them up like I was messed up. I want to... to feel whole again.",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up as you picture that future?",
    "Client: Hope, I think. And a little bit of excitement, even. It's scary to think about changing after all these years, but... I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I want to live, really live, you know? I want to enjoy my retirement, make new friends at the senior center without always worrying that they'll somehow see how broken I am inside.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express that desire?",
    "Client: I... I feel stronger. My posture is straighter, and I'm breathing deeper. My hands have stopped shaking. There's still a heaviness in my chest, but it's not as crushing as before. It's like... like I'm starting to believe that maybe I can do this. Maybe I can heal.",
    "Therapist: What's this moment like for you?",
    "Client: It's... intense. I feel vulnerable, like I've been cracked open. But also... real. More real than I've felt in a long time. I'm scared of what other memories might come up, but I'm also... I don't know, curious? Like maybe by facing this, I can finally understand myself better. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, for sure. But I think... I think I'm ready. It's not going to be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is, right? I want to keep going. I want to see where this leads. I want to... I want to finally be free of this weight I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path. See you next week."
