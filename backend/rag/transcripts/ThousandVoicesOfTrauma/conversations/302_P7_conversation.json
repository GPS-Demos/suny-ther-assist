    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the medical trauma you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about two years ago when I was still living in my home country. I had been feeling unwell for weeks, and finally decided to go to the hospital. The waiting room was crowded, and I remember feeling so dizzy and weak. When they finally called my name, I could barely stand up. As I walked into the examination room, everything started to spin, and I collapsed. I woke up surrounded by doctors and nurses, all speaking rapidly in a language I barely understood. They were attaching wires and tubes to me, and I felt so confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to ask what was happening, but no one seemed to hear me. The lights were so bright, and there was this constant beeping sound. I remember feeling like I couldn't breathe properly. A doctor came over and started explaining something, but I couldn't focus on his words. All I could think about was how I might die here, alone in this strange place, without my family knowing what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It's hard to talk about this. I felt so helpless and vulnerable. They kept poking me with needles, and I didn't know what medications they were giving me. I was in and out of consciousness, and each time I woke up, I felt more disoriented. The worst part was when they told me I needed emergency surgery. I didn't fully understand why, and I was terrified of what might happen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The surgery itself is a blur, but I remember waking up afterward in so much pain. I couldn't move, and I had all these tubes coming out of me. I felt like I had lost control of my own body. The recovery was slow and painful, and I kept having nightmares about being trapped in that hospital bed. Even after I was discharged, I couldn't shake the feeling of helplessness and fear. It's like a part of me is still stuck in that hospital room, scared and alone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing it.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) Sometimes I still have panic attacks when I smell anything that reminds me of the hospital. I avoid medical check-ups now, even though I know it's not good for my health. I feel so ashamed that I can't handle simple things like going to a doctor's office anymore. It's affecting my life here as a refugee too. I'm supposed to have regular health screenings, but I keep putting them off because I'm so afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part is the guilt. I feel like I should be stronger, especially for my family. They've been through so much already with our refugee experience, and now they have to deal with my fears too. My husband tries to understand, but I can see the frustration in his eyes when I refuse to go for check-ups. I worry that one day, something serious will happen to me because I'm too scared to seek medical help, and then I'll be leaving my family alone. But every time I think about going to a hospital, I feel this overwhelming panic. It's like I'm right back there, helpless and afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What you're feeling is normal.",
    "Client: (sighing) I know I need to overcome this fear, but it feels impossible sometimes. The memories are so vivid, and the fear is so real. I want to be able to take care of my health without feeling this overwhelming anxiety. I want to be strong for my family and set a good example for my grandchildren. But right now, it feels like this fear is controlling my life. I'm tired of feeling this way, but I don't know how to move past it.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress by talking about it. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be the person who panics at the sight of a hospital? Will I ever be able to trust doctors again? I feel like I've lost a part of myself, and I don't know how to get it back. But being here, talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like maybe there's hope. Maybe I can learn to manage this fear and not let it control me anymore. I just want to feel like myself again, to be able to take care of my health without this constant dread hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is still difficult, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before. There's still a lot of fear and anxiety, but I also feel a small sense of accomplishment for being able to discuss it without having a full-blown panic attack. I'm realizing that maybe, with time and help, I can learn to manage these feelings better. It's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's wrap up for today."
