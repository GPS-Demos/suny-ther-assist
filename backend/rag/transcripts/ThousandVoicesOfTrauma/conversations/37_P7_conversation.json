    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and recall the bullying incident. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the school cafeteria. It's loud, and I can smell the food. I'm sitting alone at a table, trying to eat my lunch. I see a group of girls approaching, and my stomach tightens. They're laughing and pointing at me. One of them, the leader, she's tall with blonde hair. She's saying something about my clothes, mocking my traditional dress. I feel so small and exposed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The blonde girl is getting closer. She's speaking loudly now, making sure everyone can hear. \"Hey, curry girl! Did your mom make that ugly dress for you?\" The other girls are laughing. I can feel my face getting hot, and my eyes are starting to water. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I try to ignore them, but they won't stop. The blonde girl reaches over and tugs at my sleeve, saying, \"What is this, a tablecloth?\" More laughter. I can see other students watching, some look uncomfortable, but no one says anything. I feel so alone and different. Why can't I just fit in?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I stand up, thinking I'll just leave, but the blonde girl blocks my path. She's smirking at me. \"Where are you going, curry girl? Back to your smelly house?\" I feel trapped. My heart is racing, and I'm struggling to breathe. I want to say something, to stand up for myself, but the words won't come out. I feel weak and pathetic.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great expressing these difficult emotions.",
    "Client: I finally manage to push past her, but as I'm walking away, I hear her yell, \"Go back to where you came from!\" The cafeteria erupts in laughter. I'm running now, tears streaming down my face. I lock myself in a bathroom stall, trying to muffle my sobs. I feel so ashamed, not just of being bullied, but of my culture, my family, everything that makes me different. I wish I could just disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My chest feels tight, and I'm a bit shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's hard to talk about, but it feels good to let it out.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still painful to remember, but I think I understand now how much that experience affected me. I've carried that shame for so long, always trying to fit in, to be \"less Asian.\" But talking about it... it's like I can see it more clearly now. Those girls were cruel, but it wasn't my fault. I didn't deserve that.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, I think. Like a weight is lifting. I've spent so much time trying to be someone else, to hide parts of myself. But I'm starting to see that I don't need to do that. My culture, my background - they're not something to be ashamed of. They're part of who I am.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: I think I am. It's still hard, and I know I have a long way to go. But for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful. Like maybe I can learn to be proud of who I am, all of me. And maybe I can help other kids who are going through similar experiences. I don't want anyone else to feel the way I did in that cafeteria.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful goal. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that's good. I feel exhausted, but in a good way. Like I've really accomplished something today. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
