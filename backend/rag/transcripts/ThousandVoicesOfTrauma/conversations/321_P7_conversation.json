    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion, starting from the moment you first noticed something was wrong?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my living room, reading a book. It was around 9 PM, and I heard a strange noise coming from the back door. At first, I thought it might be my husband, but then I remembered he was out of town. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I put my book down and stood up, feeling scared. The noise got louder, and I realized someone was trying to force the door open. I froze, not knowing what to do. Then I heard a loud crash, and the door flew open. Two men burst in, wearing dark clothes and masks. I screamed...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What did you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. My legs felt weak, and I couldn't move. One of the men shouted at me to shut up, and I just stood there, trembling. I thought they were going to kill me...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shorter man grabbed my arm roughly and pushed me onto the couch. He told me not to move or make a sound. The other one started ransacking the house, opening drawers and cupboards. I could hear things crashing and breaking. I felt so helpless and violated...",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frightening. What happened next?",
    "Client: They kept asking where I kept my valuables. I told them about the safe in the bedroom, hoping they'd leave me alone. The taller one went to check, while the other one stayed with me. He had a knife... I couldn't stop staring at it...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is hard. (deep breath) The man with the knife kept threatening me, saying he'd hurt me if I tried anything. I just sat there, crying silently. I could hear the other man tearing apart our bedroom. It felt like it went on forever...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Finally, the other man came back with our safe and some jewelry. They started arguing about whether to take me with them. I was paralyzed with fear. Then we heard a car pulling up outside - it was our neighbor coming home. The men panicked and ran out the back door...",
    "Therapist: How did you feel when they left?",
    "Client: Relief... but also shock. I couldn't move for a while. I just sat there, shaking and sobbing. When I finally got up to call the police, my legs were so weak I almost fell. I felt so vulnerable and violated. Our home didn't feel safe anymore...",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Anxious and sad. Reliving it brings back those feelings of helplessness. But... I also feel a bit stronger for being able to talk about it. It's still hard, though.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I keep thinking about how it could have been worse if our neighbor hadn't come home. Sometimes I still have nightmares about what might have happened...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those thoughts. Let's focus on what did happen.",
    "Client: You're right. The reality was bad enough. After they left, I managed to call the police. They came quickly, but the men were long gone. My husband rushed home when I called him. I felt so guilty for not being able to protect our home...",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. How did you cope in the following days?",
    "Client: It was tough. I couldn't sleep well for weeks. Every little noise made me jump. My husband installed a security system, but I still felt on edge. I started seeing a therapist then, which helped a bit. But it's been a long journey...",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now, compared to then?",
    "Client: Better, definitely. But there are still moments when I feel scared in my own home. Especially when I'm alone. I've learned some coping strategies, but the fear never completely goes away. Being here, talking about it, helps though.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. Sometimes I feel silly for still being affected by it after all this time. But I'm trying to be patient with myself and acknowledge how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for listening and for your support. It really does make a difference.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session. Take care."
