    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's been years since I've allowed myself to think about that time in such detail. The imprisonment during the natural disaster... it all felt so real again. I could almost feel the dampness of the makeshift shelter, hear the chaos outside. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I remember feeling so utterly powerless. We were trapped for days, not knowing if help would come. The uncertainty was... it was suffocating. And the guilt... oh, the guilt of surviving when others didn't. It's like a weight I've carried all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, lurking. Sometimes, when I'm enjoying a moment with my grandchildren or even just a peaceful day, it creeps in. I question why I get to have this life when others lost theirs. It makes it hard to fully embrace joy, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. How did revisiting the memory feel different today?",
    "Client: Well, it was still difficult, but... I noticed I could breathe through it better this time. There were moments when I felt I could step back a little, observe the memory rather than be completely consumed by it. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it might be. It's the first time I've felt any sense of control when thinking about that experience. But it's also stirred up so much. The sounds of the storm, the cries of people... they seem louder now. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many find memories become more vivid initially. How are you managing that?",
    "Client: I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we discussed. Focusing on my breath, reminding myself I'm safe now. But it's hard. Sometimes I worry that by remembering, I'm somehow disrespecting those who didn't make it. Is it okay to... to try to heal?",
    "Therapist: What would you say to a friend with similar concerns?",
    "Client: I... I'd probably tell them that healing doesn't mean forgetting. That those who didn't survive would want us to find peace. But it's so much harder to apply that to myself. I keep thinking about my late husband, how he struggled after we were rescued. He never really talked about it. I wonder if I'm betraying him somehow by doing this therapy.",
    "Therapist: How might working through this honor his memory?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. Maybe... maybe by healing, I can be more present for our family, share the good memories of him more freely. He always wanted me to be happy. Perhaps this is a way of fulfilling his wish. It's just... it's so hard to let go of the pain. It's been a part of me for so long.",
    "Therapist: What small step might help you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start by sharing one positive memory of him with our grandchildren each week. Something from before the disaster. It might help balance out the heaviness I've been carrying. And perhaps... perhaps I could visit the memorial we have in our community. I've always avoided it, but maybe it's time to face it.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... there's a small part of me that feels ready. Like maybe I owe it to myself, and to those we lost, to try. I just... I hope I'm strong enough.",
    "Therapist: What gives you strength?",
    "Client: My family, definitely. And... I suppose this therapy, as difficult as it is. There's a tiny glimmer of hope now that wasn't there before. And maybe... maybe the resilience I showed during the disaster itself. If I could survive that, perhaps I can face these memories too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, but I think I'm ready. Each session, while challenging, leaves me feeling a bit lighter. Like I'm slowly unpacking a heavy suitcase I've been carrying for decades. I just hope... I hope I can find some peace at the end of this journey.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel drained, but in a different way than before. Like I've done something important, even if it was difficult. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like there might be light at the end of this long, dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to practice those grounding techniques we talked about. See you next week."
