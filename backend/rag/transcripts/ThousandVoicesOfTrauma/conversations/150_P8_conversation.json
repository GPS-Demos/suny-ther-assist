    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is buzzing. The memory of that earthquake... it's so vivid now. I can still feel the ground moving beneath my feet, hear the rumbling... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... a strange sense of guilt? I know it doesn't make sense, but I keep thinking about the people who didn't make it out. Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. I remember running out of my apartment building, and there was this elderly couple struggling to get down the stairs. I wanted to help them, but I just... I just kept running. I was so scared. And now, I can't stop wondering if they made it out okay. What if they didn't? What if I could have saved them?",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. How does your body feel when you think about that moment?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight, like I can't swallow. And my hands... they're clammy and shaky. It's like my body is reliving that panic all over again.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing this voice in my head saying, \"You're a coward. You should have helped them.\" And then another part of me is arguing back, \"But you were just trying to survive.\" It's like this constant battle in my mind.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first experienced the earthquake?",
    "Client: They're... they're actually less intense now. Back then, I couldn't even process what was happening. It was pure, blind panic. Now, it's still scary, but I can at least think about it without completely falling apart. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I guess it is progress. It's just... it's hard to feel good about it when the memory is still so painful. But you're right, I am able to talk about it now. Before, I couldn't even mention earthquakes without having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. There's a tiny bit of pride, I suppose. Like, \"Hey, I'm getting stronger.\" But there's also this fear that if I let go of the pain, I'm somehow dishonoring those who didn't survive. And then there's this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I won't always feel this broken.",
    "Therapist: Can you explore that feeling of hope a bit more?",
    "Client: It's like... a small light in all this darkness. For so long, I've felt trapped by this experience, defined by it. But being able to talk about it, to face it... it's like I'm starting to see a way out. Maybe I can learn to live with this memory without letting it control me. It's scary, but also... kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: What does that possibility mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means I might have a future that isn't overshadowed by this trauma. That I might be able to help others who've been through similar experiences. Maybe even... maybe even forgive myself for not being able to help everyone that day. Is that... is that okay to want?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I think it is okay. I think it's what I need to do to heal. It doesn't mean I'm forgetting what happened or dismissing the suffering of others. It means I'm choosing to live, to make something positive out of this horrible experience. That realization... it actually makes me feel a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: The shaking has subsided a bit. My breathing is slower, more regular. There's still this knot in my stomach, but it's not as tight as before. It's like... it's like my body is starting to relax, just a little.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you notice these changes?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I'm stronger than I realized. Maybe I can handle this. It's still scary, and I know there's a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like... like maybe I'll be okay. Is this... is this what healing feels like?",
    "Therapist: What does healing mean to you?",
    "Client: Healing... I think it means learning to live with what happened, rather than trying to forget it or let it control me. It means acknowledging the pain and the fear, but not letting them define me. It means... it means finding a way to move forward, to find meaning and purpose despite what I've been through. And maybe... maybe even using this experience to help others who are struggling.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Scary, but right. Like I'm finally starting to see a path forward. I know it won't be easy, and I'm sure there will be setbacks, but... I think I'm ready to try. To really commit to this healing process, no matter how challenging it might be.",
    "Therapist: What's the next step for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to start talking about this more. Not just here in therapy, but maybe with my partner, or even consider joining a support group for earthquake survivors. And... and I want to learn more about disaster preparedness. Maybe if I feel more prepared, it'll help with some of this anxiety.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about those ideas?",
    "Client: They're intimidating, but also... empowering? Like I'm taking control back. It's a mix of nervousness and excitement. But mostly, I feel... I feel hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, I can turn this terrible experience into something meaningful. Is that... is that too optimistic?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I don't think it is too optimistic. I think it's exactly what I need right now. A sense of hope, a goal to work towards. It doesn't erase what happened, but it gives me a reason to keep pushing forward. And that... that feels really good.",
    "Therapist: We're nearing the end of our session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... surprisingly okay. Tired, definitely, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying. There's still fear and sadness, but also this new sense of possibility. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like I can face it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how I can start sharing this experience with others. Maybe we could work on strategies for talking to my partner about it? And also, I'd like to delve deeper into this guilt I'm feeling. I think that's still a big hurdle for me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I've said it before, but I really mean it. This process is hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. I'm grateful for your guidance and support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
