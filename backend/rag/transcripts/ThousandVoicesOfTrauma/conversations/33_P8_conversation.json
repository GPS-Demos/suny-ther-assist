    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. The memory of that night, seeing my father... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the sounds of glass breaking and my mother's muffled cries. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: Well, my heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like I'm right back there, hiding in the closet, terrified of what might happen next. I keep telling myself I'm safe now, but my body doesn't seem to believe it.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do something?\" I was just a child, but part of me still feels guilty for not helping my mother. And then I feel angry, so angry at my father for putting us through that. But mostly, I feel... helpless. Like that little girl who couldn't change anything. It's frustrating because I know I'm not that child anymore, but in moments like this, it's hard to remember that.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: They're... less intense, I suppose. Before, I couldn't even talk about that night without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still difficult, but I can at least put it into words. The guilt and anger are still there, but they don't consume me like they used to. It's like... I'm starting to see it from a different perspective. I'm beginning to understand that it wasn't my fault, that I was just a child caught in a terrible situation. But it's still a struggle to fully believe that.",
    "Therapist: What's helping you manage these emotions right now?",
    "Client: I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we've practiced. Focusing on my breath, reminding myself that I'm here in this room, not back in that house. And... I'm trying to be kind to myself, to that little girl who was so scared. It's hard, but I'm trying to tell her that she did the best she could. Sometimes it helps to imagine hugging her, telling her it's not her fault. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does it feel to show compassion to your younger self?",
    "Client: It's... surprisingly comforting. For so long, I've been angry at that little girl, blaming her. But when I try to be gentle with her, it's like a weight lifts a little. It doesn't erase what happened, but it makes it a bit easier to bear. I just wish... I wish I could have protected her, you know? But I guess in a way, by working through this now, maybe I am protecting her, or at least honoring what she went through.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, my breathing is slowing down a bit. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. And I'm realizing that even though remembering is painful, I can tolerate it. I'm not falling apart. That's... that's new for me. It's like, maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does recognizing that strength feel?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, I suppose. Like maybe I'm not just a victim of my past anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's still scary and overwhelming at times, but there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope maybe? That I can face this and come out the other side. It's both exciting and terrifying. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, but another part knows that facing them is the only way forward. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now as you process this?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remind myself that it's okay to take this slowly. That healing isn't linear, and some days will be harder than others. And maybe... maybe I need to acknowledge how far I've come. It's easy to focus on how much it still hurts, but the fact that I can sit here and talk about it without completely falling apart... that's progress, isn't it? I guess I need to be patient with myself, to allow myself to feel whatever comes up without judgment. And to remember that I'm not alone in this anymore. That's... that's really important to me.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my daughter when I get home. Just hearing her voice always helps ground me. And maybe I'll take a long bath, try to relax my body a bit. I've been working on that self-care list we made, so I might do some gentle yoga or listen to some calming music. And I'll make sure to eat something nurturing \u2013 I tend to lose my appetite after sessions like this, but I know it's important to take care of my body. Is there... is there anything else you'd recommend?",
    "Therapist: Those all sound like excellent ideas. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some important work today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe it's worth it. I just hope... I hope one day these memories won't have such a hold on me. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Many find that with time and work, the impact lessens. How are you feeling about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It's still scary, but I feel like I'm making progress. And knowing that you'll be here to guide me through it helps. I'm committed to this process, even when it's tough. So, I guess I'm looking forward to it, in a way. Is it okay if I call if things get overwhelming between now and then?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Do you have any other questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm okay for now. Thank you for today. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I'll see you next week, and I'll make sure to practice those grounding techniques we talked about. Take care.",
    "Therapist: You too. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
