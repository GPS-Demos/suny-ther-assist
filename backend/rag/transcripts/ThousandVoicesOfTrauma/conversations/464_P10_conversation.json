    "Therapist: Welcome, Arjun. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. There's a part of me that wants to do this, but another part that's really scared. My stomach feels tight, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's hot, so hot. The air is thick with dust and... and the smell of too many people crammed together. I can hear children crying in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the tents. Rows and rows of white tents, but they're not really white anymore. They're stained and torn. People are everywhere, just... sitting, waiting. I'm standing in line for water. The line is so long, and I'm so thirsty.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My throat feels dry. My feet ache from standing for so long. I'm sweating, but I feel cold at the same time. It's like... like my body doesn't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: There's a man ahead of me in line. He looks... he looks angry. He's yelling at the aid worker. I can't understand what he's saying, but his face is red, and he's gesturing wildly. I'm... I'm scared he might do something.",
    "Therapist: What's happening now?",
    "Client: The man is getting more agitated. He's... he's pushing people. Oh god, he's coming towards me. I want to run, but there's nowhere to go. Everyone's pressed so close together.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my shirt. He's screaming in my face. I can smell the desperation on his breath. I'm frozen. I can't move. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I manage to break free. I'm stumbling backwards. People are shouting now. It's chaos. I fall to the ground, and... and I can feel the rough, hot sand on my hands. Someone steps on my fingers as they're trying to get away.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The pain in my hand. The grit in my mouth from the dust. I'm... I'm so scared. I can hear the aid workers shouting for order, but no one's listening. Everyone's pushing and shoving now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I manage to crawl away from the crowd. My clothes are torn, and I'm covered in dirt. I make it to the edge of the camp, near the fence. I can see... I can see the desert stretching out beyond. It looks so empty, so hopeless.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel so alone. So small. Like I don't matter to anyone. Like I could disappear, and no one would notice or care.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very difficult. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yeah... okay. I'm... I'm sitting by the fence. My whole body hurts. I can taste blood in my mouth. I must have bit my lip during the chaos. The sun is setting, and it's... it's beautiful, actually. But it feels wrong to think that when everything else is so awful.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The sky is turning orange and pink. It's... it's so different from the drab colors of the camp. I can hear people settling down for the night. The shouting has stopped, but there's this... this undercurrent of tension. Like everyone's holding their breath, waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Physically and emotionally. My muscles ache. I feel... I feel dirty, inside and out. There's this weight on my chest, like... like I'll never be happy again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As it gets darker, I... I start to feel more afraid. I don't want to go back to the tent. I don't want to be around people. But I'm scared to be alone too. I... I curl up against the fence. The metal is cool against my back. I can hear... I can hear someone crying nearby. It's soft, like they're trying to hide it.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about home. About my family. I wonder if they're okay, if they made it out too. I feel so guilty for being here when they might not be safe. And I... I hate myself for feeling relieved that I'm here and not there.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of complex emotions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As the night goes on, it gets colder. I'm shivering, but I don't want to move. Someone... someone comes by with blankets. They drape one over me without saying anything. It's... it's a small kindness, but it makes me want to cry.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful, I guess. But also... also more alone somehow. Like, this stranger cared enough to give me a blanket, but they didn't stay. They didn't ask if I was okay. No one does.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I eventually fall into a restless sleep. I keep jerking awake, thinking I hear shouting or fighting. Each time I open my eyes, I have this moment of... of hope that it was all a dream. But then I see the tents, feel the hard ground, and... and reality crashes back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels stronger, like... like if I survived that night, I can survive anything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm here. In your office. I can feel the chair under me. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. There's a sense of relief? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now... now it's a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was... it was hard. But I think... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll end our session here. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Arjun. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
