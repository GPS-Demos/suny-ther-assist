    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control and safe here. Can you start describing the memory of your severe illness?",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. I remember being in the hospital bed, feeling so weak and scared. The room was cold, and the beeping of the machines was constant. I felt so alone, even though my wife was there. The doctors kept coming in and out, but no one seemed to have answers.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember the pain in my chest, it was like nothing I'd ever felt before. I couldn't breathe properly, and each breath felt like a struggle. I kept thinking about my kids at home, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. You're being very brave sharing this.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about. I felt so helpless, like my body was betraying me. The nurses were kind, but I could see the concern in their eyes. I overheard them talking about my condition, and it sounded serious. I wanted to ask questions, but I was too afraid of the answers.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I remember my wife trying to comfort me, but I could see she was terrified too. She tried to hide it, but I knew. I felt guilty for putting her through this. The nights were the worst. I couldn't sleep, constantly worried that I might not wake up if I closed my eyes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The doctors finally came in with a diagnosis. It was like time stood still. I could see their mouths moving, but I couldn't process the words. My wife started crying, and that's when it hit me how serious it was. I felt a wave of panic wash over me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started thinking about all the things I might never get to do. See my kids grow up, grow old with my wife, achieve my career goals. It was like my whole future was slipping away. I felt so angry at my body, at the doctors, at the world. Why was this happening to me?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're handling this memory well.",
    "Client: The treatment was brutal. I was in so much pain, and the side effects were horrible. I lost weight, my hair fell out, I was constantly nauseous. I felt like a shell of myself. My colleagues visited once, and I could see the shock on their faces. I felt ashamed, like I was letting everyone down.",
    "Therapist: You're being incredibly strong. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The recovery was slow and frustrating. Every small improvement felt like a huge victory, but then there would be setbacks. It was an emotional rollercoaster. I struggled with feeling dependent on others, it challenged my sense of who I was. Even after I was discharged, the fear of relapse haunted me. It still does sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's intense reliving it all. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced it head-on. It's still scary, but talking about it makes it feel less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. It's always been easier to try and forget, you know? But I can see how facing it might help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your guidance through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I think I'll sleep better tonight, having gotten some of this off my chest. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time. Take care of yourself."
