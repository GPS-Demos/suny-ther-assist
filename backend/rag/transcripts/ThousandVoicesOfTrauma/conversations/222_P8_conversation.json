    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I can still hear the glass breaking downstairs. I keep picturing those men in our living room, and... (takes a deep breath) I feel so vulnerable all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that they invaded our space, that they made me feel so powerless in my own home. It's not fair, you know? We're supposed to feel safe at home.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Where do you feel that fear and anger in your body?",
    "Client: The fear is like this tight knot in my stomach. It's making me feel a bit nauseous, actually. And the anger... it's in my chest. It's hot, like it wants to burst out. My hands are shaking a little too. I don't know if that's the fear or the anger or both.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if they come back?\" And then I feel guilty because I'm not there to protect my parents. I know it's irrational, but I can't shake this feeling that I should be doing something, anything, to keep them safe. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're overreacting. It's been months. Get over it.\" But I can't. I just can't.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense, I guess. When it first happened, I couldn't sleep for days. I jumped at every little sound. Now, it's more like... a constant low-level anxiety? But when I really think about it, like during this exercise, it all comes flooding back. It's like... like I'm right back there, hiding in my closet, praying they won't come upstairs.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to cope now versus then?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm doing better. I mean, I can talk about it now without completely falling apart. And I've learned some techniques to calm myself down when I start to panic. But it still feels overwhelming sometimes, you know? Like I'll never fully feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your view of the world?",
    "Client: God, where do I start? I used to think bad things only happened to other people. Now, I'm constantly on edge, always looking over my shoulder. I've become so distrustful. And I hate that. I hate that they took away my sense of security, my ability to just... relax and enjoy life. It's like the world went from being this mostly safe place to this unpredictable, dangerous one overnight.",
    "Therapist: What's helped you feel more secure since the incident?",
    "Client: Um, well, therapy obviously. (gives a small laugh) But also... my parents installed a better security system. That helps a bit. And I've been trying to rebuild my social connections. Being around friends, even if I don't tell them everything, it... it reminds me that there's still good in the world, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you see yourself moving forward from here?",
    "Client: I... I want to be stronger. I don't want this to define me forever. Sometimes I can picture a future where this is just something that happened to me, not something that controls me. But other times... it feels impossible. Like I'll always be the girl who hid in the closet while her home was invaded. I guess I'm still trying to figure out how to reconcile those two versions of myself.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week towards that stronger version of yourself?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe... maybe I could try sleeping with my bedroom door open? I've been keeping it locked since it happened, and I know it bothers my parents. It's a small thing, but... it feels like it could be a start, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that step make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. There's this voice in my head saying it's not safe. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? Like I'm taking back some control. It's scary, but also... maybe a little exciting? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What else comes up for you when you think about making that change?",
    "Client: I guess... hope? Like, if I can do this, maybe I can do other things too. Maybe I can start going out more, or even think about moving out eventually. It's like... like seeing a tiny light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel. But it's there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. How can you hold onto that feeling of hope?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I need to remind myself of it every day? Like, write it down or something? Or maybe talk to my parents about it. They've been so supportive, and I know they worry. It might be good for them to see that I'm trying to move forward too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. Is there anything else you want to explore about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. This was hard, but... good, I think. It's like, by facing it head-on, I'm taking some of its power away? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: Tired, definitely. But also... lighter, maybe? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. I know it's not over, and I'll probably have to pick that bag up again, but... for now, it feels good to have set it down for a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a great way to end our session. Thank you for your courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really. I... I think I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this."
