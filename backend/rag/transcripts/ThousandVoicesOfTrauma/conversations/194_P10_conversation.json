    "Therapist: Welcome back, Raj. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about the police brutality incident always makes me tense up. But I know it's important, so I'm trying to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking home from work. It's late, maybe around 10 PM. The streets are pretty quiet, just a few people here and there. I can hear my footsteps echoing off the buildings. It's... it's a bit chilly, and I pull my jacket tighter around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear a police siren in the distance. It's getting closer. My heart starts racing a bit. I... I don't know why, but I feel nervous. The siren stops, but I can see the flashing lights reflecting off the windows of the buildings nearby.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: I see a police car pull up beside me. Two officers get out. They're... they're walking towards me. One of them says, \"Hey, you! Stop right there!\" I freeze. I don't know what to do. My hands are shaking. I can feel sweat starting to form on my forehead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My mouth is dry. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. I want to run, but I know that would make things worse. I... I manage to stammer out, \"Is... is there a problem, officers?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Keep going.",
    "Client: They... they come closer. One of them grabs my arm roughly. He says, \"Where were you coming from? What's in your bag?\" I try to explain that I'm just coming home from work, but my voice is shaking. The other officer starts going through my bag without asking. I feel... I feel violated. Helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The officer holding my arm twists it behind my back. It hurts. I cry out in pain, but he just says, \"Shut up!\" I... I can smell his breath. It's... it's like coffee and cigarettes. The other officer is still rifling through my bag. He pulls out my work ID and laptop. He looks at the ID, then at me, then back at the ID.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Scared. Humiliated. People are starting to stop and stare. I can hear whispers. I want to explain, to defend myself, but I'm afraid of making things worse. My legs are shaking. I... I think I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Raj. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The officer with my ID says something to his partner. I can't quite hear what. The one holding my arm loosens his grip a little. He says, \"Why didn't you say you worked at the tech company?\" I... I try to explain that I did, that I told them I was coming from work, but my words come out jumbled. I'm still shaking.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they let me go. Just like that. No apology, no explanation. The one who had my arm just says, \"You can go now.\" They get back in their car and drive off. I'm... I'm left standing there, holding my bag, surrounded by strangers who are all staring at me. I feel... I feel so small. So powerless.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in the office with me.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm... I'm still on the street. People are starting to walk away, but I can hear them murmuring. Some look sympathetic, others just curious. I... I can't move. My legs feel like lead. I'm trying not to cry, but I can feel tears stinging my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to start walking. My movements are stiff, robotic. I keep looking over my shoulder, afraid the police might come back. Every car that passes makes me flinch. I... I feel like everyone is staring at me, judging me. When I finally get to my apartment building, my hands are shaking so much I can barely get my key in the lock.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also wired. My heart is still racing. I... I feel dirty, like I need to shower, even though they barely touched me. I'm... I'm angry. At the police, at myself for not standing up for myself more, at the world for letting this happen.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. What do you do when you get inside?",
    "Client: I... I lock the door behind me. Double-check it. Then I just... I just slide down to the floor, my back against the door. I can't stop shaking. I... I start to cry. Not loudly, just... silent tears. I feel so alone. So scared. I keep replaying the incident in my head, wondering what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *deep breath* I... I finally get up. I go to the bathroom and splash water on my face. When I look in the mirror, I hardly recognize myself. My eyes are red, my face is pale. I... I feel like a different person. Like something fundamental has changed.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about all the times I've heard about police brutality on the news. How I always thought, \"That won't happen to me. I'm a professional. I follow the rules.\" But now... now I know it can happen to anyone. I feel... I feel vulnerable. Exposed. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... angry. Sad. Scared. But also... also determined. I don't want to let this break me. I want to do something, to speak out. But I'm also afraid. What if it happens again? What if it's worse next time?",
    "Therapist: These are all normal reactions. How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe to 75.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm... I'm here. In the office with you.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Raj. You did great today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... also a little relieved. Like I've let out something that's been bottled up inside me.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an exposure session. Let's take a few minutes to decompress and discuss what you experienced."
