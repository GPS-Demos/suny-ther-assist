    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving those experiences from when I first came here as a refugee... it's overwhelming. I'm already dealing with chronic pain, and I'm worried this might make everything worse.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your worries?",
    "Client: Well, I'm afraid that if I start thinking about what happened, I won't be able to stop. Those memories of leaving my home, the journey here, the uncertainty... it's all so vivid. And with my pain condition, I'm worried the stress might trigger a flare-up. Plus, I'm living with roommates now, and I don't want to burden them with my issues.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How can we make this feel safer for you?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could we have a way to stop if it gets too intense? And is there anything I can do to manage my pain if it gets worse during this process?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use a signal to pause anytime. For pain, let's discuss coping strategies.",
    "Client: That helps a bit. I've been using some breathing techniques for my pain. Could those be useful here too? And... I'm curious, how exactly does reliving these memories help? It seems counterintuitive to purposely think about things I've been trying to avoid.",
    "Therapist: Great question. Exposure helps process memories and reduce their power. Your breathing techniques will be valuable.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, I suppose. It's just... as a man, I feel like I should be able to handle this on my own. In my culture, we don't really talk about these things. It's hard for me to open up, especially to a woman, even though I know you're a professional.",
    "Therapist: Your cultural perspective is important. How can we honor that while working together?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking that. Maybe we could approach it more like... problem-solving? That feels more comfortable to me than just talking about feelings. And perhaps you could explain the scientific basis for this treatment? That might help me feel more at ease with the process.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. I'll frame our work as problem-solving and explain the neuroscience behind exposure therapy.",
    "Client: Thank you, that does help. One more thing - I'm worried about how this might affect my work. I'm still new at my job, and I can't afford to let this impact my performance. Will I be able to function normally after our sessions?",
    "Therapist: Valid concern. We'll end sessions with grounding exercises to help you transition.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It's strange, I feel nervous but also a bit hopeful. Maybe facing these memories head-on will help me move forward in other areas of my life too. I've been feeling stuck for so long.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I'm trying to remind myself that this is a step towards healing, even if it's difficult. I'm grateful for your guidance through this process. Let's start with the relaxation exercise, and then... I guess I'll be ready to face these memories."
