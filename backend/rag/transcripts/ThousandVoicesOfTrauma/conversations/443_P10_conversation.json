    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Aziz. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've been working up to this, but now that we're here, I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on a scale of 0-100?",
    "Client: I'd say it's about a 60 right now. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's start with some deep breaths. When you're ready, begin describing the event.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It was a Tuesday evening. I remember because I had just gotten home from my weekly squash game with colleagues. I was tired, but in a good mood. As I walked into the house, I could feel the tension. It was... palpable. Like a thick fog.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see my wife, Amira, standing in the kitchen. She's gripping the counter so hard her knuckles are white. There's a broken plate on the floor. I... I can smell dinner burning.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I ask her what's wrong, but I already know. It's the same argument we've been having for months. About my long work hours, about how I'm never home. But this time... this time it's different. Her eyes are... they're wild. Filled with a rage I've never seen before.",
    "Therapist: Stay in the present tense. What's happening now?",
    "Client: She's... she's screaming at me. Telling me I'm a failure as a husband, as a father. I try to calm her down, but my words seem to make it worse. She's... oh God, she's picking up the pieces of the broken plate.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 75? My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: She's... she's throwing the pieces at me. One grazes my cheek. I feel a sharp sting, and warm blood trickles down. I'm... I'm in shock. I can't believe this is happening. Our children... they're upstairs. I can hear them crying.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. I've never hit a woman in my life, but I feel this... this urge to defend myself. Instead, I... I grab her wrists. I'm trying to stop her from throwing more, but she's thrashing, screaming. I'm terrified the neighbors will hear, that they'll call the police.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... ashamed. Angry. Scared. I'm supposed to be the man of the house, but I feel so powerless. I... I let go of her wrists and step back. She collapses to the floor, sobbing. I'm frozen, just staring at her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I... I kneel down beside her. I want to comfort her, but I'm afraid to touch her. She looks up at me, and her eyes... they're full of fear and regret. It's like she's seeing me for the first time. She whispers, \"What have we become?\"",
    "Therapist: How do you respond?",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to say. I just sit there, on the cold kitchen floor, amidst the broken ceramic and the smell of burnt food. I hear our children's footsteps upstairs. They're scared to come down. I feel like I've failed everyone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I help Amira up. We don't speak. I clean up the mess while she goes to check on the kids. The silence is... it's deafening. I keep replaying the moment in my head, wondering how we got here. How I let things get this bad.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about my father. How he always preached about being a strong man, about never showing weakness. But right now, I feel anything but strong. I feel... broken. Like I've let down generations of men in my family.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... After cleaning up, I go upstairs. The kids are in their rooms, doors closed. Amira's sitting on our bed, staring at nothing. I... I sit beside her, not touching. We both start crying. It's... it's the first time I've cried in front of her in years.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we talk. Really talk, for the first time in months. About how we've been feeling, about the pressure I've been under at work, about her feelings of abandonment. It's... it's painful, but also... cathartic? Like lancing a wound.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved, I guess? But also... scared. Like we've crossed a line we can't uncross. I keep thinking about the look in her eyes when she was throwing those plates. The fear in my children's voices. I... I don't know how to move past this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70? My breathing is steadier.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens after your talk?",
    "Client: We... we decide we need help. Professional help. We're both ashamed, but we know we can't handle this on our own anymore. We make a pact to start therapy, both individually and as a couple. We... we hug each other, and it feels like the first real connection we've had in months.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: Scared, but... hopeful? It feels like admitting defeat, but also like taking control. I... I go to check on the kids. They're huddled together in my son's room. When I open the door, they look at me with such... such uncertainty. It breaks my heart.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I sit on the floor with them. I apologize for scaring them. I try to explain that Mommy and Daddy are going through a tough time, but that we love them and we're going to get help. My daughter... she crawls into my lap and hugs me. I start crying again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How does it feel to recall it?",
    "Client: It's... it's painful, but also... healing? Like I'm seeing it from a different perspective now. I remember feeling so lost that night, but now I can see it as a turning point.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 50? I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: I... I think that's good. It's exhausting to relive it, but I feel like I understand it better now. Like I can see how we got there, and how we started to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. We'll process this more in our next session. For now, what can you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll call Amira. Tell her I love her. Maybe take a walk in the park, clear my head a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed. I'm proud of the work you did today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward. It's still scary, but... but I feel more hopeful than I have in a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. We'll build on this progress next time. Take care, Mr. Aziz.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. See you next week."
