    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there in that hospital room, you know? The beeping of the machines, the antiseptic smell... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, wait... it's more like anxiety. Yeah, definitely anxiety. It's this overwhelming sense of helplessness, like I'm not in control of my own body. I keep thinking about how quickly everything changed, how one minute I was fine and the next... (voice trails off)",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's suffocating. Like I'm trapped in my own skin, you know? When I was lying there in that hospital bed, I couldn't move, couldn't breathe properly. The doctors were talking about me, not to me. I felt so small, so insignificant. And now, even though I know I'm okay, I can't shake that feeling. It's like my body remembers the fear, even if my mind knows I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're recalling this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up around my ears, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like my body's getting ready to fight or run, but there's nowhere to go. And my stomach... it's in knots. I feel slightly nauseous, just like I did when they were running all those tests.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not rational, but I can't help it. Every little ache or pain makes me panic. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're weak. You should be over this by now.\" It's exhausting, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings impact your daily life?",
    "Client: God, where do I start? I'm always tired because I can't sleep properly. I have nightmares about being back in the hospital. During the day, I'm distracted, jumpy. My work is suffering because I can't focus. And relationships? Forget about it. I've pushed everyone away because I don't want them to see me like this. It's like... it's like the illness took away more than just my health. It stole my confidence, my sense of security.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these memories now?",
    "Client: Well... (pauses) I guess I'm talking about it more easily than I used to. Before, I couldn't even think about the hospital without having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but I can at least put it into words. And I'm here, right? That's something. I'm facing it instead of running away. It doesn't feel great, but maybe... maybe that's progress?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that progress?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels a tiny bit proud, you know? Like, okay, I'm doing something difficult and I'm getting through it. But there's also this voice that says it's not enough, that I should be doing better. And then there's fear. What if I'm kidding myself? What if I never really get better? It's like I'm on this emotional rollercoaster, and I'm not sure when or if it's going to stop.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our remaining time today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to talk more about how to manage these intrusive thoughts. They're so persistent, you know? Even when I'm trying to focus on something else, they creep in. And once they start, it's like a snowball effect. Before I know it, I'm spiraling into panic again. Is there... are there techniques or something I can use to stop that from happening? Or at least to slow it down?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's explore some strategies for managing those thoughts.",
    "Client: That would be really helpful. I'm just... I'm so tired of feeling this way, you know? It's like I'm not even living my life anymore, I'm just reacting to these memories and fears. I want to feel like myself again. I want to be able to think about the future without this constant dread hanging over me. Is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: It is possible. How about we start with a grounding technique?",
    "Client: Okay, yeah. I'm willing to try anything at this point. It's funny, you know? Before all this happened, I never really thought about my mental health. Now it's all I can think about. I guess that's part of why this is so hard - it's not just the illness itself, it's how it's changed my whole perspective on life. Everything feels so fragile now. But I'm here, I'm trying. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. Shall we begin the grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm ready. Well, as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. It's strange, isn't it? How you can feel so desperate for help and so afraid of it at the same time. But I trust you, and I trust this process. Even if it's hard, even if it hurts sometimes, I know it's leading somewhere better. So yeah, let's do this. I want to learn how to live with this experience without letting it control me. I want to find a way to make peace with what happened and move forward.",
