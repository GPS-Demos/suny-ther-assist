    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. What exactly does that mean? It sounds a bit scary, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about having to relive that horrible experience. I've spent so much time trying to forget it. The idea of purposely thinking about it makes my heart race. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How have you been coping so far?",
    "Client: I've been trying to keep busy with my studies, but it's hard. Sometimes I have nightmares, and I've been avoiding certain places on campus. It's affecting my grades, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge. I haven't told my parents because I don't want them to worry.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Imaginal exposure can help address these symptoms. Shall I explain how?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to feel better, but I'm scared of making things worse.",
    "Therapist: It involves revisiting the memory in a safe environment. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense, but it still feels daunting. Will you be there the whole time? What if I panic?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe having a stress ball to squeeze? And knowing that I can open my eyes if it gets too intense? I'm just so afraid of feeling trapped again, like I did during... during the incident.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. We'll implement both. Any other questions?",
    "Client: How long will this take? Will I have to do this multiple times? I'm worried about how this might affect my studies and my ability to function day-to-day.",
    "Therapist: It varies, but typically several sessions. We'll monitor your progress closely. Anything else?",
    "Client: I guess I'm just wondering... is this really going to help? I mean, I know you're the expert, but it seems counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been trying so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: It's a common concern. Research shows this approach effectively reduces PTSD symptoms. Your courage is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I think I'm ready to try, even though I'm still nervous. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll be doing today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with relaxation exercises, then gradually approach the memory. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think so. I'm taking deep breaths like you taught me. It helps a little. I just hope I can get through this without falling apart. But I trust you, and I really want to get better. Let's do this."
