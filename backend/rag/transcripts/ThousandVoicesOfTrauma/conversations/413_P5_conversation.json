    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure what that means. Can you explain it a bit more? I'm feeling a bit nervous about what to expect.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll recount your traumatic experience in detail. It helps process the memory.",
    "Client: Oh, I see. That sounds pretty intense. I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about the animal attack in such detail. It still feels so vivid and scary. What if I get overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your understanding. I guess I'm worried about reliving those terrifying moments. The sound of the growling, the feeling of being cornered... it's all still so fresh in my mind. How will talking about it in detail help?",
    "Therapist: Facing the memory can reduce its power over you. It may be challenging, but it often leads to significant improvement.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, but it's still daunting. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it. The idea of purposely bringing it up is... well, it's scary. But if you think it will help, I'm willing to try. How exactly will we do this?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event as if it's happening now. I'll guide you through it, offering support.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I understand. So, I'll be talking about the attack as if it's happening in real-time? That's... wow. That's going to be tough. But I trust you. Can you tell me more about what I might experience during this process?",
    "Therapist: You may feel anxious or upset. This is normal. We'll work through these feelings together.",
    "Client: I appreciate your honesty. I'm definitely feeling a mix of emotions right now - fear, anticipation, but also a glimmer of hope. It's been so long since I've felt hopeful about overcoming this. How long will the exposure last? And what happens if it becomes too much for me?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 30 minutes. You can pause anytime if it's overwhelming. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds manageable. Knowing I can take a break if needed is comforting. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. Is there anything I should do to get ready for our next session when we'll actually do this?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your willingness to participate is enough. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I'm trying to be brave, even though it's scary. I'm grateful for your support through this. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Is there anything else I should know before we wrap up today?",
    "Therapist: Remember, this is a step towards healing. Your resilience is admirable. Any final questions?",
    "Client: I think you've covered everything. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared and understood. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I'll see you next session, ready to face this challenge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
