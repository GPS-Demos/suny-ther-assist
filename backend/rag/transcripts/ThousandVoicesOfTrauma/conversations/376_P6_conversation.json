    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day with the animal attack.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm there. It's hot, and I can hear the buzzing of insects. I'm on patrol with my unit, walking through a dense jungle area. The air feels heavy and humid.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: We're moving slowly, carefully. I'm sweating, my uniform sticking to my skin. Suddenly, I hear a low growl. My heart starts racing. I turn and see this massive wild boar, its tusks gleaming. It's charging right at us.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's jumped to a 7. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The boar is getting closer. I can see the fury in its eyes. I raise my rifle, but I'm shaking. I can't aim properly. It's all happening so fast. I hear someone yelling, but it's like everything is in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel tense all over, especially in my shoulders and jaw. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The boar reaches us. It knocks over Johnson first. There's so much chaos, people shouting, trying to get out of the way. I fire my rifle, but I miss. The boar turns towards me, and I freeze. I can smell its musty odor, see the saliva dripping from its mouth.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The boar charges at me. I try to jump aside, but I'm too slow. Its tusk catches my leg, and I feel this searing pain. I fall to the ground, and I'm sure this is it. I'm going to die here in this jungle.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. I'm thinking about my family, how I'll never see them again. I feel so helpless and angry at myself for freezing up.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My whole body feels tense, and I'm sweating a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's gunfire. Martinez managed to get a clear shot. The boar stumbles and falls just a few feet from me. I can smell the blood and gunpowder. I'm lying there, my leg throbbing, in shock.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to calm down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. The immediate danger is over, but I still feel shaky and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yeah... okay. The others are rushing over to me. Someone's putting pressure on my leg wound. I'm feeling dizzy, probably from the blood loss and adrenaline crash.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm relieved to be alive, but I'm also embarrassed. I feel like I let my team down by freezing up. And I'm worried about how bad my injury might be.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I'm still anxious, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (opens eyes, looks around) Wow, that was... intense. I didn't expect it to feel so real.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit shaken, but I'm glad I got through it. My SUDS is probably around a 4 again.",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well. Let's take a moment to process what you experienced."
