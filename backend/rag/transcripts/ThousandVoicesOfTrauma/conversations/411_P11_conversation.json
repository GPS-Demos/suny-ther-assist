    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's been years since I've allowed myself to revisit that day in such detail. The memory of being in that bank when those men came in with guns... it's still so vivid. I can still hear the screams, the sound of shattering glass... (takes a deep breath) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror I felt when one of the robbers grabbed a young woman and held a gun to her head. I remember thinking, \"This is it. We're all going to die.\" And then feeling so guilty for not doing anything to help her. I just... froze.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that moment today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt that same helplessness wash over me. But... there was something different this time. I felt more... in control, if that makes sense? Like I was observing it from a distance, even though the emotions were still strong.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How do you think this relates to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose it shows that I'm making progress, doesn't it? Before, I couldn't even think about that day without having a panic attack. Now, I can talk about it, even if it's still painful. It's like... the memory is losing some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've realized that... the guilt I've been carrying all these years, it's not entirely rational. I was just a bystander, caught in a terrible situation. There wasn't really anything I could have done without risking more lives.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Don't get me wrong, I still feel awful about what happened, but I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. I've been so angry with myself for so long, and maybe... maybe I can start to let that go.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's next for you in this process?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep facing these memories. It's hard, and sometimes I want to give up, but I can see now that it's helping. I want to get to a point where I can think about that day without it controlling my life. I want to be able to go to the bank without having a panic attack, or watch an action movie without reliving the trauma.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. How can we support that journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe we could work on some coping strategies for when the memories become too intense? And... I think I need to practice being kinder to myself. Is that something we can work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are excellent ideas. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. I've been thinking... maybe it would help to talk to other survivors? Not necessarily from the same incident, but people who've been through similar traumas. I feel so isolated sometimes, like no one can understand what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful suggestion. We can explore that.",
    "Client: Thank you. This is... it's hard, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling drained, but... in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done something difficult but important. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
