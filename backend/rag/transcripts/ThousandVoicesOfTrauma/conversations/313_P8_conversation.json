    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. My heart is racing, just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. I remember hiding in my closet, trying to make myself as small as possible. I was certain they were going to find me. My hands are actually trembling now, just thinking about it. It's silly, isn't it? I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to know that.",
    "Therapist: It's not silly at all. Your body is remembering. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?",
    "Client: Well, my mouth feels dry, and there's this tightness in my chest. I keep thinking about how vulnerable I felt. I've lived alone since Harold passed, and I never felt unsafe until that night. Now... now I'm always looking over my shoulder, always expecting the worst. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: How does this memory connect to your overall experience?",
    "Client: I suppose it's... it's made me lose faith in people. I used to think the world was generally good, you know? But after the break-in, I started seeing danger everywhere. That's partly why I moved to assisted living. I couldn't bear to be alone anymore. But even here, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, convinced I hear someone in my room.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" I've always tried to be a good person, to help others. I volunteered at the church for years, I was a good wife to Harold. It just doesn't seem fair. And then I feel guilty for thinking that because I know others have it worse. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm... I'm broken somehow. Like that night stole something from me that I can't get back.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. At the people who broke in, at myself for being so helpless, even at God for letting it happen. But mostly, I feel sad. Sad that I can't enjoy life like I used to. I used to love watching the sunset from my porch. Now, I'm too scared to sit outside alone when it gets dark. It's like... like I'm not living anymore, just existing.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you express these feelings?",
    "Client: Oh, my... I didn't even realize, but my fists are clenched. My jaw feels tight too. It's like all this tension is just... trapped in my body. But you know what's strange? Talking about it, really diving into these feelings... it's hard, but there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does this compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Well, at first, I couldn't even talk about that night without having a full-blown panic attack. I'd start shaking and crying, and sometimes I'd even feel like I couldn't breathe. Now, it's still difficult, but... I can actually put it into words. I can sit here and describe what happened without feeling like I'm right back in that closet. It's progress, I suppose, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: What does this progress mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means that maybe I'm not as broken as I thought. That maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. I've started to realize that what happened that night doesn't define me. It's a part of my story, sure, but it's not the whole story. I'm still the woman who raised three children, who loved her husband for 50 years, who makes a mean apple pie. I'm starting to see glimpses of that woman again, and it gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating. Like a weight has been lifted off my chest. Don't get me wrong, I still have bad days. Sometimes I still reach for a drink when the memories get too intense. But I'm learning to cope in healthier ways. I'm learning that it's okay to feel scared sometimes, but that I don't have to let that fear control my life. It's a process, but I think... I think I'm getting there.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to focus on moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on feeling safe again. Not just in my room here, but in the world. I want to be able to go for walks without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to be able to enjoy a sunset again without fear creeping in. I know it won't happen overnight, but that's what I want to work towards.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've done some hard work. Thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there.",
