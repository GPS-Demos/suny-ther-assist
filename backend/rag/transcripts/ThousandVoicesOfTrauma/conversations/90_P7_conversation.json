    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit nervous about today's session, to be honest. We're going to talk about that night again, aren't we?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we are. You're doing well by acknowledging your feelings.",
    "Client: (sighs) Okay. I'll try my best. It's just... it's hard to go back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Right. Okay. So... it was late, around 11 PM. I was watching TV in my living room. I remember feeling tired, thinking about heading to bed soon. Then I heard this... this loud crash from the kitchen. At first, I thought maybe I'd left a window open and something had fallen over. But then I heard footsteps. Heavy footsteps.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I froze. My heart started racing. I couldn't move. I could hear them moving around in the kitchen, opening drawers. Then I heard a man's voice say, \"Check the other rooms.\" That's when I realized there was more than one of them. I... I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I tried to get up, to run to the bedroom where I keep my phone, but my legs wouldn't work. I was shaking so badly. Then I saw a flashlight beam coming down the hallway. I... I couldn't breathe. I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The light hit me, and I heard one of them shout, \"We've got company!\" I remember raising my hands, pleading, \"Please, don't hurt me. Take whatever you want.\" My voice sounded so weak, so pathetic. I hated myself for being so scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared in that situation.",
    "Client: They... they came closer. There were two of them. Both wearing masks. One had a gun. He pointed it at me and said, \"Where's the safe, old man?\" I told them I didn't have one, but they didn't believe me. The one without the gun started tearing the place apart while the other one kept the gun on me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I kept thinking about my late wife. How she always wanted us to move to a gated community. How I'd insisted we were safe here. I felt so stupid, so guilty. What if she had been here? What if they had hurt her? I... I couldn't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: They kept asking about valuables, about cash. I told them where I kept some emergency money. The one without the gun went to get it. The one with the gun... he just stared at me. I could see his eyes through the mask. They looked... cold. Empty. I've never felt so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: When his partner came back, they started arguing. The one with the money wanted to leave, but the one with the gun... he wanted to \"teach me a lesson.\" I thought... I thought that was it. I closed my eyes, waiting for the shot. But then I heard sirens. They must have tripped an alarm or something. They ran, pushing me down as they went. I hit my head on the coffee table. Everything went black after that.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Scared. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I survived telling the story again. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's very normal. You did exceptionally well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. Can we take a short break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's pause here. You've made great progress."
