    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of the car accident feels so vivid now, like it just happened yesterday. I can still hear the screeching tires and smell the burning rubber. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most?",
    "Client: The moment of impact. I keep replaying it in my mind. The sound of metal crunching, glass shattering... and then the silence. That eerie silence right after. It's haunting.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying. My heart's still racing. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. And there's this guilt... this overwhelming guilt that I survived and my best friend didn't.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How does it compare to your daily experiences?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's similar. I've been having nightmares about the accident, and sometimes during the day, I'll hear a car horn or tires screeching, and I'm right back there. But this... this felt more intense. More real.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'm stronger than I thought. I managed to go through the whole memory without breaking down. That's... that's something, right? But I also realized how much I've been avoiding thinking about it. It's like I've been running from my own thoughts.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I need to stop running. Face it head-on. It's scary, but... but I can't keep living like this. The nightmares, the anxiety, the depression... it's affecting my marriage, my work. I need to find a way to process this and move on.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to talk about it more. With my wife, maybe even with a support group. And... and I want to visit my friend's grave. I've been avoiding that too. It's time I paid my respects properly.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: Scared. Really scared. But also... relieved? Like I'm finally doing something instead of just being paralyzed by fear and guilt. It's a small step, but it feels like the right direction.",
    "Therapist: It's a significant step. How can we support you?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll need help preparing for the grave visit. And maybe... maybe we could work on some coping strategies for when the memories hit? I want to be able to face them without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yeah... I... I want to thank you. This is hard, really hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. It's not clear yet, but... but there's hope. And that means everything right now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, John. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I'll be here. Thank you."
