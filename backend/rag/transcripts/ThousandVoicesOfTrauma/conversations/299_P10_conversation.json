    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: (sighs) To be honest, I'm a bit on edge. These sessions... they bring up a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that first day at the compound. What do you see?",
    "Client: (voice slightly shaky) I... I see the gates. They're tall, iron... imposing. There's a sign, but I can't quite make out the words. The air feels... heavy. Humid. It's like the atmosphere itself is pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: A man approaches. He's wearing all white, a big smile on his face. But his eyes... they're cold. He's saying something about \"new family\" and \"enlightenment.\" My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 40?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's leading me inside. There's... there's a group of people. They're all smiling, but it feels forced. Unnatural. I want to run, but my feet won't move. God, why didn't I just leave?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What do you notice about your surroundings?",
    "Client: (breathing quickens) It's... it's like a big hall. Concrete floors. The walls are covered in these bizarre paintings. Symbols I don't understand. And the smell... it's incense, but it's so strong it's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What's happening now?",
    "Client: They're... they're surrounding me. Touching me. Saying welcome, but it feels invasive. I can't breathe. I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mr. Johnson. Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's continue when you're ready. What happens after they surround you?",
    "Client: They... they start chanting. It's low at first, but it gets louder. I can't understand the words. Someone hands me a cup. The liquid inside is dark, murky. They're telling me to drink it, that it'll \"open my mind.\" I... I don't want to, but I feel like I have no choice.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Trapped. Scared. Like I'm losing control of everything.",
    "Therapist: That must be terrifying. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I drink it. It tastes bitter, metallic. Almost immediately, I feel dizzy. The room starts to spin. The chanting gets louder, more intense. I feel hands on me, guiding me somewhere. I want to resist, but my body won't respond.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening to your body?",
    "Client: My limbs feel heavy. My vision's blurry. I'm... I'm scared. What did they give me? Am I going to die? Oh God, I'm going to die here and no one will know.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's... it's at 80. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: They're... they're leading me to a room. It's dark, lit only by candles. There's a bed in the center. They're laying me down. I can't move. I can't speak. I'm... I'm helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I feel violated. They're touching me, but it's not sexual. It's like they're... examining me. Whispering things I can't understand. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Time... time becomes meaningless. I don't know how long I'm there. Hours? Days? The faces above me blur together. Sometimes they feed me, force water down my throat. Other times, more of that bitter liquid. I'm losing myself. Who am I? Why am I here?",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mr. Johnson. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I... I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: (after a pause) Okay... I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, the fog starts to clear. I'm able to sit up. My body feels weak, drained. They tell me I've been \"reborn.\" That I'm now part of their family. But I don't feel reborn. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's devastating. I feel like I've lost something I can never get back. My autonomy, my sense of self. They're all smiling at me, telling me how lucky I am. But I feel... hollow.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I smile back. I nod. I play along. Because I'm afraid of what will happen if I don't. But inside, there's this tiny spark. A part of me that's screaming, that knows this is wrong. And I cling to that spark like a lifeline.",
    "Therapist: That spark is your resilience. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It's... it's both comforting and painful. Comforting because it means I didn't completely lose myself. Painful because... because I know how much I'll have to endure before I can escape.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong, Mr. Johnson. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. Still high, but... I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Slowly open your eyes. Look around the room. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see your office. The plants in the corner. The clock on the wall. I'm... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Very good. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how these sessions feel. You did incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was... it was tough. But I think I needed it.",
    "Therapist: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
