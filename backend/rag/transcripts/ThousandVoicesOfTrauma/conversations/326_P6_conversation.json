    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the hostage situation.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm at work, in my office. It's a normal Tuesday morning. Suddenly, there's shouting in the hallway. I freeze, unsure what's happening. The door bursts open, and a man with a gun storms in. My heart starts racing, and I can't breathe. He's yelling at us to get on the ground. I'm shaking so much I can barely move.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweating, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's waving the gun around, threatening us. I can smell his sweat and hear my coworker crying next to me. Time seems to stretch forever. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll see them again. My mouth is so dry, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (Nods, voice shaky) The police arrive, and there's so much noise. Shouting, sirens. The gunman is getting more agitated. I'm terrified he'll start shooting. My whole body is trembling, and I can't stop the tears. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) The negotiation seems to last forever. Every minute feels like an hour. I keep thinking about my husband, my kids. The fear is suffocating. Finally, there's a commotion, and the police storm in. It's chaos. I'm being pulled up, rushed out. I can barely process what's happening.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: As we're escorted out, I see the gunman being arrested. I feel a rush of relief, but I'm still shaking. The bright sunlight outside is jarring. I'm disoriented, searching for familiar faces. When I finally see my husband in the crowd, I break down sobbing. The realization of what just happened hits me like a tidal wave.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",

    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My breathing is steadier now. I still feel a bit shaky, but the tightness in my chest is easing.",
    "Therapist: You did an amazing job, Sarah. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. That was intense, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. Your resilience is showing. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready to end the session now.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Remember to practice self-care. You've done great work today."
