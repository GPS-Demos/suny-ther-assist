    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. I can still see flashes of the hospital room, the beeping machines, the smell of disinfectant. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest sensation you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I can feel it in my chest, and my hands are shaky. It's like I'm back there, you know? I keep thinking about how alone I felt when they told me the diagnosis. I was only 19, and suddenly my whole world changed.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly frightening. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" I had so many plans, and then everything just... stopped. I remember feeling so angry at my body for betraying me. And now, even though I'm better physically, I can't shake this fear that it could all happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear affect you now?",
    "Client: It's like a constant weight on my shoulders. I find it hard to make plans or get excited about things. What's the point if it could all be taken away? And relationships... God, I can't even think about getting close to someone. What if I get sick again? Who would want to deal with that?",
    "Therapist: I hear how deeply this has impacted you. What else comes up?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. My parents were so supportive, but I could see the pain in their eyes every time they visited me in the hospital. They tried to hide it, but I knew. And now, even though I'm okay, I feel like I'm not living up to their expectations. They want me to move on, be happy, but I just... can't.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. How does talking about this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieving? I've never really told anyone all of this before. I've been trying so hard to act like everything's fine, to be the strong survivor everyone expects me to be. But inside, I'm still that terrified 19-year-old in the hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by sharing this. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to curl up and cry, but another part feels like I need to keep it together. It's exhausting, always feeling like I have to be strong. I wish I could just... let go, you know? But I'm scared of what might happen if I do.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to let yourself feel. What would letting go look like for you?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe allowing myself to be vulnerable? To admit that I'm not okay all the time. To tell my parents how I really feel instead of pretending everything's fine. Maybe even... maybe even trying to connect with people my age again. But the thought of doing any of that is terrifying.",
    "Therapist: What's the most frightening part about that for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the fear of being rejected. If I show people who I really am, all my fears and insecurities, what if they can't handle it? What if they leave? It's easier to just keep everyone at arm's length. But then I feel so lonely, and it's this awful cycle.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly isolating. How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: Mostly by throwing myself into my studies. It's the one area where I feel like I have some control. But even that's not enough sometimes. There are nights when the memories and fears are so overwhelming that I can barely breathe. I've thought about... about hurting myself, just to feel something different. I haven't done it, but the thought is there.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're sharing this. Have you ever talked to anyone about these thoughts before?",
    "Client: No, never. I've been so afraid of worrying everyone, of being a burden. But keeping it all inside is... it's killing me slowly. I don't want to feel this way anymore, but I don't know how to change it.",
    "Therapist: Your honesty is truly courageous. What do you think could be a first step towards change?",
    "Client: I... I guess maybe talking more openly about how I'm feeling? Not just here, but with my parents, maybe a close friend? And perhaps... perhaps looking into some support groups for young adults who've been through similar experiences? I've always avoided that because it felt like admitting weakness, but maybe it could help.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful ideas. How does considering those steps make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared, definitely. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I don't have to keep carrying all of this alone. It's a tiny feeling, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on how to start opening up to others. Maybe we could practice some conversations? And also, I'd like to explore more about why I feel so guilty for not being \"over it\" yet. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, to be honest. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. It's scary, but also... kind of freeing.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness today. We'll continue this journey together."
