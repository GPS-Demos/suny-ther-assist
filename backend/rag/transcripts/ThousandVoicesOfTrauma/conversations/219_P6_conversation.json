    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm angry and scared at the same time. Why is this happening to me?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. SUDS rating?",

    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I hear footsteps coming closer. My whole body tenses up. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible in the corner. The door handle starts to turn, and I...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Voice cracking) The door opens, and there's a man there. He's saying something, but I can't understand him. I'm frozen in fear. I want to run, but I can't move.",

    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Defeated. Hopeless. But also... there's a tiny part of me that's still fighting, still hoping for a chance to escape.",

    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As I walk out of the room, the light hurts my eyes. I see other people, some of them look as scared as I feel. We're being herded into a van. I'm trying to memorize everything I see, hoping it might help somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My heart is pounding, but I'm also feeling... I don't know, maybe a bit more in control as I try to take in my surroundings.",
    "Therapist: That's a good observation. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're in the van now. It's cramped and hot. I'm wedged between two other people. The van starts moving, and I have no idea where we're going. I'm trying to stay calm, but it's so hard.",
