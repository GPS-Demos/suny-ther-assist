    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the airplane crash. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm sitting in my seat, 14C. The plane is shaking violently. I can hear the engines making a strange noise, and people are starting to panic around me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The flight attendant looks scared. She's trying to stay calm, but I can see the fear in her eyes. The oxygen masks suddenly drop down, and there's a collective gasp from the passengers.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white. I'm terrified, thinking about my husband and children at home. I don't want to die.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The plane lurches downward, and I'm pushed back into my seat. People are screaming now. I'm trying to put on my oxygen mask, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely manage it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're strong enough to handle this.",
    "Client: Okay... The plane is losing altitude fast. I can see the ground coming up through the window. The man next to me is praying loudly. I close my eyes and brace for impact.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: There's a deafening crash. My body is thrown forward, but the seatbelt holds me back. I feel a sharp pain in my chest. Everything goes dark for a moment. When I open my eyes, the cabin is filled with smoke and debris.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My palms are sweaty, and my heart is pounding. It feels so real, like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I can smell fuel and something burning. People are moaning and crying out for help. I'm disoriented, but I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt. I need to get out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I stumble to my feet, coughing from the smoke. I can barely see, but I remember the flight attendant's instructions about the nearest exit. I start moving towards where I think it should be.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I trip over something... someone. I reach down and feel a hand. It's cold and limp. I recoil in horror, realizing it's a body. I want to help, but I can't. I need to save myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're doing what you need to survive.",
    "Client: I keep moving, feeling my way along the seats. The smoke is getting thicker, and it's harder to breathe. I'm panicking, thinking I might not make it out.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I see a faint light ahead. It's the emergency exit. Someone has managed to open it. I push forward, desperate to reach it.",
    "Therapist: You're almost there. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally reach the exit. The cold air hits me, and I can breathe again. I climb out onto the wing, my legs shaking. I see other survivors sliding down the inflatable slide. I follow them, stumbling onto the ground.",
    "Therapist: You made it out. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also guilty. So many people didn't make it. I'm alive, but I'm not okay. I can't stop shaking, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You've been through a lot.",
    "Client: I see emergency vehicles arriving. Paramedics are rushing towards us. Someone wraps a blanket around my shoulders, but I can't stop staring at the burning plane. I keep thinking about the people still inside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now, as you recall this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is still racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I can face this memory without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without having a panic attack. It's still hard, but it feels... manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel drained, but also... lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm nervous about our next session, but I also feel more prepared to face these memories now.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy attitude. We'll take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot to have someone guiding me through these difficult memories.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. I'll see you then."
