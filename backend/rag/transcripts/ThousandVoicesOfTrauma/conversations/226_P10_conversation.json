    "Therapist: Welcome, Mei. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. As ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at home. It's evening, and I'm scrolling through my social media feed. Everything seems normal at first, but then I notice a notification. Someone's tagged me in a post.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I click on it, and... oh god. It's a photo of me from a party last week. But it's been edited. They've... they've photoshopped my face onto a naked body. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. What do you do after seeing the photo?",
    "Client: I... I immediately try to report the post. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold my phone. I keep thinking, \"Who else has seen this? How long has it been up?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm sweating. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I start getting messages. Friends asking if I've seen it. Some are concerned, but others... others are making jokes. I feel so exposed, so violated.",
    "Therapist: That must be incredibly difficult. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Mei. Remember, this is just a memory. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I try to contact the person who posted it. They don't respond. I'm frantically messaging the platform's support, begging them to take it down. But it feels like it's spreading so fast. I see people sharing it, commenting on it. I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This is going to ruin my life. My business, my relationships... everything.\" I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. Who would do this to me?",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How are you coping in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I shut off my phone. I can't bear to look anymore. But even with the screen dark, I can't escape it. The image is burned into my mind. I curl up on my bed, sobbing. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. We're here together. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 90. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. Notice the chair supporting you. You're here, in this room, safe.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I eventually fall into a restless sleep. But when I wake up, it all comes rushing back. I'm terrified to check my phone. What if more people have seen it? What if it's gone viral?",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that fear?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to look. There are so many notifications. Some people defending me, others... others being cruel. I see comments about my body, my character. It's like I'm being torn apart in public.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly overwhelming. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I start reaching out to people I trust. My sister, my best friend. They're supportive, but I still feel so ashamed. Like somehow this is my fault.",
    "Therapist: Remember, this was not your fault. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My distress is... maybe 80? It's still high, but talking about it... it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mei. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. I barely eat or sleep. I'm constantly checking for updates, trying to get the image taken down. I feel like I'm fighting an invisible enemy. Every notification makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I cancel all my appointments. I can't face my clients. What if they've seen it? I feel like everyone is staring at me, judging me. Even going to the grocery store feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: That sounds isolating. What support do you have during this time?",
    "Client: My partner tries to help, but I push them away. I feel too dirty, too ashamed. My sister comes over, practically forces me to eat. But I can't shake this feeling of violation.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by sharing this. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. What happens as more time passes?",
    "Client: Slowly, the post starts to get taken down from different platforms. But the damage feels done. I'm paranoid about every interaction. I change all my privacy settings, but I still feel exposed.",
    "Therapist: How do you start to cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I finally agree to see a therapist. It's hard to open up at first, but it helps. I start to realize that this isn't my fault. That I'm the victim here.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does it affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's liberating, in a way. I start to feel angry instead of just ashamed. I decide to speak out about what happened to me. It's terrifying, but also empowering.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. Talking about how I started to fight back... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you see this experience affecting you now?",
    "Client: It's still hard. There are days when I feel like I can't trust anyone. But I'm also stronger. I've become an advocate against cyberbullying. It doesn't erase what happened, but it gives it some meaning.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. How are you feeling as we wrap up this session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also relieved. Talking about it like this... it's hard, but it's also healing.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Mei. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue to work through this together."
