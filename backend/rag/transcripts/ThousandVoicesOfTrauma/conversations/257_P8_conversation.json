    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel a bit shaky. The memories... they felt so vivid, like I was right back there in that room with the cult leader.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe more like... shame? It's this overwhelming sense of disgust with myself. I can't believe I let those things happen to me. I should have known better, should have fought harder.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're being quite hard on yourself.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's just... when I think about those moments, I feel so powerless. Like I was just a puppet, you know? They had complete control over me, my thoughts, my body. It makes me feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, and there's this tightness in my chest. My hands are clammy, and I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, like someone might be watching me. It's ridiculous, I know, but I can't shake this feeling of being exposed.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really intense. How are you managing those feelings?",
    "Client: I'm trying to breathe deeply, like we practiced. It helps a little, but then another wave of memories hits and... God, it's just so overwhelming. I keep hearing his voice in my head, telling me I'm special, chosen. But now I know it was all lies, all manipulation.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you about those lies?",
    "Client: I feel so stupid for believing them. I was lonely and vulnerable, and they took advantage of that. But part of me still wonders... what if they were right? What if I really am nothing without them? It's confusing because I know logically that's not true, but emotionally... I don't know.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have conflicting thoughts. How does that confusion affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me doubt everything. My decisions, my relationships, even my own thoughts. I'm constantly second-guessing myself, wondering if I'm making the right choices or if I'm just being manipulated again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit easier this time. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult, but I feel like I can breathe a little better. The first few times we did this, I felt like I was drowning in the memories. Now, it's more like... I'm treading water. Still struggling, but my head's above the surface, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to believe that it wasn't my fault. Like, really believe it, not just say it. And I'm remembering more of the good things in my life now, outside of the cult. My family, my studies... it's like I'm reconnecting with who I was before all this happened.",
    "Therapist: How does that reconnection feel?",
    "Client: Bittersweet, I guess. There's relief, definitely. Hope, even. But also sadness for the time I lost, the experiences I missed out on. And anger, too. I'm angry at them for taking so much from me, for twisting my perception of the world.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're processing a lot of complex emotions.",
    "Client: Yeah, it's like an emotional rollercoaster. One minute I feel strong and determined to move forward, the next I'm terrified and want to hide from the world. But... I think the good moments are lasting longer now. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I think it is. It's slow, and sometimes it feels like I'm taking two steps forward and one step back. But overall, I feel like I'm moving in the right direction. I'm starting to see a future for myself that isn't defined by what happened to me in the cult.",
    "Therapist: How does that vision of the future make you feel?",
    "Client: Excited, but also scared. It's like... I've been in this dark tunnel for so long, and now I can see a pinprick of light ahead. I want to run towards it, but I'm afraid it might disappear if I move too fast. Or that I'll trip and fall in the darkness before I reach it.",
    "Therapist: What helps you keep moving towards that light?",
    "Client: These sessions, for one. Talking about it, facing the memories... it's hard, but it makes me feel stronger. And my family, even though they don't fully understand, they're trying. Oh, and I started volunteering at an animal shelter. Being around the dogs, caring for them... it reminds me that I'm capable of giving and receiving love.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How does helping the animals impact your healing?",
    "Client: It's... grounding, I guess? When I'm with the dogs, I'm completely in the present. They don't care about my past or what happened to me. They just want love and care, and I can provide that. It makes me feel useful, valuable. And their unconditional affection... it's healing in a way I can't really explain.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're finding new sources of connection and meaning.",
    "Client: Yeah, I am. It's not always easy, and there are days when I struggle to get out of bed. But overall, I feel like I'm slowly reclaiming my life. The cult took so much from me, but they didn't take everything. I'm still here, still fighting. And for the first time in a long time, I actually believe I might win this fight.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge your strength?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, I guess? But also a little scary. Like, if I admit I'm strong, does that mean what happened to me wasn't as bad as I thought? Or that I should have been able to prevent it? I know that's not logical, but it's hard to shake those thoughts sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have those conflicting thoughts. What helps you challenge them?",
    "Client: Reminding myself of the facts, I suppose. The techniques we've practiced here. And honestly, talking to other survivors. Hearing their stories, seeing their strength... it helps me recognize my own. It's like, if I can see their resilience as strength, maybe I can see mine that way too.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. We're almost out of time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay, I think. Like I've run an emotional marathon. But also lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for miles. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we still have a long way to go, but I feel like I can face it now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Remember to be kind to yourself as you process everything. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try. See you next week."
