    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving the moment when I found out about my sister's cancer diagnosis... it's still so raw, you know? I can feel my heart racing, and my hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It's weird, but what I remember most is the deafening silence right after my parents told me. It was like the world stopped spinning for a moment. I could hear my own heartbeat, and then this overwhelming wave of... I don't know, despair? Fear? It all came crashing down.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to revisit that memory now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. I mean, I knew it would be hard, but I didn't expect to feel it so vividly again. My throat feels tight, just like it did that day. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, how I wanted to do something, anything, but there was nothing I could do to change the situation.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. How does this connect to your daily experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I realize now that I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that moment. Like, I can't watch medical dramas anymore, and I've been dodging calls from relatives who might ask about her. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for more bad news.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having trouble concentrating in class. My mind keeps wandering back to my sister, wondering how she's doing, if she's in pain. And I feel guilty for being at university while she's going through treatment. It's like I'm stuck between two worlds.",
    "Therapist: How do you think facing this memory might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it'll help me stop running from it? It's exhausting always trying to avoid thinking about it. And maybe... maybe if I can face this, I can be stronger for my sister. She needs me to be present, not constantly zoning out or avoiding her.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I need to talk to my sister more. Not just about her treatment, but about normal stuff too. And maybe I should join a support group for siblings of cancer patients. I've been putting it off, but I think it might help to talk to others who understand.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still shaky, but... maybe a bit lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. It's still there, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think I want to work on managing the anxiety I feel when I think about the future. Like, how do I balance being there for my sister with living my own life? It's something I struggle with daily.",
    "Therapist: That's a great topic. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This was tough, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to see how avoiding everything related to my sister's illness has been affecting me more than I realized. It's scary, but I feel like I'm finally facing it head-on.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. How will you take care of yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a long walk in the park near our house. It always helps clear my head. And maybe I'll call my sister tonight, just to chat about normal stuff. Nothing heavy, just... being present, you know?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. I'm proud of your work today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It means a lot to hear that. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might be able to handle this. It's still overwhelming, but... I don't feel as trapped by it anymore. Is that making sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready. It's not going to be easy, but I want to be able to support my sister without falling apart. And I want to be able to enjoy my life again without constant guilt. So yeah, I'm in. Let's keep going.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll pick up here next time. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
