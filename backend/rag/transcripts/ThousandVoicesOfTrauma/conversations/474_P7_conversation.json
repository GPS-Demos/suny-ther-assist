    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm closing my eyes. I'm feeling a bit nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm at the park... it's a sunny day. I can hear children playing in the distance. I'm walking my neighbor's dog, a golden retriever. He's so friendly and calm... I didn't expect... I didn't know...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear growling. There's a large dog, maybe a Rottweiler, approaching us aggressively. Its owner is far behind, shouting. My heart starts racing... I'm frozen...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The Rottweiler lunges at us. It's so fast... so vicious. I can't react quickly enough. It's attacking the golden retriever. There's so much noise - barking, growling, yelping. I'm screaming, but I feel like no sound is coming out.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: Blood... there's blood everywhere. The golden retriever is whimpering in pain. I'm trying to pull the Rottweiler away, but it's so strong. My hands are shaking. I can smell the metallic scent of blood. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: People are running towards us now. The Rottweiler's owner finally reaches us and manages to pull his dog away. But the damage is done. The golden retriever is lying there, barely moving. I'm on my knees beside him, my clothes covered in blood. I can't stop crying...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. Someone calls for help. I'm just sitting there, stroking the golden retriever's fur, telling him it'll be okay. But I don't know if it will be. I feel so guilty... I should have protected him better.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: The wait for help feels like forever. I can hear sirens in the distance. People around me are talking, but it's all a blur. I can't take my eyes off the injured dog. His breathing is shallow. I'm terrified he won't make it...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: When help arrives, they quickly take the dog away. I'm left sitting on the ground, covered in blood, feeling numb. The park that was so peaceful earlier now feels threatening. I can't stop shaking. I don't know how to face my neighbors... how to tell them what happened to their beloved pet.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I somehow make it home, but I can't shake off the images. The aggressive dog, the blood, the whimpers of pain. I have nightmares about it for weeks. Every time I see a dog now, I tense up. I feel like I've lost my sense of safety in a place I used to love...",
