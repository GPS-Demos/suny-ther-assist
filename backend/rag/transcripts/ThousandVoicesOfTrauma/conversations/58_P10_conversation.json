    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's dreading it. My divorce has been weighing on me heavily, and I know we need to address it, but... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to a significant moment during your divorce. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in our living room. It's evening, and the light is dim. Sarah is sitting across from me on the sofa. She's just told me she wants a divorce. I... I can feel my heart racing. My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: Sarah is talking, but I can barely hear her over the rushing in my ears. She's saying something about growing apart, but all I can focus on is the wedding photo on the mantelpiece. It feels like a mockery now. I... I want to yell, to make her understand how much this hurts, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. This feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally find my voice. I'm asking her why, begging her to reconsider. But she just shakes her head. She looks... sad, but determined. I can feel tears starting to form, and I'm fighting to hold them back. I don't want her to see me cry.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing great.",
    "Client: She starts talking about practical things - splitting assets, telling the kids. But I can't focus on that. All I can think about is how I've failed. Twenty-three years of marriage, and it's ending like this. I... I feel so small, so insignificant. Like I'm that bullied kid again, powerless and alone.",
    "Therapist: I hear how painful this is. Stay present with those feelings. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are hunched. I feel like I can't breathe properly. There's this... this heaviness in my stomach. And my head... it's pounding. I want to run, to escape, but I'm rooted to the spot.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. This is... it's so intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. Sarah is still talking, but her words are just noise now. All I can focus on is the crushing sense of failure. I've let everyone down - my kids, my parents, myself. I... I start to wonder if this is karma for all the times I couldn't stand up to my bullies. If I'm just destined to be a loser.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally break down. The tears come, and I can't stop them. I'm sobbing, and I hate myself for it. Sarah tries to comfort me, but I flinch away from her touch. It hurts too much. I can hear her crying too, but it doesn't make me feel any better. If anything, it makes it worse. We're both in pain, and I can't fix it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest hurts. It feels like I can't get enough air. The room seems to be spinning a bit.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. It's... it's helping a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Alright. Sarah is... she's getting up now. She says she'll stay with her sister for a few days, to give us both some space. I want to beg her to stay, but I can't find the words. I watch her pack a bag, feeling completely helpless. It's like I'm a spectator in my own life.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you watch her?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about all the times I should have been a better husband. All the little moments I took for granted. I'm angry at myself, at her, at the world. But mostly, I'm scared. I don't know how to be alone. I've always defined myself as Sarah's husband, as a family man. Without that... who am I?",
    "Therapist: These are powerful emotions. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. But it feels different now. Less panicky, more... hollow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sarah's at the door now. She turns to look at me one last time, and I can see the pain in her eyes. She says, \"I'm sorry, Amir. I really am.\" And then... she's gone. The door closes, and the sound echoes through the house. I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I don't do anything at first. I just sit there, staring at the closed door. Then, slowly, I get up. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. I walk to the kitchen, open the fridge, and grab a beer. I don't even like beer that much, but it feels like what I'm supposed to do. I sit at the kitchen table and just... exist.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like gravity has suddenly increased. My shoulders are slumped, my head is bowed. I feel... old. Tired. The beer tastes bitter, but I keep drinking it anyway.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how I'm going to tell the kids. How I'm going to face my parents, my friends. I'm wondering if I'll ever feel happy again. And... and I'm remembering all the times I was bullied in school. How I never stood up for myself. I'm wondering if that's why Sarah is leaving - because I'm weak, because I'm a pushover.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 7 now. The initial shock is wearing off, but the pain is still there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I finish the beer and consider having another, but I don't. Instead, I get up and wander through the house. Every room is full of memories, and it hurts to look at them. I end up in our bedroom - my bedroom now, I guess. I sit on the edge of the bed and look at Sarah's empty side. Her pillow still has an indentation from where she slept last night. I... I pick it up and hold it close. It smells like her shampoo, and that's what finally breaks me again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm crying again. But it's different this time. It's not the shocked, panicked tears from earlier. It's a deep, aching sob that seems to come from my very core. I cry until I'm exhausted, until there are no tears left. And then... I just lie there, still clutching her pillow.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Empty. Drained. Like I've cried out everything that made me who I am. I... I don't know what to do next. How to move forward from here.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 6 now. I feel wrung out, but... maybe a little calmer?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm breathing. It feels... it feels a bit easier now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Slowly open your eyes and look around the room. Tell me what you see.",
    "Client: I see... I see your office. The plants in the corner. The painting on the wall. My hands... they're shaking a little, but not as much as before.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now that we're back in the present?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's very common after an imaginal exposure. You did incredibly well today, Amir. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was... it was hard. Really hard. But I think... I think it might have been necessary. I've been avoiding thinking about that night for so long. Facing it... it hurts, but maybe it's the first step to moving forward?",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Remember, healing isn't linear. It's okay to have difficult days. Do you have any questions or concerns before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Just tired. Really tired.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Make sure to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll discuss this more in our next session. Well done, Amir."
