    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was during my time in prison. I was wrongfully convicted, you know. I remember the day they locked me up. The guard, he was so rough. He pushed me into the cell and slammed the door. The sound echoed through the whole block. I felt so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The cell was tiny, barely enough room to move. The walls were a dirty gray, and there was this awful smell. I sat on the thin mattress, and I could feel the metal springs digging into my back. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. I don't belong here.\" My heart was racing, and I couldn't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember looking at my hands, they were shaking. I could hear other inmates shouting, some were crying. The guard walked by and sneered at me. He said, \"Get used to it, grandma. This is your home now.\" I felt so... so humiliated. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... As night fell, the cell got darker. I couldn't sleep. Every sound made me jump. I kept thinking about my family, my home. I felt so alone, so scared. I started to cry, but I tried to be quiet. I didn't want anyone to hear me. I felt like I was losing myself, like everything I was had been stripped away.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is pounding. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I'll try. The next morning, they made us line up for breakfast. The other inmates stared at me. I could feel their eyes, judging me, wondering what an old woman like me was doing there. I couldn't eat. The food looked terrible, and my stomach was in knots. I kept thinking, \"How long will I have to endure this? Will I die here?\" It was the first time in my life I felt truly hopeless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I feel angry and sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. As the days went by, it didn't get easier. The guards were cruel, always yelling, always threatening. One day, during yard time, another inmate picked a fight with me. She was younger, stronger. I was so scared. I thought, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" But somehow, I found the strength to stand my ground. I didn't fight back, but I didn't cower either. The guards broke it up before anything happened, but that moment... it changed something in me.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible resilience. How do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: I... I feel proud, actually. I didn't know I had that strength in me. But it's still painful to remember. All those months, feeling like I wasn't human anymore. Like I was just a number, a statistic. It took so much from me.",
    "Therapist: You've come so far. How are you feeling about sharing this memory?",
    "Client: It's exhausting, but... I feel like a weight is lifting. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to forget it. It still hurts, but maybe... maybe it's a good kind of hurt? Like cleaning out an old wound.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. We'll stop here for today. You've done incredibly well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's still hard, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little freer?",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. We'll continue working through this. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I am. Thank you for helping me through this. I know it's not over, but I feel like I can face it now.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll pick this up next session."
