    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back there. It's dark, and I can smell incense. The room is crowded with other followers. Our leader, he's... he's walking towards me with that look in his eyes. I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 5... no, maybe a 6. My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: He's getting closer. I can see the anger in his face. He's shouting something about loyalty and sacrifice. I'm frozen, I can't move. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. It hurts. He's twisting it behind my back. I want to cry out, but I know that'll only make it worse. The other followers are just watching, no one's helping me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8? My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) He's pushing me to the ground now. I can feel the cold floor against my face. He's kicking me, over and over. I'm trying to curl up to protect myself, but it's not helping. The pain is... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My stomach is in knots. I can almost feel the bruises forming all over my body. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I can't handle this.",
    "Therapist: You're handling it right now. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The kicking stops, but now he's yelling at me. Calling me weak, unworthy. I want to get up and run, but I can't move. I'm in too much pain. I feel so helpless, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense. I'm sweating, and my heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 9. But... but I think it's not getting worse anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The other followers are leaving now. I'm alone with him. He's standing over me, telling me this is for my own good. That I need to learn obedience. I feel so small, so worthless. But there's also... anger. I'm angry that no one helped me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8? I'm still shaking, but my breathing is getting a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's stay with the memory a bit longer.",
    "Client: He's walking away now. I'm left there on the floor, hurting all over. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to get up, but everything hurts. I feel so alone, so betrayed.",
    "Therapist: And how are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sad. And angry. But the fear is starting to fade a bit. My heart isn't racing as much anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm still upset, but I'm starting to feel more... present, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll start winding down now. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm back in the room with you now. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually.",
