    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a lot to process. I feel drained, but also... kind of relieved? It's weird. Going through that memory of the cyberbullying incident was intense. I could feel my heart racing just like it did back then.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The shame, I think. Reliving how exposed and vulnerable I felt when those private messages were shared online... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could practically hear the notifications on my phone going off, one after another. Each one felt like a punch to the gut.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your day-to-day experiences now?",
    "Client: Well, I still get anxious around social media, but it's not as overwhelming as it was in that memory. I guess I've developed some coping strategies over time. But there's still that lingering fear that it could happen again.",
    "Therapist: I see. What strategies have helped you?",
    "Client: Um, I've learned to be more careful about what I share online. And I've gotten better at recognizing when I need to step away from my devices and take a breather. Oh, and I've been practicing those grounding techniques we talked about. They help when I start to feel panicky.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How did using those techniques feel during the exposure?",
    "Client: They... they actually helped more than I expected. When I started to feel overwhelmed, I focused on my breathing like we practiced. It didn't make the memory less painful, but it helped me stay present and get through it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized that... even though it was a horrible experience, I survived it. I'm still here, you know? And maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. It's just... it's hard to shake off that feeling of being powerless.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. How might this realization impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I can start challenging those negative thoughts more? Like, when I start to feel like I can't handle something, I can remind myself that I've gotten through tough situations before. It's just... it's still scary to put myself out there.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try reconnecting with an old friend online? Someone I trust. Just to dip my toes back in the water, so to speak. It's terrifying, but... I think I might be ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... kind of hopeful? I didn't expect to feel hopeful after reliving that memory. It's like... by facing it head-on, it lost some of its power over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful, but... maybe not as overwhelming as before?",
    "Therapist: That's often part of the process. Any other thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm just... I'm proud of myself for getting through it. A few months ago, I couldn't even think about that incident without having a panic attack. And now... well, it's still hard, but I did it. I actually did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on some strategies for managing anxiety when I do start interacting more online? And... maybe we could explore how this connects to some of my childhood experiences? I'm starting to see some patterns that I hadn't noticed before.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick that up next session. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath, maybe do some journaling. And I promised myself a treat if I got through today's session, so... ice cream is definitely happening. Oh, and I'll make sure to use those relaxation techniques before bed. I know I might have some nightmares tonight, but I feel more prepared to handle them now.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Remember, you've made real progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know we still have a long way to go, but... for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get through this. It's scary, but... also kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll build on this next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. And... thank you. For helping me through this. I couldn't have done it alone.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
