    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... honestly, I'm quite nervous. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that medical trauma, especially with everything else going on in my life... it's overwhelming. My anxiety has been through the roof lately, and I'm not sure I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Am I really, though? It doesn't feel like it. Every time I think about what happened in that hospital, I feel like I'm right back there, helpless and scared. And with all the recent news about human trafficking... it just adds another layer of fear and uncertainty to everything.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This exercise aims to help you process those emotions safely.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... how exactly is this supposed to help? Won't reliving it just make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Good question. Exposure helps reduce trauma's power over time. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this. It's hard enough dealing with my everyday anxiety, let alone deliberately bringing up these traumatic memories.",
    "Therapist: The idea is to face the memory in a safe environment, gradually lessening its impact.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart during the session?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you. It's just... being a professional, a husband, and dealing with all this... it's a lot. Sometimes I wonder if I'm strong enough to get through it all.",
    "Therapist: Your strength in being here shows resilience. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. Can you tell me what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. You'll recount the traumatic event while I guide you. Emotions may intensify initially.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will it get easier over time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, typically. With each session, many find the memory becomes less overwhelming.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm still nervous, but I'm willing to try. Is there anything I should do to prepare?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Remember, you can pause anytime if needed.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess... I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm scared, but I'm also hopeful that this might finally help me move forward. Thank you for being here with me through this."
