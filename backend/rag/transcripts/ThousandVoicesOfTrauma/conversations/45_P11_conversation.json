    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Reliving that moment of imprisonment, it brought back so many memories of the neglect I experienced. I could almost feel the cold walls closing in on me again.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most?",
    "Client: The loneliness. It was crushing. I remembered how I used to curl up in the corner of my cell, trying to make myself as small as possible. I felt so abandoned, just like when I was a child. It's like... like the world had forgotten I existed.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I still struggle with feeling invisible sometimes. Even in my marriage, I find myself withdrawing, afraid to take up space. It's like I'm back in that cell, trying to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What helped you cope then?",
    "Client: I... I used to imagine my future. A life beyond those walls. It was hard, but sometimes I'd picture myself free, walking on a beach, feeling the sun on my face. It gave me hope.",
    "Therapist: How might that strategy help now?",
    "Client: I hadn't thought about that. Maybe... maybe I could use that when my anxiety spikes? Picturing a positive future instead of getting lost in my fears?",
    "Therapist: Sounds promising. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I also remember... There was this small window in my cell. Sometimes, I'd see a bird fly by. It reminded me that there was a whole world out there. I think... maybe I need to remind myself of that more often now. That my world is bigger than my fears.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful? Like maybe I'm not as trapped as I sometimes feel. But it's also scary. What if I can't break free from these feelings?",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I suppose... I could try to be more present with my partner. Maybe share some of what I'm going through instead of withdrawing. It's terrifying, but... maybe it could help?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I think I understand myself a bit better now. I can see how my past is still affecting me, but maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... yes. Yes, I think it is. It's small, but it feels like a step forward. I'm exhausted, but there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a tiny piece of the burden I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: That I'm not alone anymore. That these memories don't have to control me. And that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to take up space in my own life again. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to keep trying."
