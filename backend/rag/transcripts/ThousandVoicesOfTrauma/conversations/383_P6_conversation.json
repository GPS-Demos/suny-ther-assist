    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm back in my childhood home. I can smell the musty odor of the basement. My heart is starting to race a bit as I hear heavy footsteps coming down the stairs.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I see my uncle's face. He looks angry. I'm frozen in place, unable to move. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's yelling at me, but I can't make out the words. Everything feels muffled, like I'm underwater. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I'm shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens outside. There's a loud banging on the front door upstairs. My uncle looks panicked. He grabs my arm roughly and tells me to be quiet.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The police are in the house now. I can hear shouting and things breaking. My uncle is trying to drag me towards a back window. I'm terrified of what he might do.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... conflicted. Part of me is relieved that someone's here, but I'm also scared of what might happen. The police sound so aggressive.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex mix of emotions. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a crash, and police officers burst into the basement. Everything happens so fast. They're yelling, pointing guns. My uncle lets go of me and puts his hands up. I collapse to the floor, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. Relieved but also traumatized. The police were so rough, even with me. They didn't seem to care that I was just a kid.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone down a bit, maybe a 6 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've been through a lot.",
    "Client: Yeah, I have. I remember being taken to the police station. The officers were cold, asking me questions I didn't want to answer. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling this make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's bringing up a lot of anger. Anger at my uncle, but also at the police. They were supposed to help, but they just made me feel worse.",
    "Therapist: Your anger is valid. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7. I'm feeling tense all over.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm trying to remind myself of that. It's just... the memory feels so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, feel the rough handling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you describe what you're feeling physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tight, especially in my shoulders and jaw. My stomach feels knotted, and I have a headache forming. I'm also feeling a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Those are common reactions. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's starting to come down a bit, maybe a 5 or 6. I'm feeling exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after such an intense experience. You did great today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped to talk about it. I've never really shared those details before.",
    "Therapist: You showed a lot of courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. My SUDS is down to a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here for today."
