    "Therapist: Welcome, Malia. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the bullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the university cafeteria. It's loud, and I can smell the food. I'm sitting alone, trying to eat my lunch. A group of students walks by, and I hear one of them say, \"Look at the island girl. Does she even understand what we're saying?\" They laugh, and I feel my face getting hot. My stomach churns, and I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: They keep walking, but I can still hear them laughing. I'm trying to focus on my food, but my hands are shaking. I feel so alone and out of place. I want to stand up for myself, but I'm afraid they'll make fun of my accent. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and I feel a lump in my throat. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I decide to leave. As I stand up, I accidentally knock over my water bottle. It spills all over the floor, and everyone turns to look at me. I hear more laughter, and someone shouts, \"Go back to your island!\" I'm frozen, humiliated. Tears are welling up in my eyes, and I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel so overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I finally manage to move. I'm rushing out of the cafeteria, leaving my belongings behind. I can hear people whispering and giggling. I run to the bathroom and lock myself in a stall. I'm crying, trying to muffle the sound. I feel so alone, so different. Why can't I fit in? Why do they hate me?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Malia. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My hands are clammy, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I stay in the bathroom for what feels like hours. I miss my next class. I'm too embarrassed to go back to the cafeteria for my things. I keep replaying their words in my head, hearing their laughter. I feel so small, so worthless. I wish I could disappear or go back home where I belong.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally leave the bathroom when I think everyone's gone. The cafeteria is empty, and my things are still there. As I gather them, a janitor asks if I'm okay. It's the first kind word I've heard all day, and I start crying again. He looks concerned but doesn't know what to do. I thank him and hurry out, feeling a mix of gratitude and shame.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little better. My SUDS is probably around a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved to have talked about it?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's end the exercise here. You did very well, Malia.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. I've never really talked about this before.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. We'll process this more next time. For now, let's do some grounding exercises."
