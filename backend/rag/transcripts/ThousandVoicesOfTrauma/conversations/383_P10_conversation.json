    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My heart's already racing a bit. But I know this is important, so I'm trying to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the street. It's crowded, noisy. I'm walking home from the market, carrying groceries. The sun is setting, casting long shadows. I can smell spices from the nearby restaurants.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. People are running. I see... I see police officers charging down the street, batons raised. My heart starts pounding. I... I freeze.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. My mouth goes dry, and I can't move. I'm... I'm transported back to when I was a child, helpless... Oh god...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. The officers are getting closer. People are screaming. I see a young man fall, an officer striking him. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathing slowly* Right. Safe. I'm... I'm still on the street. An officer looks at me. His eyes are... cold. Empty. He raises his baton. I flinch, dropping my groceries. Oranges roll across the pavement.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he pushes past me. I stumble, fall to my knees. The concrete scrapes my palms. I can smell my own sweat, hear my heart pounding in my ears. People are still screaming, running.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are shaking. My chest feels tight. I feel so... so helpless. Just like when I was a kid and my uncle would...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay in the present memory. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to stand. My legs feel weak. I see a woman crying, her arm bleeding. I want to help her, but I'm too afraid. I hate myself for it.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel afraid in that situation. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The sound of sirens. More police cars arriving. The air feels thick, hard to breathe. I see a young boy, maybe 10 years old, looking terrified. He reminds me of... of myself.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. I feel like I'm there again, helpless, scared.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now, safe in this room. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm... I'm still on the street. The boy is crying now. I... I make a decision. I walk towards him, my heart pounding. I reach out my hand.",
    "Therapist: That's brave. What happens?",
    "Client: He... he takes my hand. I pull him close, shielding him with my body. We start moving away from the chaos. I can feel him trembling against me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to protect him?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering. Scary, but... right. Like I'm finally doing something instead of just being frozen.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Continue with what you see and feel.",
    "Client: We're moving through the crowd. I can smell tear gas now. My eyes are stinging. The boy is coughing. I... I pick him up, carry him. He clings to me tightly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your anxiety level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high, but maybe a 7 now. I'm focused on getting the boy to safety.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We turn down a side street. It's quieter here. I can still hear the chaos behind us, but it's muffled. I set the boy down, ask if he's okay. He nods, tears in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Relieved, but still shaken. My hands are trembling. I... I realize I'm crying too. The boy hugs me suddenly, and I... I break down.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I hold him for a moment, then we hear voices. His parents, calling his name. They rush over, embracing him. They thank me, but I can barely speak.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel a mix of relief and shame. Relief that the boy is safe, but shame that I couldn't do more. That I was so afraid.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I watch the family leave, then slowly make my way home. My legs feel like lead. Every siren makes me jump. I... I feel hollow, drained.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in your body?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My muscles are tense. I feel a headache coming on. But... but also a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I helped that boy?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive reflection. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to maybe a 6. I'm still anxious, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's continue. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I lock the door behind me. My wife is there, worried sick. She hugs me tightly, and I... I just start sobbing. All the fear, the tension, it just comes pouring out.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to let it out?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief. But also painful. Like I'm reliving it all over again. But my wife, she... she just holds me, lets me cry.",
    "Therapist: That support is important. What do you do after?",
    "Client: I... I take a long, hot shower. Try to wash away the day. But I can still hear the screams, see that officer's cold eyes. I... I don't sleep well that night.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have trouble sleeping after a traumatic event. How do you cope?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on the boy I helped. It helps a little. But I still feel... I don't know, guilty? Like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Remember, you did what you could in a difficult situation.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's hard. The next few days, I'm jumpy, irritable. I snap at my wife, my kids. I feel terrible about it.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to talk to my wife about it. It's hard at first, but... it helps. She listens, doesn't judge. I start to feel a little less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Communication is crucial. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Talking about this is exhausting. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy weight, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4, I think. I'm still anxious, but... it feels more manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* Okay... I'm... I'm back in the room with you. It feels... it feels good to have talked about this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something I've been afraid of for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Well done. Let's end here for today."
