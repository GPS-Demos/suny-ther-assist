    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. The idea of revisiting that animal attack makes my stomach churn. It's been years, but sometimes I still wake up in cold sweats thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it? I've worked so hard to keep these memories at bay, and now we're intentionally bringing them up. It feels counterintuitive and, frankly, a bit scary.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe facing it could help me process it better? But I'm still uncertain. My depression has been manageable lately, and I'm worried this might trigger a downward spiral. Plus, as a non-binary person, I sometimes feel like my experiences aren't fully understood or validated. Will this exercise take that into account?",
    "Therapist: Your identity is respected here. This is about your unique experience. Shall I explain the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing what to expect might help ease some of my anxiety. And... I appreciate you acknowledging my identity. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You're in control. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I think so. Go on.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in present tense. I'll guide you. We'll start and stop as needed. Okay?",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. But I think I can manage. Will you be there to support me if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I'm wondering about aftercare. After we do this, how do I take care of myself? I live in shared accommodation, and I'm self-employed, so I have some flexibility, but I'm concerned about being emotionally raw around others.",
    "Therapist: Great question. Let's discuss coping strategies and a post-session plan. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. Given my history of sexual abuse, I'm worried that revisiting this trauma might bring up those memories too. How do we handle that if it happens?",
    "Therapist: That's an important consideration. We'll focus on the specific event, but acknowledge connections if they arise. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That makes sense. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I think... I think I'm ready to try this. It's scary, but if it can help me move forward, I want to give it a shot. I've been stuck for so long, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I trust you to guide me through this. And thank you... for creating a space where I feel seen and heard. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start. Close your eyes when you're ready."
