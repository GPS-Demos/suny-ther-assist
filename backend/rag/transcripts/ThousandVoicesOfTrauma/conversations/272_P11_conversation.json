    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel... I don't know, kind of shaky? But also relieved in a way. It's strange to revisit those memories of the cult, especially the initiation ceremony. I can still see the dimly lit room, smell the incense...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. I was so young, only 8 years old, and I remember feeling terrified but also... special? Like I was being chosen for something important. It's confusing to reconcile those conflicting emotions even now.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was intense. I felt like I was right back there, hearing the chanting, feeling the scratchy robe they put on me. But this time, I could also feel my adult self watching, if that makes sense? It was like I could see how manipulated and vulnerable I was as a child. It made me angry, actually.",
    "Therapist: Anger is a natural response. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I think... well, I've always struggled with trusting people, especially authority figures. Now I can see why. And my anxiety - it's like I'm always waiting for something bad to happen, just like I was back then. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. What else?",
    "Client: I've never felt like I fit in anywhere, you know? Always on the outside, even in my professional life. I think it stems from feeling so different after leaving the cult. Like I had this secret that set me apart from everyone else.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing this impact you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Understanding where these feelings come from helps me see that they're not just a part of who I am. They're a result of what happened to me. Maybe I can work on changing them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep exploring this. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. And maybe... maybe I can start to let go of some of the shame I've been carrying all these years. It wasn't my fault. I was just a child.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing incredible strength. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I think I need to practice being more open with people, maybe starting with my husband. He knows about my past, but I've never really shared the details or how it affects me. It's scary, but I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great step. How do you feel about continuing our work?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but committed. This is the first time I've felt like I might actually be able to move past this. It's hard work, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What else is on your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the other children in the cult. I wonder if they're okay, if they got out. Part of me wants to reach out, but another part is terrified of opening that door. Is that something we could explore in future sessions?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that when you're ready. For now?",
    "Client: For now, I think I need to rest. This session was emotionally draining, but in a good way. I feel like I've climbed a mountain and can finally see the view. It's overwhelming, but also... hopeful? Yeah, I think that's the word. Hopeful.",
