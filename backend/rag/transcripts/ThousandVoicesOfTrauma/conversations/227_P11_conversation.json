    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, you know? Reliving that moment when I saw my father hit my mother... it's bringing up so many emotions. I feel drained, angry, and sad all at once. It's like I'm right back there, feeling helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. The sound of his hand hitting her face. It's so vivid, even now. I can hear it echoing in my head. And my mother's cry... it was so... broken. I've never forgotten that sound. It's haunted me for years.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. I felt like a scared little boy again. My heart was racing, and I could feel my hands shaking. But... there was something different this time. I felt... I don't know... maybe a little stronger? Like I could look at it without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I'm not that helpless child anymore. I'm a grown man now. I have my own life, my own family. I've made something of myself despite everything. It still hurts, but I'm starting to see that I'm not defined by what happened back then.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I think... I think a lot of my anger issues and the drinking... it all stems from this feeling of powerlessness. When I get stressed or feel out of control, I lash out or turn to alcohol. It's like I'm trying to regain that power I never had as a child.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's eye-opening, honestly. I've never really put it together like that before. It makes me wonder how much of my life has been shaped by this one moment. But it also gives me hope. If I can understand it, maybe I can change it.",
    "Therapist: What strategies might help you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe learning to recognize when I'm feeling powerless and finding healthier ways to cope. Maybe talking to my wife instead of bottling things up. And... I know it's hard, but cutting back on the drinking. It's not really helping, is it?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I need to do this. For myself, for my family. I don't want to be controlled by this anymore. It's been too long, you know? I want to be free from it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe, just maybe, I can actually heal from this. It won't be easy, but I'm starting to believe it's possible. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can we build on this next time?",
    "Client: I'd like to... maybe explore more of these connections we've made. And perhaps work on some of those coping strategies we talked about. I want to be better prepared for when these feelings come up outside of our sessions.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll focus on that next week. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. It's terrifying and exciting all at once. But I'm ready to keep going."
