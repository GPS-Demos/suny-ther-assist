    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you start describing the experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a warm summer evening. I was at a friend's house for what I thought was just a small gathering. When I arrived, there were more people than I expected. The atmosphere felt... off somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: There were candles everywhere, and this strange, sweet smell in the air. People were dressed in robes, which I thought was weird. My friend, Sarah, approached me with this eerie smile and said, \"We've been waiting for you.\" I felt a chill run down my spine.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can do this. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel anxious. Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... Sarah led me to a room in the back. There were more people there, sitting in a circle. They all turned to look at me when I entered. I felt so exposed, like they could see right through me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the center of the circle was a man. He looked older, maybe in his 50s. He had this intense gaze that made me feel... I don't know, both drawn in and terrified at the same time. He stood up and walked towards me, saying, \"Welcome, child. We've been expecting you.\"",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. Really scared. But also... curious? I know that sounds messed up, but there was a part of me that wanted to know more. Is that wrong?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong way to feel. You're processing a complex experience.",
    "Client: The man, who I later learned was called \"The Prophet,\" took my hand. His touch felt... invasive. He led me to the center of the circle and told everyone, \"Our newest member has arrived.\" That's when I realized I was trapped. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: They started chanting something I couldn't understand. The Prophet placed his hands on my head, and I felt this surge of... I don't know, energy? Fear? It was overwhelming. I closed my eyes, wishing I could disappear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: When I opened my eyes, everyone was staring at me with these expectant looks. The Prophet said, \"You've been chosen.\" That's when... that's when the abuse started. I can't... I don't want to go into details. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You don't have to share more than you're comfortable with. You've done really well.",
    "Client: I feel sick thinking about it. How could I have let this happen? Why didn't I run away?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You were in a difficult situation.",
    "Client: But I kept going back. For weeks. I knew it was wrong, but I felt like I belonged somewhere for the first time. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: It's a common response. You're not crazy.",
    "Client: I finally broke away when they wanted me to recruit others. That's when I realized how deep I was in. I just... I can't believe I fell for it all.",
    "Therapist: You showed strength by leaving. That's important to recognize.",
    "Client: I guess... But I still have nightmares. I see their faces, hear their voices. Sometimes I wake up feeling like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal after trauma. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: Will I ever feel normal again? Sometimes I feel like I'm permanently broken.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time, but you're making progress. You're not broken.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. It's just... hard to believe sometimes. Especially when I'm alone with my thoughts.",
    "Therapist: That's why we're here. To work through those thoughts together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a break now. This was a lot.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. Let's take some deep breaths before we end."
