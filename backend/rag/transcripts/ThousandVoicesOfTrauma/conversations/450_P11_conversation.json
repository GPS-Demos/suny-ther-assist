    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always hard to go back to those memories, you know? I can still feel the tightness in my chest, like I'm right back there in that moment. It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: Well, I... I noticed more details about the room this time. The peeling wallpaper, the smell of cigarettes. It's funny how those little things can bring it all rushing back. And I realized how small I felt, how powerless. I was just a child, but I felt like I should have been able to do something, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It made me feel... angry. Angry at myself for being so helpless, and angry at the adults who should have protected me. But then I also felt this wave of sadness for that little girl I was. It's like I'm grieving for her all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Maria. How does this connect to your experiences now?",
    "Client: I guess... I still struggle with feeling powerless sometimes, especially when I face discrimination at work or in my community. It's like I'm that little girl again, unable to speak up or defend myself. And then I turn to alcohol to numb those feelings, which only makes things worse.",
    "Therapist: I see. How might understanding this connection help you moving forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I need to work on recognizing when I'm feeling that way and find healthier ways to cope. I don't want to keep reliving that powerlessness or numbing myself with alcohol. I want to feel strong and in control of my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. What's one step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try to speak up more when I face discrimination. Instead of shrinking away, I could assert myself. It's scary to think about, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave step, Maria. How can we support you in that?",
    "Client: Well, maybe we could practice some scenarios? Like, role-play situations where I might face discrimination and work on how I could respond. And... I think I need to work more on managing my anxiety in those moments without turning to alcohol.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How are you feeling about your progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard work, and sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back. But I'm proud of myself for sticking with it. I can see small changes, you know? Like, I'm more aware of my triggers now, and I'm starting to catch myself before I spiral into those old patterns.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Maria. What's keeping you motivated?",
    "Client: I guess... I want to break this cycle, not just for me but for my kids too. I don't want them to inherit my trauma or my struggles with alcohol. And I'm starting to believe that maybe I deserve better, you know? That little girl deserved better, and so do I.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful, Maria. How can we build on this in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to dive deeper into those moments when I feel powerless now. Maybe we can explore some specific incidents and how they connect to my past trauma. And I want to work more on coping strategies that don't involve alcohol. It's scary to think about facing all those feelings without it, but I know it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think that covers it. I'm feeling drained, but also kind of... hopeful? Like maybe I'm finally starting to understand myself better. It's exhausting work, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: Your hard work is commendable, Maria. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Rodriguez. I appreciate your support through all of this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for my struggles. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Maria. Remember to use your coping strategies if needed."
