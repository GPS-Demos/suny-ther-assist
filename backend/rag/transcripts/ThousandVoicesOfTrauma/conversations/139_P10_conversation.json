    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around 60? Yeah, 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my room. It's late, maybe 11 PM. I'm on my laptop, scrolling through social media. The room is dark except for the glow of the screen. I can hear my parents watching TV downstairs.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I get a notification. It's a message from someone I don't know. I open it and... oh god. It's a photo of me. A private photo. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm panicking. My hands are shaking as I try to type a response. \"Who are you? Where did you get this?\" But they don't answer. Instead, they send another message: \"Send more or this goes public.\"",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I can't breathe. I feel like I'm going to throw up. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared and ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Remember your grounding technique. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. My feet are on the carpet. It's soft.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I decide to block them. But then I get messages from other accounts. The same threat. Over and over. It's like they're everywhere. I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's high. Really high. Like 90.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I start crying. I feel so helpless. I don't want anyone to see those photos. I'm thinking about my family, my friends at school. What if they see them? I'd die of embarrassment.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right... right. I know. But it feels so real. I remember closing my laptop and curling up in bed, sobbing. I couldn't sleep all night.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are up to my ears. My stomach hurts. I feel cold and shaky.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. What happens the next day?",
    "Client: I go to school, but I can barely focus. I keep checking my phone, terrified of more messages. Every time someone looks at their phone, I think they've seen the photos.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: At lunch, I overhear some kids laughing and looking at their phones. I'm convinced it's about me. I run to the bathroom and lock myself in a stall. I'm hyperventilating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. I'm so scared and alone. I want to disappear. I'm thinking about... about hurting myself.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah. I know. But it's hard. I stayed in that bathroom for the rest of the day. I couldn't face anyone.",
    "Therapist: What happened when you got home?",
    "Client: I... I finally told my mom. I was so ashamed, but I couldn't handle it anymore. She was upset, but she hugged me and said we'd figure it out together.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to remember that moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit of relief. Like a tiny weight lifted off my chest. But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 70? It's coming down slowly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Let's continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: We reported it to the school and the police. It was embarrassing, having to show them the messages. But they were kind. They said it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: A little better, I guess. But I was still paranoid. I kept thinking everyone knew, that they were judging me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The next few weeks were hell. I couldn't concentrate in class. I stopped hanging out with friends. I was always looking over my shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually coming down more. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started seeing a counselor at school. She helped me deal with the anxiety. Slowly, I started to feel a bit more normal. But I still had nightmares.",
    "Therapist: Can you describe one of those nightmares?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing in the school hallway. Everyone has their phones out, laughing. Those photos are everywhere. I'm naked, exposed. I try to run, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, it's just a memory now.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah. I know. It's getting easier to talk about, but it still hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 50 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about what happened now?",
    "Client: I'm still angry. And scared sometimes. But I'm also... I don't know, stronger maybe? I survived it. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I learned who my real friends were. The ones who stuck by me, who didn't judge. And my family... they were amazing. It brought us closer in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outcome. How else has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: I'm more cautious online now. But I'm also more empathetic. When I hear about others going through similar things, I understand. I want to help.",
    "Therapist: That's a very mature perspective. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... wow, it's down to about 40. I didn't expect that.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress today, James. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. It still hurts, but it doesn't control me like it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant breakthrough. We'll end our session here. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this like this. It's still hard, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll continue working on this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
