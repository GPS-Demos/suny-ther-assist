    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that day in the hospital, it's so vivid now. I can still smell the antiseptic, hear the beeping machines. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Lying there on that hospital bed, not knowing if I was going to make it. And then... then I think about work. How I pushed myself so hard, ignored all the warning signs. I feel angry at myself, you know? Like, how could I let it get so bad?",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a hot knot in my stomach. I was so focused on climbing the corporate ladder, impressing my bosses, that I completely neglected my health. And for what? A job that doesn't even care if I live or die? I feel like such an idiot. And now, even though I'm better physically, I can't shake this fear. Every time I feel a twinge in my chest at work, I panic. I'm constantly worried it's going to happen again.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear affect you day-to-day?",
    "Client: It's paralyzing sometimes. I find myself avoiding certain tasks at work, anything that might stress me out too much. I've turned down projects, opportunities that could have been great for my career. And the anxiety... it's constant. I'm always on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's exhausting, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you notice in your body when you talk about this?",
    "Client: I... wow, I didn't even realize, but my hands are clenched. My shoulders are so tense they're practically up to my ears. And there's this knot in my throat, like I'm trying not to cry. It's funny, I thought I was over this, but talking about it... it's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to allow yourself to feel these emotions?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also kind of a relief? Like, I've been holding this all in for so long, trying to act like everything's fine. But it's not fine. I'm not fine. And admitting that... it's terrifying, but it also feels like... like I can finally breathe a little, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience with the trauma?",
    "Client: I think... I think I've been running from it. Trying to pretend it never happened, that I'm the same person I was before. But I'm not. That experience changed me. And maybe... maybe that's okay? Maybe I don't have to be that person anymore. But I don't know who I am now, and that's scary.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to accept this new version of yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it would mean acknowledging that I'm more vulnerable than I thought. That I can't just push through everything with sheer willpower. Maybe it means being kinder to myself? Setting boundaries at work, prioritizing my health. But it's hard. I've always defined myself by my work, my success. Without that... who am I?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider that question?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. Like standing on the edge of a cliff. Part of me wants to step back, go back to what I know. But another part... it's like I can see this whole new landscape in front of me. A life where I'm not constantly stressed and anxious, where I actually enjoy my work instead of just enduring it. But I don't know how to get there. I don't even know if I can.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might be a first step?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I need to start being honest. With myself, with my family, with my coworkers. Stop pretending everything's fine when it's not. Maybe... maybe even look into other job options? Something less stressful. It's scary to think about, but the idea of continuing like this for years... that's even scarier.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, after sharing all of this?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've let out something that's been poisoning me for a long time. My chest feels lighter, even though my eyes are stinging with tears. It's like... for the first time in a long time, I can see a way forward. It's not clear, and it's definitely not easy, but it's there. And that... that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Carlos. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about who I am now, post-trauma. Maybe start figuring out what I actually want from my life and career, not just what I think I should want. And... and maybe we could talk more about how to manage the anxiety at work? I know it won't go away overnight, but I'd like to start working on some strategies.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll pick up there next time. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay. A bit raw, but also lighter. Like I've taken a step in the right direction. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
