    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, James?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the cult gathering, it just brought everything back so vividly. The chanting, the strange rituals, the feeling of being trapped... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was palpable. I could almost smell it in the air. I remember looking around at the other members, seeing the glazed looks in their eyes, and feeling this deep sense of dread. It's like I knew something terrible was about to happen, but I was powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel different from when you usually think about it?",
    "Client: It was... clearer, I guess. Usually, when I think about it, it's more fragmented. But going through it step-by-step like that, it felt like I was right back there. I could hear the leader's voice, see the candlelight flickering on the walls. It made me realize how much I've been trying to push these memories away.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How are you coping with those feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. Part of me wants to just forget about it all again, you know? But another part feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I faced it and I'm still here. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That confusion is normal. What do you think this experience means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it means I'm stronger than I thought. For years, I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of the cult. But today, I walked right into those memories and... I survived. It was awful, but I did it. Maybe that means I can face other things I've been avoiding too.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How might this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding social gatherings because they remind me of the cult meetings. But maybe... maybe I could try attending my son's school play next month. It's in a crowded auditorium, which usually freaks me out, but I think I might be able to handle it now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great goal. What strategies could help you manage that situation?",
    "Client: I could... use those breathing exercises we practiced. And maybe I could sit near the exit, so I don't feel trapped. Oh, and I could tell my wife about my concerns beforehand, so she can support me if I get anxious.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How do you feel about your progress today?",
    "Client: It's... surprising, actually. I came in dreading this session, but now I feel... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like I've taken a step forward. It's still scary, and I know there's a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can actually get better.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful, James. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work more on strategies for managing flashbacks? They still catch me off guard sometimes, especially at night. And... I'd like to talk more about how to explain all this to my kids. They're starting to notice that something's wrong, and I want to be honest with them without scaring them.",
    "Therapist: Those are great topics. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For pushing me to do this, even though it was hard. I was skeptical about this therapy at first, but I think it's actually helping. It's not easy, but... I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, James. I'm here to support you. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again."
