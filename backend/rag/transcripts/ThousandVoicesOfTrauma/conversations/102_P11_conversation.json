    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Ramirez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The earthquake, the chaos... it all came flooding back. I could almost feel the ground moving beneath my feet again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds. The rumbling of the earth, people screaming, buildings crumbling... It's like it was happening all over again. And the helplessness, you know? I felt so damn helpless, just like I did back then.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little different this time? I mean, I was scared, definitely. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar panic. But I also felt... maybe a tiny bit more in control? Like, I knew I was here, in this room, even while I was remembering. That's new.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How do you make sense of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's because we've been working on this for a while now? Like, part of me knows I'm safe here, even when I'm remembering the worst moments. It's still terrifying, don't get me wrong, but there's this small voice in the back of my head saying, \"You're okay. This is just a memory.\"",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does this relate to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I'm not as jumpy lately when I hear loud noises. Don't get me wrong, I still get startled, but I recover faster. It's like... I can remind myself that I'm safe now, even if part of me is still scared. And, um, I've been sleeping a little better too. Not great, but... better.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I... I've been thinking about my family more. About how I pushed them away after the earthquake. I was so angry, so scared... I couldn't handle their concern. But now, I'm wondering if maybe I should try to reconnect. It's scary, but... maybe it's time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a big step. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Terrified, honestly. But also... hopeful? I miss them. And I'm starting to think that maybe, just maybe, I don't have to do this all alone. It's just... it's hard to let people in when you feel so broken, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What do you think might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe talking to my sister first? She always understood me best. And maybe... maybe telling her about this therapy? I don't know. It's all so overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Small steps can make a big difference. What's one thing you could do this week?",
    "Client: I could... I could send her a text, maybe? Just to say hi. That doesn't seem too scary. And maybe... maybe I could try that grounding technique we talked about when I start feeling overwhelmed? The one where I name things I can see and touch?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a tiny piece of the weight I've been carrying. It's still hard, and I'm still scared a lot of the time, but... maybe there's hope? I don't know. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of your hard work. What else?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm proud of myself. A little bit. For doing this, for trying. It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but... I'm doing it. And maybe, just maybe, things can get better. I want them to get better.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to sit quietly for a minute, if that's okay? Just to... I don't know, let everything settle. And maybe... maybe we could end with that breathing exercise? The one that helps me feel grounded? I think that might help me transition back to the rest of my day.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that. Ready when you are."
