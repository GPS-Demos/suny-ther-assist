    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",

    "Therapist: That's okay. Start when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm back in that alley. It's dark, and I can smell garbage and cigarette smoke. I hear shouting, and then... oh God, I see him pull out a knife. My heart is racing, and I feel frozen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I feel tense, like I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The man with the knife, he's pushing someone against the wall. I recognize her... it's mi prima, my cousin. She's crying, begging him to stop. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear. My mouth is dry, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I feel so ashamed that I didn't do anything to help her.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I... I can hear the sound of fabric tearing. My cousin is sobbing, and the man is grunting. I close my eyes, but I can still hear everything. My stomach is churning, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I can barely breathe. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I open my eyes, and I see blood on her clothes. The man is zipping up his pants, and he just... walks away like nothing happened. My cousin is crumpled on the ground, crying. I finally move towards her, but I feel like I'm moving through molasses.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I feel so guilty, so useless. My hands are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I reach my cousin, and she flinches when I touch her. She looks at me with such pain and betrayal in her eyes. I try to speak, but no words come out. I just sit there with her, feeling completely helpless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I feel exhausted, drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: We sit there for what feels like hours. I can hear distant sirens, but they never seem to get closer. My cousin's sobs turn into quiet whimpers. I finally find my voice and whisper, \"Lo siento... I'm so sorry.\" She doesn't respond, just stares blankly ahead.",
    "Therapist: Your current SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. I still feel terrible, but the initial panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Eventually, we stand up. My legs feel weak, and I have to support my cousin. We walk home in silence. The streets are empty, and every shadow makes me jump. When we get to her house, she goes inside without a word. I stand there, feeling lost and broken.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 6. I feel... hollow. Like something fundamental has been shattered inside me.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I walk home alone, replaying everything in my mind. I keep thinking of all the things I should have done differently. When I get home, I lock all the doors and windows, but I still don't feel safe. I curl up in bed, but I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see it all happening again.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel... I don't know. Sad, angry, ashamed. But also... maybe a little relieved to have talked about it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It was hard, but I got through it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did great. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end."
