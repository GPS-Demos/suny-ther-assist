    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's hard to put into words.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear the screeching of tires so clearly, and the crunch of metal. It was like I was right back there in that moment. And the smell of gasoline... I hadn't remembered that before, but it was so strong this time. It's funny how our brains can hold onto these details, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How did reliving those sensations feel?",
    "Client: Terrifying at first. My body tensed up, and I felt that familiar panic rising in my chest. But as we continued, it... it started to feel less overwhelming. Like, I was still there in the memory, but I also knew I was here, safe in this room with you. It's a strange feeling, being in two places at once.",
    "Therapist: That's great awareness, Sarah. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed something different this time. In the past, I've always focused on the fear and helplessness I felt during the accident. But today, I found myself thinking about how I managed to unbuckle my seatbelt and check on the other driver. I've never really acknowledged that before - that I was able to take action even in such a terrifying situation.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... kind of empowering, actually. I've spent so long feeling like a victim, like the accident happened to me and I was powerless. But remembering that I took action, that I helped... it makes me feel stronger. Like maybe I'm more capable of handling difficult situations than I've been giving myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this relate to your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm stronger than I thought. That even though I'm still struggling with the aftermath of the accident, I have resources within myself to cope and heal. It's like, if I could act in that moment of crisis, maybe I can be more active in my recovery now, instead of feeling so helpless all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great connection. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I noticed that the guilt I usually feel wasn't as intense this time. I've always blamed myself for not being able to avoid the other car, but going through it again, I could see more clearly that there really wasn't anything I could have done differently. It happened so fast, and I did the best I could in that moment.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift in perspective feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Don't get me wrong, I still feel awful that the accident happened at all, but the crushing weight of guilt isn't quite as heavy. It's like I can breathe a little easier. And it makes me wonder what other aspects of my life I might be unnecessarily blaming myself for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on being kinder to myself. Not just about the accident, but in general. I've been so hard on myself for so long, always assuming the worst about my actions and decisions. Maybe I can try to look at things more objectively, like we did with the accident today. Give myself the benefit of the doubt sometimes, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. I noticed that talking about the accident today was hard, but not as impossible as I thought it would be. It's like, each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier. Don't get me wrong, it's still challenging, but I don't feel as overwhelmed or paralyzed by fear as I did in our earlier sessions. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience in this therapy. How do you feel about that change?",
    "Client: It's encouraging, I think. It gives me hope that maybe, with time and more work, I can get to a place where thinking about the accident doesn't completely derail me. Where it becomes just a thing that happened, not this all-consuming force in my life. That feels... really good to think about.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic, I guess? It's still hard, and there are moments when I want to give up. But sessions like today remind me why I'm doing this. I want my life back, you know? I want to be able to drive again without panicking, to not flinch at every loud noise. And for the first time in a while, I feel like that might actually be possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I'm feeling pretty drained, to be honest. But also... I don't know, lighter somehow? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for a long time. I know we still have a lot of work to do, but I'm feeling more ready for it than I have in a while. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. You've done great work today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths, maybe do that grounding exercise we've practiced before. Just to help me transition back into the rest of my day. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that together."
