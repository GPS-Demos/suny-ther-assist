    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's been so long since I've really thought about what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our backyard. It's a hot summer day, and I can feel the sun beating down on my skin. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine from my mother's garden. I'm playing with my toy cars in the dirt, making little roads and tunnels.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else is happening around you?",
    "Client: I can hear the neighbors' kids playing nearby, their laughter carrying over the fence. My older sister is inside, probably watching TV. And then... then I hear it. A low growl coming from the corner of the yard.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... about a 4, I think.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I look up, and there's this massive dog. It's not ours - must've jumped the fence. Its fur is matted and dirty, and its eyes... God, its eyes are wild. I freeze, my hand still clutching my favorite red car.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog takes a step towards me. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear. It's like my feet are rooted to the ground. I can hear its heavy panting, see the saliva dripping from its mouth. And then... and then it lunges.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to scream, but no sound comes out. The dog's teeth sink into my arm, and the pain... it's excruciating. I can feel its hot breath on my skin, smell the rotten stench from its mouth. I'm falling backwards, and all I can see is fur and teeth and those wild, angry eyes.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in the office.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's so vivid. I can almost feel the pain again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm on the ground now, and the dog is on top of me. Its weight is crushing me, I can barely breathe. I'm screaming now, finally finding my voice. \"Help! Help me!\" But no one's coming. The dog is shaking its head, tearing at my arm, and I'm certain I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I... I know. It's just... it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear my father's voice. He's shouting, running towards us. The dog lets go of my arm and turns towards him. I'm lying there, bleeding, watching as my father grabs a garden hoe and swings it at the dog.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Relieved, but still terrified. My arm is throbbing, and I can see blood everywhere. The dog is yelping now, backing away from my father.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the iron scent of my own blood. My clothes are torn and dirty. I'm sobbing uncontrollably, and I can hear my mother's screams from the house. She must have heard the commotion.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: My father has chased the dog away. He's running back to me now, his face pale with shock. He scoops me up in his arms, and I can feel the strength in his grip. He's saying something, but I can't make out the words over the sound of my own crying.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be in your father's arms?",
    "Client: Safe... but I'm still in so much pain. I can feel the warmth of my blood soaking through my shirt. My father is running towards the house, yelling for my mother to call an ambulance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening now?",
    "Client: We're inside the house. My mother is there, her hands shaking as she tries to wrap a towel around my arm. My sister is crying in the corner. I can hear sirens in the distance, getting closer.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. The worst is over.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're asking questions, but I can't seem to speak. I'm just staring at my arm, at the torn flesh and the blood. One of them gives me a shot, and the pain starts to dull.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Numb. Shocked. Like this isn't really happening to me. They're lifting me onto a stretcher, and I can see the worry in my parents' eyes. My mother is crying, stroking my hair, telling me everything will be okay.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The coolness of the metal stretcher against my skin. The gentle bounce as they wheel me to the ambulance. The flashing lights, so bright they hurt my eyes. And this... this overwhelming sense of vulnerability. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I'm starting to feel more distant from it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay.",
    "Therapist: Slowly open your eyes. Look around the room. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see your bookshelf. The plant in the corner. The sunlight coming through the window.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. A bit shaky. But... also relieved, I think. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well today, Amir. How do you feel about what we accomplished?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I'm glad we did it. I've never talked about it in such detail before. It's like... like I can look at it now without being completely overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session. Can you tell me three things you can see, three things you can hear, and three things you can feel right now?",
    "Client: I can see the clock on your wall, the painting behind you, and my own hands. I can hear the ticking of the clock, the faint sound of traffic outside, and my own breathing. I can feel the softness of this chair, the coolness of the air conditioning, and the weight of my feet on the floor.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: More centered. More... present.",
    "Therapist: That's great, Amir. We'll end our session here. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. You've done some hard work.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
