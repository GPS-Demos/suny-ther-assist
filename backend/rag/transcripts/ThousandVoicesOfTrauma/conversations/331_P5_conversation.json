    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's unsettling.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But I'm not sure I fully understand what it entails. Could you explain it a bit more?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memory in a safe environment. It helps process the experience.",
    "Client: I see. But won't that make me feel worse? I've spent years trying to forget that incident.",
    "Therapist: It may be difficult initially, but it's crucial for healing. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm apprehensive, but I trust your expertise. I want to overcome this, for my family's sake too. They've been so supportive. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it. It might be emotionally intense, but I'll be here to support you.",
    "Client: That sounds challenging. I'm worried about becoming overwhelmed. What if I can't handle it? My anxiety tends to spike in stressful situations.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your understanding. It's been difficult carrying this burden, especially as a professional and a father. The racial aspect of the trauma... it's affected how I view the world.",
    "Therapist: I understand. This process can help reshape those perceptions. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. It's strange, feeling both scared and hopeful at the same time. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll take it session by session. Your commitment is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your guidance. I've always prided myself on being strong for my family, but this experience has shaken that confidence. I'm ready to reclaim it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Shall we start with a breathing exercise to center ourselves?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I've been practicing the techniques you taught me. They've been a lifeline during anxious moments at work and home.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
