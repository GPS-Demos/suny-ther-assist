    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The images were so vivid, like I was right back there in the middle of it all. The sounds of gunfire, the smell of smoke... it's overwhelming. I feel drained, but also somehow... lighter? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The faces. The terrified expressions of the civilians we were trying to evacuate. There was this little girl... (voice breaks) She couldn't have been more than six or seven. Her eyes were so wide with fear. I can't shake that image.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that moment?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. For a moment, I thought I might not be able to continue. But then... I realized I was here, in this room, and not actually there. It was... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: You showed great strength. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that time. Even loud noises or crowded places. But going through it just now, I realize that maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Maybe I can face these things without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having nightmares about that day. But somehow, talking about it like this... it feels different. Like I'm taking control of the narrative, you know? Instead of the memory controlling me.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start trying to do some of the things I've been avoiding. Like, there's a Vietnamese restaurant near my place that I've wanted to try, but the smells... they reminded me too much of that day. But now, I'm thinking I might be able to handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How else has this experience affected you?",
    "Client: It's made me realize how much I've been isolating myself. I've pushed away friends, family... anyone who might ask about my time in the service. But maybe... maybe I don't have to carry this burden alone. Talking about it here, it's hard, but it's also... relieving.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep pushing forward with this therapy. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. And maybe... maybe I'll reach out to some of my old buddies from the unit. We went through this together, after all.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel. It's not going to be easy, but I think I'm ready to face it head-on.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For guiding me through this, for helping me face these memories. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time, I feel like I might actually be able to move past this and reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. What would you like to focus on next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on some strategies for dealing with triggers in everyday life? Like, how to ground myself if I start feeling overwhelmed in public places?",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. We'll explore that next time. How do you feel about ending for today?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready. It's been intense, but... good. I feel like I've made real progress today. Thank you again for your support and guidance.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Take care of yourself this week."
