    "Therapist: Mrs. Johnson, today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, doctor. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. Ever since that terrible day when I was held hostage at the bank, I've tried so hard to push those memories away. The idea of purposely bringing them back... it's frightening. But I trust you, and I know you wouldn't suggest this if it wasn't important. Can you tell me more about why we're doing this?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's to help process the trauma. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose my main concern is... will this make things worse? I've been struggling with depression since my husband passed, and I'm worried that reliving that hostage situation might push me over the edge. I'm not as young as I used to be, and sometimes I wonder if I have the strength to face all this.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. This process is designed to help, not harm. How can I support you?",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear, doctor. I appreciate your understanding. I think what would help me most is knowing what to expect. Will I have to describe everything in detail? And what if I get too overwhelmed? I've lived alone since my husband died, and I'm not used to sharing such intense emotions with anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can pause anytime. What else would help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Thank you, that's comforting to know. I think it would help if I could hold something familiar during the session. Perhaps the family photo I always carry in my purse? And maybe if we could have a glass of water nearby. Sometimes when I get anxious, my throat feels very dry. Oh, and is it alright if we keep the curtains open? I find the sunlight calming.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are excellent ideas. How else can we make you comfortable?",
    "Client: You're very kind, doctor. I think those things will help a lot. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a bit more prepared now. I suppose one last thing - could you remind me why this is important? I know you've explained before, but sometimes with my age, I find I need things repeated. How will this help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: This helps process the memory, reducing its power over you. Your courage is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Thank you for explaining that again, doctor. It helps to be reminded of the purpose behind all this. I appreciate your patience with me. Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. After all, I've survived so much already - the accident years ago, losing my husband, and that dreadful hostage situation. If facing these memories can help me find some peace, then it's worth the effort. Shall we start?",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Let's begin. Remember, you're safe here."
