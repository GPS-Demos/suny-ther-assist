    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene you remember?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure if I can do this. It's a dark room, I think. I can smell something musty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm in this small, cramped space. It's like a closet, but bigger. There are other children here too. We're all huddled together, trying to be quiet. I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can hear footsteps outside. They're getting closer. My heart is racing. I want to run, but there's nowhere to go. The door opens, and there's this man... He's big, intimidating. He's speaking, but I can't understand the language.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: He's pointing at us, choosing... Oh god, I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) Alright. He... he grabs my arm. His grip is so tight it hurts. I'm being pulled out of the room. The other kids look terrified. I want to scream, but I know I can't make a sound.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're walking down a hallway. It's dimly lit. I can hear muffled sounds from other rooms. I'm shaking. He pushes me into another room. There's a bed, and... and...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're here with me now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) There's a man sitting on the bed. He looks at me like... like I'm not even human. Just a thing. The big man who brought me in is talking to him. They're exchanging money. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: The man on the bed stands up. He's coming towards me. I want to disappear, to become invisible. I'm frozen. I can't move. He reaches out to touch me and I... I...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing incredible work.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're here, in this room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (after a pause) Okay. I'm... I'm here. But it feels so real. Like it just happened.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're very courageous for facing this.",
    "Client: I just... I feel so helpless when I think about it. Like that little boy who couldn't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: It wasn't your fault. You survived.",
    "Client: I know that now, but... it's still hard. Sometimes I wonder how I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly resilient. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. Angry. But... also a little relieved, I think. Like I've let out something I've been holding in for so long.",

    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. Talking about it, I mean.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take care of yourself today."
