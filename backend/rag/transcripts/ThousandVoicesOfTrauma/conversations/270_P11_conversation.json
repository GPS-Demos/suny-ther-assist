    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I was first taken... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to bury for years. I can still feel the rough hands grabbing me, the panic rising in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the fear was paralyzing. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm never going to see my family again.\" And the shame... I was a grown man, but I felt so helpless, so weak. I couldn't fight them off. I just... I just let it happen.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to share that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. But also, I don't know, maybe a little freeing? I've never really talked about this before. Always thought I should just man up and forget about it. But saying it out loud, it's like... it's real now. Can't pretend it didn't happen anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge, you know? Always looking over my shoulder, expecting the worst. Can't trust anyone. It's why I started drinking, I think. To numb it all out. But that just made everything worse in the long run.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: That I'm... stronger than I thought, maybe? I survived that. I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? And maybe... maybe it wasn't my fault. I've always blamed myself for not fighting harder, but... they were stronger, there were more of them. I did what I had to do to survive.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this change things for you?",
    "Client: I don't know. Maybe I can start to forgive myself a little? Stop being so hard on myself all the time. And maybe... maybe I can start opening up to my wife more. She's always wanted to know, but I've kept her at arm's length. It's not fair to her.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to keep doing this. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of running away. And maybe I'll talk to my wife tonight. Just a little. Baby steps, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's great. How can we support you in that?",
    "Client: Just... keep pushing me, I guess. Don't let me off the hook when I try to avoid the tough stuff. And maybe... maybe some strategies for when the memories get too intense at home? Sometimes they just hit me out of nowhere.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely work on that. Anything else you want to address?",
    "Client: Not right now. I'm pretty drained, to be honest. But... thank you. For listening. For not judging. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll pick this up next session. Take care."
