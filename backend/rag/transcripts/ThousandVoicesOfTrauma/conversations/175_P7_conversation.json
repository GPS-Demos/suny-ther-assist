    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was sitting in my seat, 14C, aisle seat. The flight had just taken off from Dubai. I remember feeling the plane shake a bit, but I thought it was just turbulence. Then suddenly, there was this loud bang, and the plane started to descend rapidly. People were screaming, oxygen masks dropped down...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane was tilting to one side, and I could see the ground getting closer through the window across the aisle. I was trying to put on my oxygen mask, but my hands were shaking so much. The flight attendants were yelling instructions, but I couldn't understand what they were saying over all the noise and panic.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell something burning. It's acrid, like melting plastic or electrical wires. The plane is shuddering violently now. I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. I can hear a child crying somewhere behind me, and a man in the row in front is praying loudly in Arabic.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks aren't working properly. I'm gasping for air, and my chest feels tight. I'm convinced we're going to crash, and I start thinking about my family, my girlfriend... I regret not calling my mom before the flight. The plane is falling so fast now, my stomach feels like it's in my throat.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's an enormous impact. My head slams forward, then back against the headrest. Everything goes dark for a moment. When I open my eyes, the cabin is filled with smoke and debris. People are screaming and crying. I'm disoriented, but I realize we've hit the ground. My seatbelt is jammed, and I'm struggling to get it off.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my right leg is pinned under the seat in front of me. I can smell fuel now, mixed with the smoke. Someone is shouting that we need to evacuate. I'm panicking, trying to free my leg. The woman next to me is unconscious, blood trickling from a gash on her forehead.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in the present.",
    "Client: I finally wrench my leg free, but it's painful to put weight on it. I start moving towards the nearest exit, which is partly blocked by twisted metal. People are pushing and shoving. I help the woman next to me regain consciousness and guide her towards the exit. We're stumbling over seats and luggage.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Continue.",
    "Client: As we near the exit, I can feel intense heat. There are flames licking at the fuselage outside. The emergency slide has deployed, but it's chaos. People are jumping and sliding down in a frenzy. I hesitate for a moment, terrified of the flames, but the flight attendant urges us to jump.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm absolutely terrified. My heart is racing, and I can barely breathe. But I know I have to get out. I help the woman onto the slide, then I jump. The slide is so hot it burns through my clothes. I hit the ground hard and roll away from the plane. The heat is intense, and there's thick, black smoke everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: I stumble away from the wreckage, coughing and gasping. My leg is throbbing with pain, and I realize I have burns on my hands and arms. I can hear sirens in the distance, but they seem so far away. People are scattered around, some injured, some helping others. I collapse on the ground, unable to believe I've survived.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing the experience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is still racing, and I can feel myself shaking. It's like I was right back there again. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief, like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was harder than I expected, but I think it helped. Can we take a break now? I need a moment to collect myself.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves in the present."
