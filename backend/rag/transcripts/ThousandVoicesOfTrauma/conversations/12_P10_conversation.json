    "Therapist: Welcome, Jason. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My stomach's been in knots all morning thinking about this. But I guess that's normal, right?",
    "Therapist: It's completely normal. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting at my desk at home. It's early evening, and the sun's just starting to set. I can see the orange glow through my window. I'm scrolling through my social media feed, just like any other day. But then... then I see it.",
    "Therapist: What do you see, Jason?",
    "Client: It's a post. About me. Someone's shared a photo of me from a party last weekend, but they've... they've edited it. Made it look like I'm doing something I'm not. The comments are already piling up. People are saying such horrible things.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel sick. My heart's racing. I can't believe this is happening. I'm scrolling through the comments, and each one feels like a punch to the gut. Some of these people, I thought they were my friends.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably around 70. Maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay, take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right, okay. I'm trying to figure out what to do. Should I comment? Should I message the person who posted it? My hands are shaking as I type out a response, but I delete it. I'm afraid anything I say will just make it worse.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I close the app. But I can't stop thinking about it. I keep picking up my phone, checking for notifications. Each time I do, there are more comments, more shares. It's spreading like wildfire.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Absolutely helpless. And angry. I want to scream, to throw my phone across the room. But I can't look away. It's like watching a car crash in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe, Jason. You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 80, 85?",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay, I'm... I'm alright.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I decide to call my best friend, Mark. I need someone to talk to, someone to tell me this isn't as bad as it seems. But when I call... he doesn't pick up. I try again. Still nothing. And then I see it - he's commented on the post. He's laughing along with everyone else.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly painful. What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Betrayed. Completely and utterly betrayed. I thought I could count on him, but he's... he's joined in with the others. I feel so alone. So isolated.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling, Jason. It's okay to feel it.",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I can feel tears starting to form. I'm trying to hold them back, but I can't. They're streaming down my face. I feel so weak, so pathetic.",
    "Therapist: You're not weak, Jason. You're human. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 90?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: Right, yeah. I'm here. I'm safe. *deep breath*",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. I feel paralyzed. I want to defend myself, but I'm afraid of making it worse. I want to reach out to someone, but I don't know who I can trust anymore. The notifications keep coming, each one like a little stab.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I turn off my phone. I can't bear to look at it anymore. But the silence is almost worse. My mind is racing, imagining what people are saying, who else might have seen it. I feel like my whole life is crumbling around me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My jaw is clenched, my shoulders are up to my ears. My stomach feels like it's tied in knots. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Try to relax those muscles, Jason. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Okay, I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens as the evening progresses?",
    "Client: I... I can't sleep. I toss and turn, replaying everything in my mind. Every time I close my eyes, I see those comments, those laughing emojis. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. It's like everyone can see right through me, and they're all laughing.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Jason. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I did survive it. But it felt like I wouldn't. Like my whole world was ending.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me about the next morning?",
    "Client: I... I wake up, and for a split second, I forget. But then it all comes crashing back. I reach for my phone before I can stop myself. There are so many notifications, I can barely see my background image.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I take a deep breath. I know I need to face this. I start scrolling through the messages. Some are from people I thought were friends, asking if I'm okay. Others are from people I barely know, saying they're there if I need to talk. It's... it's not all bad.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Surprised, I guess. And... and a little hopeful. Maybe everyone isn't against me after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive realization. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I decide to post a statement. Nothing long or dramatic, just... just the truth. That the photo was edited, that it's not who I am. My hand is shaking as I hit 'post', but I feel... I feel a little stronger.",
    "Therapist: That took courage, Jason. How do you feel after posting?",
    "Client: Scared, still. But also... also a little proud. Like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's pause here for a moment. How are you feeling now, in this room?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's still hard to think about, but... but I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today, Jason. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 now, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, you survived this experience, and you're stronger for it. Is there anything else you want to share before we end?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening. For helping me face this. I know it's not over, but... but I feel like I can handle it a little better now.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Jason. You've shown remarkable strength today. We'll continue working on this in our next session. For now, take some time to relax and practice your coping strategies.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Jason. I'll see you next week."
