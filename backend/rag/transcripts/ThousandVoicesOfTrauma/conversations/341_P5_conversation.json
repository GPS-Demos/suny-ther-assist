    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Singh. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the hospital lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it all.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it involves. Is it going to be intense? I'm worried about reliving everything that happened at the hospital when my grandmother passed away.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into. Will this help with the nightmares and the constant anxiety I've been feeling?",
    "Therapist: It should. The goal is to process the trauma memory. Ready to hear how?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Singh. Please go ahead and explain it to me. I want to get better, to stop feeling so... haunted by what happened.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory in a safe environment. You'll describe it in detail.",
    "Client: Describe it? You mean, like, tell the whole story of what happened that day at the hospital? I'm not sure I can do that without breaking down. It's still so vivid in my mind, especially the moment when... when she flatlined.",
    "Therapist: Yes, but at your own pace. I'll guide you through it. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds scary, to be honest. But if you think it will help, I'm willing to try. Will you be there the whole time? And what if I can't handle it and need to stop?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime you need. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. I appreciate your support, Dr. Singh. Can you tell me what I might experience during this process? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions, physical sensations. It's normal and temporary. Ready to proceed?",
    "Client: I think I am. It's strange, I feel scared but also a little hopeful. This might finally help me move past that terrible day. Before we start, is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'll do my best to be open. I really want this to work. I'm tired of feeling stuck in that moment, you know? It's affecting my studies, my relationships... everything. I'm ready to start, Dr. Singh. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable, Rahul. Let's start with a deep breath..."
