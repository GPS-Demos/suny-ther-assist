    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge. It's been a rough week, you know? The cravings have been pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. It's just... talking about the cult stuff, it brings up a lot. But I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: You're right, it is important. Let's start by getting you to focus on that memory. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 5 or 6. My heart's already beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay, thank you. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the scene to me. Remember to use present tense.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm 22 years old. I've been in the cult for about a year now. It's early morning, and I'm sitting in this dimly lit room. There are about 20 of us, all cross-legged on the floor. The air is thick with incense, and it's making me feel a little dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Good, Carlos. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see the other members. They all look so... peaceful. But I feel anything but peaceful. My stomach is in knots. The leader, he's at the front of the room. He's talking about how we need to cut ties with our families, that they're holding us back from true enlightenment.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I'm... I'm trying to hide it by gripping my knees. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to leave, but I'm scared. What if they're right? What if my family is the problem?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling, Carlos. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader, he's looking right at me now. He says, \"Carlos, I sense hesitation in you. Your family is poisoning your mind.\" I... I can't breathe. It feels like the walls are closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now. God, this feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. My legs feel like jelly. I say, \"I need some air.\" The leader's face, it changes. He looks... angry. He says, \"Sit down, Carlos. You're not leaving.\" I feel trapped. I look around, hoping someone will help me, but they're all just staring blankly.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I'm sweating. I feel like I might pass out. But there's also this... this anger building up inside me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do with that anger?",
    "Client: I... I clench my fists. I look the leader in the eye and say, \"No. I'm leaving.\" My voice is shaking, but I say it. And then I just... I run. I push past people and run out the door.",
    "Therapist: Good, Carlos. Take a deep breath. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel relieved, but also terrified. What if they come after me? What if my family doesn't want me back?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is a memory. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 6 now. Still pretty high, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens after you run out?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm outside now. The sun is so bright, it hurts my eyes. I'm running down the street, not even sure where I'm going. I can hear shouting behind me, but I don't look back. I just keep running until my lungs burn.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you run?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I've made a huge mistake. That maybe I should go back. But then I think about my mom, how worried she must be. And I keep running.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to think about your mom?",
    "Client: It... it hurts. I feel guilty for cutting her off. But also... hopeful? Like maybe I can fix things.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I find a payphone. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely dial. But I call my mom. When she answers, I just... I break down. I'm sobbing, telling her I'm sorry, that I want to come home.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly emotional. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also lighter somehow. Like a weight has been lifted.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4, I think. Still anxious, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. Let's stay with this memory a bit longer. What happens after you talk to your mom?",
    "Client: She... she tells me she loves me. That she'll come pick me up, no questions asked. I'm sitting on the curb, waiting. I keep looking over my shoulder, afraid they'll find me.",
    "Therapist: How long does it feel like you're waiting?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only about 30 minutes. When I see her car turn the corner, I... I start crying again. I'm so relieved, but also so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What happens when your mom arrives?",
    "Client: She... she jumps out of the car and just hugs me. She's crying too. I can feel how much she's missed me, how worried she's been. I keep apologizing, but she just holds me tighter.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How does it feel to remember this?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm grateful for my mom, for her unconditional love. But I also feel so much regret for the pain I caused her.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal feelings, Carlos. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 3 now. I feel sad, but also... kind of at peace?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath and slowly look around the room.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, I'm here. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today, Carlos. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But I also feel like I've accomplished something. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you've done. You should be proud of yourself. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For helping me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Your courage and commitment to this process are admirable. We'll continue to work through this together."
