    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It felt so real, like I was right back there, you know? I can still hear the screeching tires and smell the burnt rubber. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What emotions are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about how I froze. I should have done something, called for help sooner. Maybe if I had, things would have turned out differently.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's like this heavy weight in my chest. I was just standing there, watching it all unfold. The crash, the screaming... I feel like I failed those people. I'm supposed to be studying to help others, but when it really mattered, I couldn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me doubt myself. Like, am I really cut out for this? What if I freeze up again when someone needs me? It's affecting my studies too. I'm struggling to focus in class, especially when we discuss emergency scenarios.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my throat. It's hard to swallow. And my shoulders... they feel so tense, like I'm bracing for something.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the accident in my head. The sound of metal crunching, the smell of gasoline. I'm thinking about the faces of the people involved, wondering if they're okay now. And then I start spiraling, imagining all the \"what ifs.\" What if it happens again? What if next time it's someone I love?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to right after the incident?",
    "Client: They're... less intense now, I guess. Right after, I couldn't sleep. I'd jump at every loud noise. Now it's more of a constant undercurrent of anxiety. But talking about it like this, it brings it all back to the surface.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping now versus then?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, talking about it. That's something I couldn't do before. I used to try to push it all away, pretend it never happened. But that didn't really work. I'm still scared, but I'm facing it now. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does it feel to acknowledge that progress?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels proud, like I'm taking steps forward. But another part feels frustrated that I'm not \"over it\" yet. I want to move on, you know? I'm tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: Can you expand on that frustration?",
    "Client: It's like... I know logically that healing takes time, but emotionally, I'm impatient. I see my classmates going about their lives, and I feel left behind. I'm angry at myself for not being able to just snap out of it. And then I feel guilty for being angry because I know it's not that simple.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to other challenges you've faced?",
    "Client: I've never experienced anything like this before. But... I guess it reminds me of when I first moved here for school. I felt so out of place, like I didn't belong. This feels similar - like I'm disconnected from everyone else, living in a different reality.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel more connected?",
    "Client: Talking about it, surprisingly. Not just here, but with my boyfriend too. He's been really supportive. And volunteering at the campus crisis hotline - it makes me feel like I'm doing something positive, even if I couldn't help during the actual accident.",
    "Therapist: How does that volunteering impact your view of the incident?",
    "Client: It's... healing, I think. When I'm able to help someone, even in a small way, it chips away at that guilt. It reminds me that I'm not helpless. And hearing others' stories... it puts things in perspective. I'm not alone in struggling with trauma.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I'm stronger than I thought. There are days when I want to give up, but I keep pushing forward. And I'm learning to be kinder to myself. I used to beat myself up for having bad days, but now I'm trying to accept that it's part of the healing process.",
    "Therapist: How does that self-kindness feel?",
    "Client: It's... unfamiliar, but good. Like a warm blanket. It doesn't fix everything, but it makes the hard days a little easier to bear. I'm starting to believe that maybe I don't have to be perfect to be worthy.",
    "Therapist: What do you hope to gain from continuing this work?",
    "Client: Peace, I guess. I want to be able to drive past the accident site without my heart racing. I want to feel confident in my abilities again. And... I want to use this experience to become a more empathetic healthcare provider in the future.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about these hopes affect you?",
    "Client: It's motivating. It reminds me why I'm doing this, why I'm pushing through the discomfort. But it's also a little scary. What if I can't achieve those things? What if I'm always haunted by this?",
    "Therapist: What would you say to a friend with similar fears?",
    "Client: I'd... I'd tell them that it's okay to be scared, but not to let that fear stop them. That healing isn't linear, and setbacks don't erase progress. That they're brave for facing their trauma, and that bravery will carry them through.",
    "Therapist: And how does it feel to apply that to yourself?",
    "Client: It's... powerful. And a little overwhelming. I'm not used to giving myself that kind of grace. But it feels right. Like maybe I deserve that kindness too.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take this week towards self-kindness?",
    "Client: I could... maybe start a gratitude journal? Write down one thing each day that I'm proud of, no matter how small. It might help me focus on progress instead of perfectionism.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This was intense, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
