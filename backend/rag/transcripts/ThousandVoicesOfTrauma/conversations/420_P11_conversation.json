    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that animal attack... it's still so vivid. I can still hear the growling, the screams... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching that poor person being mauled and not being able to do anything. I froze. I just... stood there. (voice trembles) I keep thinking I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. For a moment, I thought I might panic, but... I managed to stay with it. It's strange, but it felt a little less overwhelming this time.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I don't know. Maybe... maybe I'm starting to process it better? It's still awful, but it doesn't feel as all-consuming as before. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many find the intensity changes over time. How does this connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm less jumpy when I hear sudden noises. And yesterday, I actually watched a nature documentary without changing the channel. That's... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly can be. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Relieved, I guess. And a bit proud. It's like... I'm slowly reclaiming parts of my life. But there's still so much to work through. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely normal again.",
    "Therapist: What does \"normal\" mean to you in this context?",
    "Client: (sighs) I suppose it means not constantly being on edge. Being able to enjoy life without this... shadow hanging over me. To go to the park without scanning for potential threats. To sleep through the night without nightmares.",
    "Therapist: Those are meaningful goals. How might today's session contribute to that?",
    "Client: I think... it's showing me that I can face these memories without completely falling apart. That's huge for me. And maybe, if I can do this here, I can start applying it to real-life situations too.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What might that look like?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try visiting the local petting zoo. Start small, you know? Be around animals in a controlled environment. It's scary to think about, but... I think I might be ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful idea. How does it feel to consider that step?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? Like I'm taking back control. It's a mix of excitement and fear, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. What might help you feel prepared for that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe practicing some of the breathing exercises we've worked on. And reminding myself that I'm safe, that it's not the same situation. Maybe even bringing a friend for support.",

    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anything else you'd like to address?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. I didn't think that was possible a few months ago.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How would you like to close today's session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we end with a quick relaxation exercise? I think it would help me transition back to my day feeling a bit more centered.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
