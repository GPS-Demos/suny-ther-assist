    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memories are so vivid, it's almost like I can smell the musty air of that room again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How trapped. It's like... I was just a commodity, you know? Something to be bought and sold. I remember feeling so small, so insignificant. And there's this voice in my head that keeps saying, \"You should have done something. You should have fought harder.\" But I know, logically, that there was nothing I could have done.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's tense. My shoulders are hunched, and I can feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is trying to make itself smaller, to hide. And my hands... they're shaking a bit. I didn't even notice until now.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: There's anger, definitely. Anger at the people who did this, at the system that allows it to happen. But there's also this deep sadness. It's like... mourning for the person I was before all this happened. And shame. Even though I know it wasn't my fault, there's still this nagging feeling of shame.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions compare to how you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's different, but similar in some ways. Back then, the fear was overwhelming. It was all-consuming. Now, the fear is still there, but it's more... manageable, I guess? It's like I'm observing it from a distance. But the sadness and the anger, those feel stronger now than they did then. Back then, I was just trying to survive. Now, I have the space to actually feel all of these emotions.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's the hardest part about sitting with these feelings now?",
    "Client: The hardest part is... accepting that it happened, I think. There's a part of me that still wants to deny it, to pretend it was all a bad dream. And it's hard to reconcile the person I am now with the person who went through that. It's like... there's a disconnect. I look in the mirror, and I see this successful professional, but inside, I still feel like that scared, powerless person.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to your broader journey of recovery?",
    "Client: It's... it's a reminder of how far I've come, I suppose. A few years ago, I couldn't even think about what happened without having a panic attack. Now, I can talk about it, even if it's still difficult. But it also shows me how much work I still have to do. There's still so much pain, so much unresolved trauma. It's like... peeling back layers of an onion. Each time we do this, I uncover something new.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to feel safe and grounded?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment to just breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, in this room, and that I'm safe now. Maybe... maybe we could do one of those grounding exercises? The one where we focus on things we can see and touch in the room? That usually helps bring me back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see the green plant in the corner. The sunlight coming through the window. The soft, blue cushion I'm sitting on. Your kind face. The clock on the wall... It's ticking, I can hear it now. I can feel the fabric of my shirt against my skin, and the solidness of the chair beneath me. I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit more present now.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... calmer. The anxiety is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. It's like... the volume has been turned down a bit. I feel more anchored in the present. The memories are still there, but they're not as vivid or intrusive. I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit proud of myself for getting through that.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on for the rest of our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk more about managing these emotions when they come up outside of therapy. Sometimes, I get triggered at work or when I'm out, and it's hard to deal with. Maybe we could discuss some strategies for coping in those situations?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's explore that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate your support through all of this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. Even if it's slow, it's still progress, right?",
    "Therapist: You're absolutely right. Every step counts. Shall we begin?"
