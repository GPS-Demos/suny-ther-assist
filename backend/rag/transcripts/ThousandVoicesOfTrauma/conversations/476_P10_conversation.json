    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Uh, to be honest, doc, I'm feeling a bit... I don't know, jittery? Like, part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is kinda dreading it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Let's start slow. Remember the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, I'd say I'm at about a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and when you're ready, start describing the cyberbullying incident.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* So, I'm sitting in my room, it's late at night. I've just gotten back from my second tour in Afghanistan. I'm scrolling through Facebook, and... and I see this post. It's about me, but it's not... it's not good.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: It's a picture of me in uniform, but someone's photoshopped it. They've made me look... weak, I guess? Like, they've slimmed down my arms, put makeup on my face. The caption says something like, \"This is what the Army's become. Pathetic.\"",

    "Therapist: Your anger is valid. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Probably a 6. Maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I start reading the comments. God, there are so many. People I thought were my friends are laughing, sharing it. Someone says, \"No wonder we can't win wars anymore.\" Another says, \"Bet he cried when he heard gunfire.\" I... I want to respond, but I can't. My fingers are frozen over the keyboard.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I can feel my heart pounding. I'm... I'm starting to sweat a little.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember to breathe. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"They don't know. They have no idea what it's like out there.\" I want to tell them about the things I've seen, the friends I've lost. But I can't. I just... I just sit there, staring at the screen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard, man.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave for facing this. What happens as you keep looking?",
    "Client: More comments keep popping up. It's like... it's like they're coming faster than I can read them. Someone tags me in the post. Now my phone is blowing up with notifications. I feel... I feel exposed. Vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I start to feel this disconnect. Like, part of me is still in Afghanistan, you know? I can almost hear the gunfire, smell the dust. But I'm here, in my quiet room, and these people... they're tearing me apart with their words.",
    "Therapist: How does that contrast feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's surreal. Like, I've faced actual danger, you know? But this... this feels like a different kind of attack. I can't fight back against this.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I close the laptop. But I can still hear my phone buzzing. I turn it off, but my hands are shaking so bad I almost drop it. I feel... I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. I'm here with you. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Let's take a moment to breathe together.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply, then exhales*",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what happens after you turn off your phone?",
    "Client: I just... I just sit there in the dark. I can feel my heart racing. I keep thinking about all those comments, all those people laughing at me. I start to question everything. Was I really brave out there? Or was I just... just pretending?",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult thoughts. How do you cope with them?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I do cope. I just sit there, feeling like... like I'm suffocating. I want to call someone, but who would understand? My parents are asleep downstairs. They don't even know how to use Facebook.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in that moment?",
    "Client: I need... I need someone to tell me it's not true. That I'm not weak. That what I did over there mattered. But there's no one. I'm just... alone with these thoughts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. How are you feeling right now?",

    "Therapist: That's the exposure working. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I end up just lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see those comments. I keep thinking about my squad, about the guys who didn't make it back. Would they think I'm weak too?",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.5.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The night just... drags on. I keep reaching for my phone, then stopping myself. Part of me wants to see if anyone's defended me. Another part is terrified of seeing more hate. I feel... I feel trapped in my own room.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel during this?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My jaw is clenched. I can feel a headache coming on. It's like... like I'm bracing for an attack that never comes.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens as morning approaches?",
    "Client: I... I haven't slept at all. I can see the sun starting to come up through my window. I feel... drained. Empty. But also on edge. Like, I know I have to face the world, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: What do you do when it's time to get up?",
    "Client: I... I force myself out of bed. My body feels heavy. I avoid looking at my phone or laptop. I can hear my parents moving around downstairs. They have no idea what's happened. I... I don't know how to tell them.",
    "Therapist: That sounds isolating. How do you feel about facing the day?",
    "Client: Terrified, honestly. It's like... it's like I'm going into battle again, but this time I don't have my squad. I don't have my training. I'm just... me. And apparently, that's not enough for people.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel about the experience we just walked through?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough, man. Reliving it like that... I can feel the anxiety in my chest. But... but I guess it's also kinda liberating? Like, I've been carrying this around for so long, and now it's... it's out there.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Carlos. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: Can we... can we just sit quietly for a minute? I need to... to come back to the present, you know?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Still a bit shaky, but... better. Thanks, doc.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today, Carlos. We'll continue to work through this together."
