    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? I'm anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm walking into the university cafeteria. It's lunchtime, and the place is bustling with students. I can smell the mix of different foods - burgers, fries, some kind of curry. I'm carrying my tray, looking for a place to sit.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I spot an empty table and start walking towards it. As I get closer, I notice a group of students nearby. They're all white, and they're looking at me. One of them, a guy with spiky blonde hair, says something to his friends, and they all laugh.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... exposed. Like everyone's eyes are on me. My cheeks are getting hot, and my heart is racing a bit. I'm trying to ignore them, but I can feel their stares.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about 60.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens as you approach the table?",
    "Client: As I get closer to the table, I hear the blonde guy say loudly, \"Looks like the zoo's missing an exhibit.\" His friends laugh even harder. I freeze for a second, my tray shaking in my hands. I... I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I keep walking. My legs feel like lead, but I make it to the table. I sit down, but my hands are trembling so much I can barely hold my fork. I can hear them still laughing and making comments, but I'm trying so hard not to listen.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office. Take a moment to ground yourself if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I... I try to eat, but the food tastes like cardboard. I'm hyper-aware of everything around me. The clinking of cutlery, the chatter of other students, it all seems too loud. I keep my head down, hoping they'll lose interest and leave me alone.",
    "Therapist: And do they?",
    "Client: No... no, they don't. The blonde guy gets up and starts walking towards my table. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. He stops right next to me, and I can smell his cologne. It's overpowering.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. What does the guy do?",
    "Client: He... he leans down and says, \"Hey, Pocahontas, shouldn't you be out hunting buffalo or something?\" His breath smells like mint gum. I feel like I can't breathe. I want to say something, to stand up for myself, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My throat is tight, and my chest feels heavy. My hands are clenched so hard my nails are digging into my palms. I feel hot and cold at the same time.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to look up at him. His face is twisted in this cruel smirk. I open my mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. He laughs and says, \"What's wrong? Don't speak English?\" His friends at the other table are howling with laughter.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. And humiliated. My SUDS is probably 95. I want to disappear, to run away, but I also want to scream at them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I stand up suddenly. My chair scrapes loudly against the floor. Everyone nearby turns to look. I'm shaking, but I manage to say, \"I speak English just fine. And I'm not Pocahontas, I'm Maori. Maybe you should educate yourself before opening your mouth.\"",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of courage. How does it feel to stand up for yourself?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, but also terrifying. My heart is racing, and I'm worried about what they might do next.",
    "Therapist: What happens after you speak?",
    "Client: The guy looks surprised for a moment, then his face twists into anger. He says, \"Oh, look at the savage talking back. Did they teach you that in the jungle?\" His friends are laughing even harder now. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Sarah. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I can't take it anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here in my office, not in that cafeteria. Can you tell me three things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, and your red scarf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, tell me what you do next in the cafeteria.",
    "Client: I... I grab my tray and turn to leave. As I'm walking away, I can hear them making more comments, but I'm trying not to listen. My eyes are burning with tears I'm desperately trying not to shed. I dump my tray in the trash and practically run out of the cafeteria.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go?",
    "Client: I head straight for the bathroom. As soon as I'm inside a stall, I break down. I'm sobbing, trying to muffle the sound with my hands. I can't believe this is happening. I thought university would be different, that people would be more accepting.",
    "Therapist: How long do you stay in the bathroom?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It feels like hours, but it's probably only about 20 minutes. I cry until I have no tears left. Then I just sit there, feeling numb and exhausted.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if I made a mistake coming here. If maybe I should have stayed home in New Zealand. I'm thinking about how unfair it is, how I just wanted to get an education and instead I'm being treated like... like I'm not even human.",
    "Therapist: Those are very painful thoughts. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 85. I'm still upset, but the intensity has faded a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. What do you do when you leave the bathroom?",
    "Client: I splash some cold water on my face and try to make myself look presentable. I have a class in 15 minutes, and I'm debating whether to go or not. Part of me wants to just go back to my dorm and hide.",
    "Therapist: What do you decide?",
    "Client: I... I decide to go to class. I don't want them to win. I don't want to let them stop me from getting my education. But I feel like a ghost walking through the hallways. Every laugh I hear, every glance in my direction makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of strength. How do you feel about that decision now?",
    "Client: I'm proud of myself for not giving up, but I'm also... I don't know. Sad? Angry? That I had to make that decision at all. That I couldn't just be a normal student without all this... this hatred.",
    "Therapist: Those are very valid feelings. As we start to wrap up this imaginal exposure, I want you to think about how you've coped since that day. What strengths have you drawn on?",
    "Client: I... I've tried to connect more with other international students. We've formed a kind of support group. And I've started speaking up more in class, showing that I belong there just as much as anyone else. It's hard, but I'm trying not to let that incident define my entire university experience.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Sarah. You've shown incredible resilience. Now, let's take a few deep breaths together as we come back to the present moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also a little lighter, like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant decrease. You've done wonderful work today, Sarah. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and discuss some coping strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Remember, healing is a process, and you're making great progress. Let's talk about what you can do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day..."
