    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure, to be honest. It's all a bit overwhelming. I can still see her face, you know? My wife's face when I told her about the incident at the supermarket. The way her eyes widened, the slight tremble in her lip... It's like I'm right back there in our kitchen.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Anger, mostly. No, that's not quite right. It's more like... a deep, burning frustration. Why did that have to happen to us? We were just trying to buy groceries, for heaven's sake. And then that young man... the things he said... I've never felt so... so... small. So insignificant. And now, remembering it all, I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy. And there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is reliving that moment all over again. I can hear the rustle of the shopping bags, smell the fresh produce... and then that voice, loud and harsh, cutting through everything. \"Go back where you came from!\" he said. As if we didn't belong here. As if this wasn't our home too.",
    "Therapist: How do those words impact you now?",
    "Client: They... they still sting. Even after all these years. It's not just about that one incident, you know? It's about a lifetime of little moments, of feeling different, of being made to feel like an outsider. And now, without Margaret... she was always my rock, always knew what to say to make things better. Without her, it's like those words have even more power over me.",
    "Therapist: I hear how deeply this has affected you. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had said something back? What if I had stood up for us, for our right to be there? But then I remember the fear. The way Margaret squeezed my hand, silently begging me not to escalate things. And I wonder... am I a coward? Should I have done more? And then I think about all the young people today, still facing the same prejudices. It makes me feel... old. Tired. Like nothing's really changed.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on this memory now differ from when it first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Back then, it was all raw emotion. Shock, fear, anger. Now, there's a sadness to it. A weariness. But also... I don't know if this makes sense, but there's a sort of... clarity? Like I can see how this moment fits into the bigger picture of my life, of our struggles as a community. It still hurts, but it's not just about me anymore. It's about all of us who've faced this kind of treatment.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet, I suppose. On one hand, it makes me feel less alone. Like I'm part of something bigger. But on the other hand, it breaks my heart that so many others have had to go through similar experiences. And without Margaret here to share this realization with... it's lonely. She would have understood. She always did.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're processing a lot. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: The tightness in my chest has eased a bit. But I feel... drained. Like I've run a marathon. My eyes are stinging - I think I've been holding back tears. And there's this heaviness in my limbs. It's as if reliving that memory has taken a physical toll.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and sleep for a week. But another part feels... restless. Like I should be doing something. Maybe... maybe talking to my grandkids about this? Sharing our family's story? I don't know. It's all a bit muddled right now.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to sit with these feelings. What stands out most to you from this exercise?",
    "Client: I think... it's the realization that this memory, as painful as it is, is part of who I am. It's shaped me, shaped our family. And while I can't change what happened, maybe... maybe I can use it to help others understand. To make sure the younger generations know our history, so they can build a better future. That's what Margaret would have wanted.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like I'm honoring Margaret's memory, and all we went through together. But it's also scary. Opening up old wounds, you know? But maybe... maybe that's how we heal. By facing it head-on, by sharing our stories. I just wish... I wish she was here to do it with me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to miss her. How can you honor her as you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... by being brave. By speaking up when I see injustice, the way she always encouraged me to. And by loving fiercely, the way she did. Maybe I can start by having some real conversations with my family about our experiences. It won't be easy, but... I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for years. There's still sadness, still anger, but also... hope? Is that too clich\u00e9 to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Your feelings are valid. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I need some time to process all this. Maybe write some of it down, like you suggested. And then... maybe I'll give my daughter a call. Start that conversation. It's time our story was told.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think it's necessary. For me, for Margaret's memory, for all of us who've faced these challenges. I'm... I'm glad I'm doing this work.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. We'll end here for today. Take care."
