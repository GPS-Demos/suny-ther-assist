    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of the car accident feels so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching tires and smell the burnt rubber. My heart is pounding, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe it's more like... panic? It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? I keep seeing the other car coming towards us, and I feel so helpless. I couldn't do anything to stop it. I... I thought we were going to die.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that feeling of helplessness show up for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like I'm frozen, just like I was in the car. I keep thinking about how I should have done something, anything. Maybe if I had reacted faster, or if I had insisted on driving that day... God, I don't know.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how fragile life is. One moment everything's fine, and the next... it could all be over. It makes me want to hold onto my family tighter, you know? But at the same time, I'm terrified of losing them. I feel like I need to protect them from everything, but I know I can't. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to other parts of your life?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been more cautious since the accident. Not just with driving, but with everything. I'm always looking for potential dangers, always on edge. It's affected my work too. I used to be more confident in my decision-making, but now I second-guess everything. I'm afraid of making a mistake that could hurt someone else.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a little. My shoulders are tense, and I realize I've been clenching my jaw. There's this heaviness in my chest, like I can't take a full breath. It's similar to how I felt right after the accident, but not as intense. It's like my body remembers, even when I try to forget.",
    "Therapist: How do these physical sensations relate to your emotions?",
    "Client: I think... I think they're connected to my fear and anxiety. When I feel the tightness in my chest, it reminds me of the panic I felt during the accident. And the tension in my body, it's like I'm always ready to react, to protect myself. It's exhausting, but I can't seem to relax. I'm always waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's frustrating. I feel angry at myself for not being able to move past this. I want to be the person I was before the accident - carefree, optimistic. But now I feel like I'm constantly on guard. It's affecting my relationships too. My wife says I'm distant, and I know I've been snapping at the kids more often. I hate that this experience is changing who I am.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's some relief in talking about it, like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. But there's also shame. I feel like I should be stronger, you know? Like I should be able to handle this better. I'm a grown man, I've dealt with difficult situations before. Why is this affecting me so much?",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that expectation of yourself?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's not really fair, is it? I mean, I witnessed something traumatic. It's natural to be affected by it. But there's this voice in my head telling me to just get over it, to man up. I think... I think maybe that's part of why I've been struggling. I haven't allowed myself to really process what happened because I've been trying so hard to push it down and move on.",
    "Therapist: How might acknowledging these feelings change things for you?",
    "Client: That's... that's a good question. I think maybe it would take some of the pressure off. If I allow myself to feel these emotions, to really sit with them, maybe they won't have such a strong hold on me. It's scary though. I'm afraid if I let myself feel everything, it might overwhelm me. But... but maybe that's what I need to do to start healing.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to face these feelings?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be more open with my wife about what I'm going through. She's been so patient, but I've been pushing her away. And maybe... maybe I need to consider talking to someone professionally, outside of these sessions. It's hard for me to admit I need help, but I'm starting to see that trying to handle this all on my own isn't working.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that need?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. Like a weight's been lifted. I've been carrying this all by myself for so long, thinking I had to be strong for everyone else. But admitting I need support doesn't make me weak, does it? It's... it's okay to need help sometimes. I think... I think I'm ready to start really dealing with this, instead of just trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll talk to my wife tonight. Really talk to her, you know? Tell her about how I've been feeling, about the fears and the anxiety. And maybe... maybe we could look into some family counseling too. I want to be there for my kids, to help them process this as well. It's a scary step, but I think it's the right one.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've finally started to unpack some of this stuff I've been carrying around. It was hard, reliving that memory, but I think it was important. I feel like I understand myself a little better now, and I have some direction on where to go from here. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm looking forward to it. It's still scary, but I feel like I'm finally moving in the right direction. I appreciate your help and support through all of this. See you next week."
