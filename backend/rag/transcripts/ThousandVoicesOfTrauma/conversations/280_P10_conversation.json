    "Therapist: Good afternoon, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my military experiences today, and that's always tough.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start by getting comfortable. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us back to that day in Afghanistan.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Right. It's... it's hot. Unbearably hot. The sun's beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. We're on patrol in Helmand Province. The air is thick with dust, and there's this... this constant tension. Like a rubber band stretched to its limit.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see my squad. We're moving through a small village. Mud-brick houses, narrow alleys. There are children peeking out from doorways, but the adults... they look wary. Suspicious. I'm gripping my rifle tightly, scanning rooftops, windows. Every shadow could be a threat.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 5. I'm tense, but... but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: We're approaching a marketplace. It's eerily quiet. Usually, these places are bustling, but today... it's like everyone's holding their breath. I can smell spices and... and something rotting. Probably meat left out in the heat. Suddenly, I hear a shout from up ahead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) There's... there's a man. He's running towards us, shouting something I can't understand. His hands... I can't see his hands. My squadmate yells, \"Gun!\" and I... I raise my rifle. It all happens so fast.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Rahul. You're safe here. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart's pounding. I can taste metal in my mouth. My finger's on the trigger, and I... (pauses, breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: (Nods) Yes, I... I can feel it.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: (Swallows hard) The man... he keeps coming. I'm yelling at him to stop, but he doesn't. Or can't. And then... and then I pull the trigger. The sound is deafening. He falls, and there's... there's blood. So much blood. And then I see it... in his hand. It's not a gun. It's... it's just a piece of paper. (Starts to cry)",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Rahul. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Through tears) Everything's chaos. People are screaming. My squadmates are securing the area. I... I can't move. I'm just staring at him. He's not much older than me. And I... I killed him. Oh God, I killed him.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Where are you now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still there. In the marketplace. The smell of gunpowder mixes with the spices. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening.\" I feel sick. Disgusted with myself. I want to help him, but I know it's too late. I've taken a life, and I can never take that back.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Rahul, I want you to focus on my voice. You're here, in this room. You're safe. Take a deep breath in... and out. Can you do that for me?",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Y-yes. I'm... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you tell me three things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the painting on the wall. The green plant in the corner. And... and your desk.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, when you're ready, let's go back to that moment. What happens after the shooting?",
    "Client: (Sighs) We... we secure the area. Someone checks the man's body. They find ID on him. He was... he was just trying to deliver a message to us. A warning about IEDs in the area. He was trying to help us, and I... I killed him.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And shame. I feel like... like I'm the monster we were supposed to be fighting. I can't look at my squadmates. I can't look at myself.",
    "Therapist: What happens next, Rahul?",
    "Client: We... we have to continue the patrol. But I'm not really there anymore. I'm just going through the motions. My body's moving, but my mind... my mind is still back there, with that man. With what I did.",
    "Therapist: How does the rest of the day unfold?",
    "Client: It's a blur. We finish the patrol. No one talks much. Back at base, I have to give a report. I feel like I'm outside my body, watching myself speak. The words come out, but they don't feel like mine. That night... that night, I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Rahul. Can you tell me about the days that followed?",
    "Client: They were... they were hard. I couldn't eat. Couldn't sleep. I kept replaying that moment over and over in my head. Wondering what I could have done differently. My squadmates tried to talk to me, tell me it wasn't my fault, but... but I couldn't hear them. All I could hear was that gunshot, over and over.",
    "Therapist: How did this event impact you in the long term?",
    "Client: It... it changed everything. I couldn't trust myself anymore. Every decision, every action... I second-guessed everything. I became hyper-vigilant, always on edge. And the guilt... the guilt never really went away. It's always there, just under the surface.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Rahul. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few deep breaths together. In... and out.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply)",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Rahul. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: It was... it was tough. Really tough. But I think... I think it was important. To face it, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I just... I hope that someday I can forgive myself. That man... he had a family too. I think about them a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural and compassionate response, Rahul. We'll continue to work on processing these feelings. For now, let's focus on grounding ourselves. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Yes, I see... the clock on the wall, your bookshelf, the window, the plant, and the painting.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. And four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my watch, my shirt, and the floor beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, a car outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The leather of the chair and... is that coffee?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... just the dryness in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Thank you, Rahul. You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But I feel a bit more... I don't know, grounded? Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step, Rahul. Remember to be kind to yourself this evening. Do you have any questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Rahul. I'm proud of the work you've done today. We'll continue to process this in our future sessions. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
