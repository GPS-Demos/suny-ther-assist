    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you start by describing the cyber bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It started when I got back from my deployment. I was struggling to adjust to civilian life, and I thought connecting with old friends online might help. But when I posted about my experiences, someone I thought was a friend started mocking me. They said I was weak for having PTSD and that I should've stayed in the war zone if I couldn't handle being home. It felt like a punch to the gut.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: Their comments got worse. They started sharing private things I'd told them in confidence about my struggles. Other people joined in, calling me names and saying I was just seeking attention. I felt so exposed and betrayed. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw their cruel messages. It was like being back in the war zone, but instead of physical threats, it was emotional warfare. I felt so alone and misunderstood. The worst part was when they started photoshopping images of me in distressing situations and sharing them. I... I'm sorry, I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about. The images they created... they mixed my worst war memories with their taunts. I saw myself in situations that never happened, but they felt so real. I started questioning my own memories. Was I really as weak as they said? Did I deserve this treatment? I spiraled into a deep depression.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I felt worthless. Everything I'd been through, everything I'd fought for, seemed meaningless in the face of their cruelty. I started isolating myself even more. I was afraid to go online, afraid to reach out to anyone. The cyber bullying brought back all the helplessness I felt during the war, but this time I didn't have my unit to support me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I considered... ending it all. The pain was too much. But then I thought about my fellow soldiers who didn't make it back. I felt like I owed it to them to keep fighting. So I decided to seek help. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, even harder than combat. Admitting I needed help felt like proving the bullies right, but I knew I had to do it to survive.",
    "Therapist: You showed immense strength. How do you feel now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but not as overwhelming as before. Talking about it makes it feel more manageable. I'm angry at the bullies, but I'm also proud of myself for getting help. I just wish I could shake this feeling of vulnerability. Every time I get a notification on my phone, I flinch, wondering if it's happening again.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to remind myself that their words don't define me. My experiences in the war were real, and my struggles are valid. I'm learning to be kinder to myself, but it's a daily battle. Sometimes I still hear their taunts in my head, but I'm getting better at challenging those thoughts.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic. There are good days and bad days. On good days, I can see how far I've come. I've reconnected with some trusted friends and even started a support group for other veterans who've experienced cyber bullying. On bad days, the memories still feel fresh, but I'm getting better at using the coping strategies we've discussed.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am, most of the time. But sometimes I still wonder why they targeted me. Was there something I could have done differently? I know rationally that it wasn't my fault, but emotionally, I still struggle with self-blame. It's hard to reconcile the person I was before the war, the soldier I became, and the person I am now after all this.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those questions. You're processing complex experiences.",
    "Client: You're right. I'm trying to integrate all these parts of myself. The war changed me, and the cyber bullying changed me again. But I'm starting to see that change doesn't have to be negative. I'm stronger now, more empathetic. I understand pain in a way I never did before, and that's made me a better friend and advocate for others.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that growth?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating. Like I'm reclaiming my narrative. The bullies tried to write my story for me, but I'm taking it back. I'm not just a victim of war or cyber bullying. I'm a survivor, a fighter. And maybe, just maybe, all of this will help me make a difference for someone else someday.",
    "Therapist: You've made remarkable progress. Our time is almost up. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something heavy I've been carrying. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's still painful, but I feel more in control now. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful about the future.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
