    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cyber bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It started when I posted a picture of myself on Instagram. I was feeling good that day, you know? But then the comments started coming in. At first, I didn't think much of it, but they kept getting worse. People were calling me names, saying I was ugly, that I should kill myself. It was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The comments kept coming, and I started to feel sick to my stomach. I wanted to delete the post, but I felt frozen. Then someone from my class shared the post in a group chat, and more people joined in. They were making memes of my picture, distorting it, and adding horrible captions. I felt so exposed and humiliated.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember shaking as I scrolled through the comments. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I kept thinking about how everyone at school would see this, how they'd look at me. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those comments, those distorted images. The next day at school was terrible. People were whispering and laughing when I walked by. Some even shouted the insults from the comments at me in the hallway. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I started having panic attacks. Every time my phone buzzed, I'd jump. I was terrified of what new horrible thing might be waiting for me. I stopped going to classes, stopped eating properly. I felt like my whole world was crumbling around me, and I didn't know how to make it stop.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I had no control. These people I barely knew had so much power over me. They were destroying my self-esteem, my sense of safety, everything. I started to believe the things they were saying about me. I felt worthless, like maybe they were right, and I didn't deserve to be here.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel that panic again. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I'm facing it instead of running away. It still hurts, but maybe not as much as before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's still painful to remember, but I think I understand now that what they did says more about them than about me. I'm starting to see that I didn't deserve any of that. It's a process, but I think I'm slowly healing.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can get through this. Talking about it, facing it head-on... it's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something heavy I've been carrying around. There's still fear and pain, but also a glimmer of hope. I think I'm ready to start reclaiming my life from this experience.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done."
