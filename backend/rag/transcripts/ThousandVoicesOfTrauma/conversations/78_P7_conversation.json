    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the workplace incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a normal day at the office, everything seemed fine. I was at my desk, working on some reports when suddenly I heard shouting coming from the break room. At first, I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just a heated discussion, but then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The shouting got louder, and I heard a crash. I stood up, feeling my heart racing. As I approached the break room, I saw my coworker, Mike, throwing things at our manager, Sarah. She was cowering in the corner, trying to protect herself. I froze, I couldn't believe what I was seeing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. My hands were shaking, and I couldn't move. I wanted to help Sarah, but I was paralyzed with fear. Mike was screaming about being fired, and Sarah was pleading with him to calm down. I could see the fear in her eyes, and it mirrored my own...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I finally managed to step back and run to my desk. I called security, but my voice was trembling so much I could barely speak. I kept looking at the break room, hearing the commotion. It felt like an eternity before security arrived. When they did, Mike had Sarah by her collar, shoving her against the wall. I saw her glasses on the floor, broken...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I can't get the image out of my head. Sarah's face, the fear, the helplessness. And Mike... he looked like a completely different person. After security took him away, Sarah was sobbing. I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn't move. I just stood there, useless...",
    "Therapist: You weren't useless. You called for help.",
    "Client: I guess... but I feel like I should have done more. The office was in chaos after that. People were crying, hugging each other. I just sat at my desk, numb. I couldn't process what had happened. For weeks after, every time I walked past the break room, I'd have this surge of panic...",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. I feel a knot in my stomach, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm back there, watching it all happen again. I keep thinking, what if Mike had turned on me? What if security hadn't come in time?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) It's hard to believe that. Even now, at my new job, I'm always on edge. I check for the nearest exit wherever I go. I can't concentrate if I hear raised voices. It's like I'm constantly waiting for something terrible to happen...",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you... It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I just want to feel normal again, you know? To go to work without feeling this constant fear and anxiety. To stop having nightmares about what happened, or what could have happened...",
    "Therapist: We'll work through this together. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's exhausting living like this. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel safe in a workplace again. But being here, talking about it... it feels like a step in the right direction. It's still painful and scary, but maybe a little less so each time...",
    "Therapist: That's right. Small steps. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I think. My heart rate is slowing down a bit. I feel drained, but also a little lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying around. It's still there, but the weight feels a bit less crushing. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, eventually, I can move past this and not let it control my life anymore. It's a small feeling, but it's there...",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today."
