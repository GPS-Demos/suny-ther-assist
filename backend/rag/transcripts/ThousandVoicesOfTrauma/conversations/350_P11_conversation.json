    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always intense to go back there, you know? The memory of that airplane crash... it just brings up so much. I can still hear the screams, feel the panic in the air. It's like I'm right back in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The smell. I don't think I've ever focused on that before, but today... the smell of smoke and fuel was so vivid. It made my stomach churn. And then there was this moment of silence right before everything went chaos. That silence... it was deafening.",
    "Therapist: How did experiencing those sensations affect you?",
    "Client: It... it brought me right back there. My heart started racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. For a moment, I thought I couldn't breathe. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to understand that.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit calmer, I suppose. Still shaky, but... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I made it through again. Each time feels like a small victory, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm less jumpy when I hear loud noises now. Before, any sudden sound would send me into a panic. Now, I can remind myself that I'm safe. It's still hard, but... I'm getting there.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's helping you most?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises, definitely. And... talking about it here. It's like each time I face it, it loses a bit of its power over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still terrifying, but... I feel like I'm slowly regaining control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I... I've been able to think about the future more. Before, it was like I was stuck in that moment. Now, I can imagine things getting better. I'm even considering taking a short flight to visit my sister. That felt impossible before.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: Scared, definitely. But also... hopeful? It's like there's a part of me that's starting to believe I can move past this. That I'm not defined by what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. What's your next goal?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try watching a movie with an airplane scene. It sounds small, but it feels like a manageable next step. And maybe it'll help me feel more prepared for an actual flight.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. How can you prepare for that?",
    "Client: I'll probably use the breathing techniques we've practiced. And maybe I'll have someone with me for support. Oh, and I'll remind myself that it's just a movie, not reality. That's something I've learned here - to distinguish between memory and present.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: Drained, but... good. It's always tough, but I feel like I'm making progress. These sessions... they're hard, but they're giving me hope. I'm starting to see a future beyond the trauma, and that's... that's everything.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could delve into how this trauma has affected my relationships? I've been keeping people at arm's length, and I'd like to work on that.",
    "Therapist: That's a great topic. We'll explore that next session. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park. Being in nature always helps ground me after these sessions. And I'll call my sister - connecting with her always makes me feel better.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but... I'm glad I'm doing this. I'm starting to feel like myself again, bit by bit. It's a long road, but I'm on it, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your progress is commendable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. This... it means a lot."
