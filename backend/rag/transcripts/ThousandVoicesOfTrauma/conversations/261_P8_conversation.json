    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in the car, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to have caught up with that fact yet.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during the accident. It's like... I was just a passenger in my own life, you know? I couldn't control anything. And then I start wondering, what if it happens again? What if next time I'm not so lucky? It's... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that feeling of helplessness sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's really uncomfortable. I've always prided myself on being in control, on being the one who takes care of things. But in that moment, and even now sometimes, I feel like I have no control at all. It makes me angry, actually. Angry at myself for not being able to do anything, angry at the situation, just... angry.",
    "Therapist: Anger is a common response. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of fear. Not just about driving, but about life in general. It's like... the accident showed me how fragile everything is. One moment you're fine, and the next... everything can change. I find myself constantly on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does this fear affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty pervasive. I've been avoiding driving as much as possible. When I do drive, I'm hyper-vigilant, constantly scanning for potential dangers. It's hard to relax, even when I'm just sitting at home. I keep thinking about my late wife, too. About how she'd handle this if she were still here. I miss her support... her calming presence.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What do you do to cope?",
    "Client: I... I try to keep busy. Work helps, it gives me something to focus on. But sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know? Like I'm not really living, just... existing. I've been trying some breathing exercises, like you suggested. They help a bit, but it's hard to stick with them when the anxiety gets really bad.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How do you feel your coping strategies are working for you?",
    "Client: They're... they're okay, I guess. But I still feel like I'm not making enough progress. I want to feel normal again, to be able to drive without panicking, to not constantly worry about every little thing. It's frustrating because I know, logically, that I'm safe most of the time. But my body and my emotions don't seem to get the message.",
    "Therapist: What would \"feeling normal\" look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I guess it would mean being able to go about my day without this constant undercurrent of fear. To be able to drive without white-knuckling the steering wheel. To be able to enjoy things again, you know? I used to love traveling, trying new restaurants. Now, the thought of doing those things just makes me anxious. I want to feel... I don't know, lighter? Less burdened by all this.",
    "Therapist: That's a clear goal. How do you think today's session has moved you towards that?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to say. On one hand, I feel drained from reliving the accident. But on the other, there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I faced this memory head-on and I'm still here. I'm still functioning. Maybe that's progress? I don't know. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: Confusion is normal. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... well, as scary as it was to relive the accident, I got through it. And maybe... maybe that means I'm stronger than I give myself credit for? I don't know. It's like there's a part of me that wants to believe I can get better, but another part that's scared to hope. What if I can't? What if this is just... how I am now?",
    "Therapist: How does that uncertainty feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. But also... maybe a little exciting? I mean, if there's a chance I could feel better, really better... that's something, right? I just... I wish I knew for sure. I wish I could fast-forward and see if all this work pays off. But I guess that's not how it works, is it?",
    "Therapist: No, it's not. How do you feel about continuing this process?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous about it, to be honest. It's hard, facing all these memories and feelings. But I also know that I can't keep living like this. I want to get better. I want to be able to enjoy life again, to not be constantly afraid. So... I guess I'm willing to keep trying. It's just... it's a lot, you know?",
    "Therapist: It is a lot. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I think just knowing that I have these sessions, that I have somewhere to process all of this, helps. Maybe... maybe some more techniques for managing the anxiety when it gets really bad? And... I don't know, maybe some way to remind myself that I'm making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it? It's easy to lose sight of that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Those are great ideas. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling pretty drained, but... also kind of hopeful? Is that weird? To feel both at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's very common. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to do one of those grounding exercises we've practiced. Just to help me transition back to the rest of my day. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
