    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what you're seeing?",
    "Client: I... I'm back in our old house. I can see the peeling wallpaper in the living room. The air feels heavy, and there's a smell of stale cigarettes. I can hear raised voices coming from the kitchen. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: My father is yelling. I can't make out the words, but his voice is so angry. I'm hiding behind the couch, trying to make myself as small as possible. There's a crash \u2013 I think he's thrown something. My mother is crying. I'm so scared...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I can hear footsteps \u2013 heavy, stumbling. He's coming into the living room. I'm holding my breath, praying he doesn't see me. The floorboards creak under his weight...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's muttering to himself, swearing. I can smell the alcohol on him from here. Suddenly, he spots me. His eyes... they're so full of rage. He's coming towards me, and I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: He grabs my arm, pulling me out from behind the couch. It hurts so much. I'm crying now, begging him to let go. My mother is in the doorway, pleading with him to stop. He pushes her aside, and she falls. I can't bear to see her like that...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, it's just a memory.",
    "Client: I close my eyes, wishing I could disappear. I can hear my mother sobbing, the sound of her trying to get up. My father is shaking me, shouting in my face. The smell of alcohol is overwhelming. I feel so helpless, so small...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I manage to wrench my arm free and run to my mother. We hold each other, both of us shaking. My father is still yelling, but he seems to lose interest. He stumbles back to the kitchen, probably for another drink. I can feel my mother's tears on my cheek, mixing with my own...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is still racing, and I can feel tears on my face. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've let out something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown great strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I think it helps. I've never really described that scene in such detail before. It's like I can still feel the fear, the helplessness... but I also feel a bit stronger now, knowing I can face these memories.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My body feels tense, especially my shoulders and jaw. I'm a bit shaky, and my breathing is faster than usual. But I also feel... lighter somehow? Like a weight has been lifted, even if it's just a little bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Take a deep breath for me.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay, that helps. My heart rate is slowing down now. I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you, rather than back in that memory. It's strange how vivid it all was, like I was reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I was worried I wouldn't be able to do this, but I'm glad I did. It's hard, but I think it's helping me understand my anxiety better. I can see how these experiences have shaped me. I just hope I can continue to face them and maybe... maybe start to heal.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress. How about we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel emotionally drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit empowered? Like I've confronted something I've been running from for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy, but I'm starting to believe that maybe I can get through this, that maybe I can find a way to live with these memories without them controlling me.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. We'll continue next time."
