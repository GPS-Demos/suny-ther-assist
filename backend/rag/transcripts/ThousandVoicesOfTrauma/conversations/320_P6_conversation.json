    "Therapist: Okay, John. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm there. I'm walking down the street, it's a sunny afternoon. I can hear traffic and people talking. Then suddenly, there's a screeching sound. I turn and see two cars colliding at the intersection. It's so loud, like metal grinding against metal. I freeze, my heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The cars are spinning, and one of them is heading towards the sidewalk. People are screaming and running. I can't move. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't breathe. The car hits a lamppost just a few feet away from me. The sound is deafening.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see the driver of the car that hit the lamppost. He's not moving. There's blood on the windshield. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear. People are rushing to help, calling for ambulances. I feel so useless, just standing there.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel sick to my stomach remembering this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I finally manage to move. I walk closer to the accident. The smell of gasoline and burned rubber is overwhelming. I can hear someone crying in one of the cars. It's a child. That's when I really start to panic. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: I see paramedics arriving. They're working on the driver who isn't moving. Someone is comforting the child. I feel so helpless and guilty for not doing anything. My legs are shaky, and I have to sit down on the curb. I can't stop staring at the scene.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're processing this memory. Keep going.",

    "Client: Okay... I'm starting to feel a little calmer now. My heart isn't racing as much.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, open your eyes.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright, I'm back. That was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but also a little relieved. It's like some of the weight has lifted.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. We'll process this more in our next session."
