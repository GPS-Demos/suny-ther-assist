    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of witnessing that violence... it's still so vivid. I can feel my heart racing even now.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The screams. I keep hearing them echoing in my head. It's like... like I'm right back there again. And the helplessness. I couldn't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: That must be overwhelming. How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. I wanted to run away, to be honest. But I also felt... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit stronger? Like I could face it for a moment without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: I see. You showed a lot of courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It doesn't feel like courage, though. I still feel so... broken. Like this trauma has taken over my life. My business is suffering, my relationship with my wife is strained. I just can't seem to shake this off.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this connects to your daily struggles?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. It's exhausting. And then there's the guilt. I survived, but others didn't. Sometimes I wonder why I'm even here.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. What helps you keep going?",
    "Client: My family, I suppose. My kids. They need me. And... maybe a small part of me that hopes things can get better. But it's hard to believe that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Hope is powerful. How might today's session contribute to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I... I faced the memory. That's something, right? Maybe if I can do it here, I can start facing other things too. It's just... it's so hard to let my guard down.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I could... maybe try to be more present with my family? Instead of always being lost in my thoughts or work. It's scary, but... they deserve that.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: Terrified, to be honest. But... also a little hopeful? If that makes sense. It's painful, but maybe it's necessary. I just... I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is remarkable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I... I think I need this. Even if it's difficult. Thank you for... for helping me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your hard work is paying off. See you next week."
