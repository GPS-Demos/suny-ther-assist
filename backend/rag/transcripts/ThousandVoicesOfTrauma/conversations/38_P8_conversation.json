    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I can still see it all happening in front of me, you know? The shouting, the sound of glass breaking... I feel kind of shaky.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are trembling, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I keep clenching my jaw, too. It's like my body is still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, why didn't I do something? Why didn't I try to stop it? But then I remember I was just a kid. I couldn't have... I mean, what could I have done? But there's still this voice in my head saying I should have been braver, stronger.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you now?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... I don't know, inadequate? Like I'm always falling short. Even at work, when I make a small mistake, it's like I'm that scared little girl again, feeling useless and weak. It's frustrating because logically, I know it's not true, but emotionally... it's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: Anger, definitely. I'm angry at him for putting us through that. But I'm also angry at myself for still letting it affect me. There's sadness too, like a deep ache in my chest. And shame... I feel so much shame, even though I know it wasn't my fault. It's like this heavy blanket weighing me down.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions manifest in your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they kind of color everything, I guess. The anger makes me defensive sometimes, especially with my boyfriend. I snap at him for no reason, then feel terrible about it. The sadness... it's always there in the background, making everything feel a bit gray. And the shame, it makes it hard to connect with people. I'm always worried they'll see through me and realize how broken I am inside.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"broken\"?",
    "Client: It's like... I feel damaged, you know? Like there's this fundamental flaw in me that everyone will eventually see. I put on a brave face at work, with friends, but inside, I'm constantly second-guessing myself. I worry that I'm not good enough, that I'll never measure up. It's exhausting, always trying to prove to myself and others that I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory affect those feelings?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. On one hand, it brings all those feelings of helplessness and fear right back to the surface. But on the other hand, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I survived that. I'm here, talking about it. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: What does that strength mean to you?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about it that way before. I guess it means I'm more resilient than I give myself credit for. Maybe I'm not as broken as I thought. It's just... it's hard to hold onto that feeling. It's easier to fall back into seeing myself as weak.",
    "Therapist: What would it be like to embrace that strength more?",
    "Client: It's scary, to be honest. If I'm not the \"broken\" person, then who am I? But... it's also kind of exciting. Like maybe I could start standing up for myself more, or taking more risks at work. Maybe I could stop apologizing for everything all the time. It's just... it's a big shift in how I see myself.",
    "Therapist: How does this new perspective relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it could be a turning point. If I can start seeing myself as a survivor rather than a victim, maybe I can stop letting the past control my present so much. It's not going to be easy, and I know I'll still have bad days, but... maybe there's hope for me to have a life that isn't defined by what happened.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider this possibility?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's excitement, like I mentioned before. But there's also fear. What if I try to change and fail? What if I can't live up to this new image of myself? And there's a bit of sadness too, like I'm saying goodbye to a part of myself that I've known for so long. It's familiar, even if it's painful. But underneath all that, there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe pride? Like, maybe I'm stronger than I thought, and that's pretty cool.",
    "Therapist: How can you nurture that spark moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could start by challenging some of those negative thoughts when they come up? Like, when I start feeling inadequate at work, I could try to remind myself of times I've succeeded. Or maybe I could start a journal, writing down moments when I feel strong or brave, even if they're small. And... I think I need to be kinder to myself. Give myself permission to make mistakes without seeing it as a reflection of my worth. It's going to be hard, but... I think I want to try.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need in this process?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be more open with the people close to me. My boyfriend, my parents - they don't really know how much I struggle with this. Maybe if I let them in a bit more, they could help remind me of my strength when I forget. And... I think these sessions are really important. Having a safe space to process all of this, to challenge those old beliefs... it's scary, but it's also helping. I just... I hope I can keep this momentum going, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been... intense. Draining, but in a good way, I think. Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. I feel raw, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I'm also kind of looking forward to it. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how I can build on this new perspective. Maybe we could talk about specific strategies for challenging those negative thoughts? And... I think I want to work on opening up to my boyfriend. That feels scary, but important. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but okay. A bit shaky still, but not as much as before. And there's this little glimmer of hope that wasn't there at the start of the session. Thank you for... for helping me see things differently. I know we have a long way to go, but... I think I'm ready to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next time."
