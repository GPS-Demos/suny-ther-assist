    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a severe earthquake. I was in my apartment when it started. The ground was shaking so violently, I could barely stand. I remember the sound of glass breaking and things falling off shelves. I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: I saw cracks forming in the walls, and the ceiling was making this awful creaking noise. I thought the whole building might collapse. I tried to get to the doorway, but I kept stumbling. My heart was racing, and I couldn't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the power went out, and suddenly everything was dark. I could hear people screaming outside. I felt so helpless and alone. I wanted to run, but I was frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to last forever. When it finally stopped, I was shaking uncontrollably. I managed to grab my phone and call my partner, but the lines were jammed. I felt so isolated and scared. I didn't know if anyone I cared about was okay.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's still hard to think about. After the main quake, there were aftershocks. Each one made me jump and panic all over again. I kept thinking, \"What if this one's worse? What if the building collapses this time?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you cope with those thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I tried to focus on my breathing, like we've practiced. But it was so hard. My mind kept racing, thinking about worst-case scenarios. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're showing strength by facing this memory.",
    "Client: Thanks. It helps to hear that. After a while, I managed to leave the apartment. The streets were chaos. There was debris everywhere, car alarms going off, people crying and shouting. It felt surreal, like I was in a movie.",
    "Therapist: You're describing it vividly. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing a bit, and my palms are sweaty. But I'm okay. It's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're making progress. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. I spent the next few hours wandering around, trying to find somewhere safe. I ended up in a makeshift shelter in a park. There were so many people there, all looking shocked and lost. I remember feeling a strange mix of relief that I wasn't alone, but also guilt that I was relatively unharmed when others were injured.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have conflicting emotions in such situations.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. The worst part was not knowing what was going to happen next. Would there be more quakes? Was my family okay? When could I go home? The uncertainty was almost worse than the earthquake itself.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How do you feel about discussing it now?",
    "Client: It's still difficult, but not as bad as I expected. Talking about it makes it feel less like this huge, scary thing in my mind. It's just... a thing that happened, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thanks. I think what stuck with me most was the feeling of powerlessness. Nature just reminded us how small and vulnerable we are. It took me a long time to feel safe in my own home again after that.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You've shown resilience.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Looking back, I can see how far I've come. I still get anxious sometimes during small tremors, but it's not debilitating like it used to be. Talking about it like this... it helps put things in perspective.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... okay. A bit drained, but also somewhat relieved. It's like I've been carrying this heavy weight, and now it's a little lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common and positive reaction. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... I feel like I'm getting stronger. Like maybe one day, this won't have such a hold on me.",
    "Therapist: That's a great outlook. We'll end here for today. Well done."
