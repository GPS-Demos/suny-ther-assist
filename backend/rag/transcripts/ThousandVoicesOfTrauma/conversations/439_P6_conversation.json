    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the dusty streets of Kabul. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. There's tension in the air, like everyone's holding their breath.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4. I'm nervous, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going with the memory.",
    "Client: We're on patrol. I can hear the crunch of gravel under our boots. Suddenly, there's a loud explosion nearby. My heart starts racing, and I can taste metal in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking, and my chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see people running, screaming. There's smoke everywhere. I'm frozen, I can't move. My squadmate is yelling at me, but I can't understand what he's saying. Everything seems muffled, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I... I can't do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Remember, you're here now, safe in this room. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay... I... I see bodies on the ground. There's blood everywhere. I smell smoke and... and something burning. I think it's... oh god, I think it's flesh.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally snap out of it. I start moving, helping the injured. But there's so many... so much blood. I can't save them all.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Guilty. So, so guilty. My SUDS is still at 9.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're evacuating the area. I'm helping carry a wounded civilian. His blood is soaking through my uniform. I can feel its warmth on my skin. I... I don't know if he'll make it.",
    "Therapist: And now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe an 8? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. What else do you remember?",

    "Client: *opens eyes, takes a deep breath* That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. My SUDS is down to a 4.",
