    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Just focus on the memory and describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. We're on patrol, walking through a small village. The streets are eerily quiet. I'm gripping my rifle tightly, my eyes darting from window to window, rooftop to rooftop.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 4. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. My ears are ringing, and dust is everywhere. I can't see clearly, but I hear screaming. My heart is racing, and I'm struggling to breathe. I'm frozen for a moment, unsure what to do.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's jumped to a 7. My palms are sweating, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: I force myself to move, ducking behind a low wall. I'm trying to locate my team, but the smoke is thick. I can hear gunfire now, coming from multiple directions. I'm scared, really scared. I don't know if my friends are okay or if I'm about to be shot.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I'm back there. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: I spot one of my teammates. He's down, not moving. I want to help him, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear. I feel so ashamed. I should be helping him, but I can't make my body respond. The gunfire is getting closer.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel sick to my stomach. My head is pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. This feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying to calm down. The memory is still there, but I'm trying to remind myself I'm not actually there.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Do you want to continue or take a break?",
    "Client: I think I can continue. In the memory, I finally force myself to move. I crawl towards my teammate, staying low. The gunfire is constant now. I reach him and check for a pulse. He's alive, but unconscious. I start dragging him behind cover, my arms burning with the effort.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's intense, but I feel a little better. Maybe a 6? I'm proud I managed to help him in the end.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You showed courage in a terrifying situation.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I did. As I'm dragging him, more of our team arrives. They provide cover fire while I get my friend to safety. It's chaos, but we're working together. Eventually, we manage to evacuate. As we're leaving, I can see the village in ruins. I feel a mix of relief, guilt, and exhaustion.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's back down to a 4. I'm drained, but I feel like I've processed some of it.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... better, I think. It was tough, but I feel like I faced it head-on this time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take some time to debrief and relax before we end our session."
