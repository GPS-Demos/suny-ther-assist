    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Martinez. Part of me wants to do this, but I'm also feeling... I don't know, maybe a little apprehensive? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself to that memory we discussed?",
    "Client: Okay... (deep breath) I'm closing my eyes now. I can... I can see the playground. It's a sunny day, but I don't feel warm. I feel cold inside.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are other kids playing, laughing. But I'm alone on the swing. I'm... I'm eight years old. My dress is blue with white flowers. I can hear them... some older boys approaching.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're coming closer. I can hear them laughing, but it's not a nice laugh. One of them, the tallest one, he's pointing at me. He's saying... he's saying, \"Look at the little beaner girl. Bet she can't even speak English.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Maria? On a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I... I'd say about 60. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The boys, they're surrounding the swing now. One of them grabs the chain, stopping me. He's leaning in close, I can smell the bubblegum on his breath. He's saying, \"Why don't you go back to where you came from?\" I... I want to say something, but my throat feels tight. I can't speak.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Stay with the memory. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel so small. So powerless. My stomach is in knots. I want to run, but I'm frozen. I can feel tears starting to form in my eyes, but I'm trying so hard not to cry in front of them.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. My hands are shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take another deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in the present. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... The boys are laughing now. One of them starts pushing the swing, hard. I'm gripping the chains so tight my knuckles are white. I'm scared I'll fall off. They're chanting now, \"Go home, go home!\" I close my eyes, wishing I could disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear a voice. It's Ms. Rodriguez, my teacher. She's yelling at the boys to stop. They scatter, running away. Ms. Rodriguez comes to me, asks if I'm okay. But I can't speak. I just nod, even though I'm not okay. I'm not okay at all.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) Okay... I think I'm calming down a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue with the memory.",
    "Client: Ms. Rodriguez is kneeling in front of me now. She's speaking softly, telling me it's not my fault. But I don't believe her. I feel... I feel like it is my fault. Like if I wasn't different, if my skin wasn't brown, if my name wasn't Maria... maybe they wouldn't have done this.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 80. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can still hear their laughter, their taunts. I... I remember going home that day. I didn't tell my parents what happened. I was too ashamed. I just went to my room and cried into my pillow.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt... I felt like I didn't belong. Like I was an outsider in my own country. I was born here, but in that moment, I felt like an alien. I wanted to scrub my skin clean, to change who I was.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult for you.",
    "Client: It was. It... it still is. Even now, decades later, I can feel that same pain, that same shame. It's like... it's like it never really went away.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by facing this memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little relieved? Like I've been carrying this for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Maria. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I'm opening my eyes now. The room... it looks brighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now that we've completed this exercise?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time. It still hurts, but maybe... maybe it's a step towards healing?",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight, Maria. This is indeed a step towards healing. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment of quiet. To process everything we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few minutes of silence. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your bravery today, Maria. How are you feeling as we end our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I'm feeling okay. Tired, but okay. Thank you, Dr. Martinez. I know this isn't easy, but I think... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. We'll continue to work through this together. Take care of yourself this week, and I'll see you at our next session.",
