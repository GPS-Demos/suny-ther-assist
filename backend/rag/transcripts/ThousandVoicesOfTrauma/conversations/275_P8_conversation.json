    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit. That memory of the flood, it just... it brings everything back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's most vivid for you right now?",
    "Client: The sound. The roaring of the water. It's like it's still in my ears. And the smell... that damp, earthy smell mixed with something else. Something... I don't know, chemical maybe? It's hard to describe, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: I see. What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about my neighbors, the ones who didn't make it. I... I should have done more to help them.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a weight in my stomach. Heavy. Makes me feel sick. And my chest feels tight, like I can't get a full breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. What thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I... I keep hearing their voices. Screaming for help. And I think, \"Why them and not me?\" It doesn't make sense. I mean, I know logically it's not my fault, but... it feels like it is.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your overall experience of the trauma?",
    "Client: I guess... it's always there, you know? Even when I'm not thinking about it directly. It's like this undercurrent in my life. And then something will trigger it - a heavy rain, or even just the sound of running water sometimes - and suddenly I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to share these feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like, I've been carrying this around for so long, and now it's out there. It doesn't make it go away, but... maybe it makes it a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: I'm hearing a mix of difficulty and relief. Can you say more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... complicated. On one hand, talking about it brings everything back. The fear, the guilt, the helplessness. But on the other hand, it's like... I'm not alone with it anymore. Someone else knows. And maybe... maybe that makes it a little less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: Back then, it was all consuming. I couldn't think about anything else. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, thinking I heard the water coming. Now... it's still there, but it's not everything. I can go days without thinking about it sometimes. But then when it hits, it hits hard.",
    "Therapist: What helps you in those moments when it hits hard?",
    "Client: I try to ground myself. Focus on what's real and present. Sometimes I'll call my wife, just to hear her voice. Or I'll go for a walk, feel the ground under my feet. It doesn't always work, but... it helps.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in therapy so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's been a journey. Some days I feel like I'm making real progress, you know? Like I'm getting my life back. Other days... it feels like I'm right back where I started. But overall, I think I'm moving forward. Slowly, but... forward.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery process?",
    "Client: I think... seeing small changes. Like, I can watch the weather channel now without having a panic attack. That's new. And... my relationship with my wife. We're closer now. She understands more of what I'm going through. And my kids... I want to be better for them. I want to be present, not always caught up in the past.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your view of yourself?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. In some ways, I feel weaker. Like I'm not the strong, capable person I thought I was. But in other ways... I don't know. Maybe I'm stronger? I've been through something terrible and I'm still here, still trying. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could talk more about the guilt? It's still... it's still really heavy. And I'd like to find ways to manage it better. Maybe... maybe even start to let some of it go?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but... for now, it's nice to have a break from it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I'll try. It's not easy, but... I'm learning. Thank you for listening. For... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
