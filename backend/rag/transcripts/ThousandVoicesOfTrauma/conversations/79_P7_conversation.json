    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some difficult things today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just... thinking about those times with my ex-husband, it brings up so many emotions.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Let's focus on a specific incident. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember one night, about 15 years ago. Tom had come home late, and I could smell the alcohol on him. I was in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner. He stumbled in, angry about something from work. I tried to ignore him, hoping he'd just go to bed, but...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He... he grabbed my arm, spun me around. His face was so close to mine, I could feel his hot breath. He started yelling about how I never supported him, how I was useless. I tried to pull away, but his grip just got tighter.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I was... I was terrified. My heart was racing, and I felt so small, so powerless. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) I know, I know. It's just... it feels so real again. I can almost smell the alcohol, feel his grip...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: He pushed me against the counter, still yelling. I remember the edge digging into my back. I tried to reason with him, to calm him down, but it only made him angrier. He... he slapped me across the face. The shock of it... I couldn't believe it was happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you react?",
    "Client: I... I froze. I couldn't move, couldn't speak. It was like all the air had been sucked out of the room. I just stood there, holding my cheek, staring at him in disbelief.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have that response. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but... I know it's important. After he hit me, he seemed to snap out of his rage for a moment. He looked... almost surprised at what he'd done. But then his face hardened again, and he stormed out of the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. How did you feel after he left?",
    "Client: I felt... numb. Like I was watching myself from outside my body. I remember sliding down to the floor, my back against the cabinets. I sat there for what felt like hours, just staring at nothing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It's just... thinking about it now, I feel so angry. Not just at him, but at myself for not leaving sooner. Why did I put up with it for so long?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. Remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I try to remind myself of that. It's just... sometimes I still hear his voice in my head, telling me I'm worthless, that no one else would want me.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than those thoughts. Keep going.",
    "Client: You're right. I am stronger now. After that night, something changed in me. I didn't leave immediately, but I started making plans. I opened a secret bank account, reached out to old friends. It took me almost a year, but I finally found the courage to leave.",
    "Therapist: That took immense strength. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, and there were times I almost went back. But I knew I deserved better. My kids deserved better.",
    "Therapist: You made a brave choice. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's hard, but also liberating. I feel lighter somehow, like I'm finally letting go of some of the weight I've been carrying all these years.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel hopeful about the future. I'm starting to see myself as a survivor, not a victim.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am. It's not always easy, but I'm getting there. Some days are harder than others, but I'm learning to be kind to myself, to give myself the love and respect I didn't get in my marriage.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something that's been bottled up for too long. It's scary to talk about these things, but I also feel stronger for having done it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm glad I came today, even though I was nervous. It helps to talk about these things, to know that I'm not alone in this journey.",
    "Therapist: You're never alone. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening, for helping me through this. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."
