    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those experiences... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget, and now you're asking me to remember? I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that once I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop. What if I completely fall apart? And then there's the pain... my chronic pain always gets worse when I'm stressed. I'm afraid this might trigger a really bad flare-up. Plus, as a refugee, I've worked so hard to build a new life here. I'm scared that digging up the past might undo all of that progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe just reassure me that I can stop if it gets too overwhelming? And perhaps we could have a plan in place for managing my pain if it flares up? I also think it would help if you could remind me why we're doing this. Sometimes I lose sight of the end goal when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace and can pause anytime. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps. I guess I'm also wondering what exactly we'll be doing. Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions? I'm trying to prepare myself mentally, but I'm not sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience while I guide you. Eyes closed often helps focus.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I can manage that. It's just... the last time I talked about this, it was during my asylum interview. That was so clinical and cold. I'm worried this might feel the same way. I don't want to feel like I'm being interrogated or judged.",
    "Therapist: This is different. It's about healing, not judgment. We're partners in your recovery.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I appreciate your patience with all my questions and concerns. I know this is probably routine for you, but for me, it feels like I'm about to jump off a cliff. I'm trying to be brave, but it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is challenging but can lead to significant healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to hold onto that hope. Can you tell me a bit about what I might experience during the exposure? I mean, emotionally or physically? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: You may feel intense emotions, physical sensations. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Before we start, is there anything I should do to prepare? Any breathing exercises or grounding techniques that might help?",
    "Therapist: Deep breaths help. Remember you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I'm nervous, but I trust you. Let's do this. I just hope that by the end of all this, I'll finally be able to move forward with my life without these memories haunting me every step of the way."
