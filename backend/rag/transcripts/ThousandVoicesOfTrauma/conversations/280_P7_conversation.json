    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe your combat experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol in Afghanistan. It was hot, dusty. We were walking through a village... I can see the mud-brick houses, smell the spices from cooking fires. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I felt the ground shake beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I heard screaming. My ears were ringing. There was smoke everywhere. I couldn't see clearly, but I saw one of my squad members on the ground. He wasn't moving.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I ran towards him, my heart pounding. As I got closer, I saw... oh god, there was so much blood. His leg was... it was gone. I froze for a second, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I snapped out of it and started yelling for a medic. I took off my belt to use as a tourniquet. My hands were shaking so much, but I managed to tie it around his thigh. The blood was so warm on my hands...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I kept talking to him, telling him to hang on. But his eyes were unfocused, and he was so pale. I could hear more explosions in the distance, gunfire. I was terrified we'd be hit again.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The medic finally arrived. I helped move my friend onto a stretcher. As we carried him, I kept looking around, expecting another attack. I felt so exposed, so helpless. We got him to the helicopter, but... he didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: I can see this is painful. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: After that, I couldn't sleep. Every noise made me jump. I kept seeing his face, feeling the blood on my hands. I felt like I failed him. Maybe if I'd been faster, or if I'd noticed something earlier...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did everything you could.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard. Sometimes I still wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I'm back there. The guilt... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're processing them well.",
    "Client: I've never told anyone all of this before. It's... it's difficult to talk about, but somehow it feels a bit lighter now that I've said it out loud.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This has brought up a lot of emotions I've been trying to avoid for years.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. You're doing important work here.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's strange, but even though remembering is painful, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm finally facing something I've been running from for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive reaction.",
    "Client: I think I'm ready to continue. There's more I want to share about that day, about the aftermath. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. After we got my friend to the helicopter, we had to continue our patrol. The threat wasn't over..."
