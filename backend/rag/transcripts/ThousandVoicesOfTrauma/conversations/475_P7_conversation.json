    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe your combat experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol in Afghanistan. It was hot, dusty. We were walking through a village, and suddenly there was an explosion. I remember the noise, the shock wave... it was so loud.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything happened so fast. There was smoke everywhere, and I could hear screaming. I saw one of my buddies on the ground, not moving. I froze for a second, I couldn't believe what was happening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I smell burning. And there's this ringing in my ears. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I see blood on my hands. I don't know if it's mine or someone else's. I'm shaking, and I feel so helpless. I should be doing something, helping someone, but I can't think straight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear someone shouting orders, but it sounds far away. I finally snap out of it and start moving. I'm running towards my friend on the ground, but it feels like I'm moving in slow motion. When I reach him, I can see he's badly hurt. I'm trying to remember my first aid training, but my mind is blank.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I start applying pressure to his wounds, but there's so much blood. I'm calling for a medic, screaming as loud as I can. I keep telling my friend to hang on, that help is coming. But I'm not sure if he can hear me. His eyes are open, but they look... empty.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: More explosions in the distance. I can hear gunfire now. I'm torn between staying with my friend and finding cover. I feel so exposed, like a target. I'm angry at myself for being scared, for not knowing what to do. I should be better prepared for this.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing fine.",
    "Client: Someone pulls me away from my friend. They're yelling at me to take cover. I don't want to leave him, but I know I have to. As I'm running for shelter, I see other injured soldiers. There's chaos everywhere. I feel like I'm in a nightmare that I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: We regroup behind some buildings. I'm shaking so bad I can barely hold my weapon. I can taste dirt and something metallic - probably blood. I'm trying to focus on what our sergeant is saying, but all I can think about is my friend and if he's still alive.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel sick to my stomach. My chest is tight, and I'm sweating. It's like I'm right back there. I can still hear the explosions and gunfire. I... I need a minute.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... I'm okay. It's just... it's so vivid. I can still see their faces, hear their screams. I've never felt so helpless in my life. And the guilt... why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wish I could forget it all. But then I feel guilty for wanting to forget. Like I'm betraying my friends who didn't make it. It's just... it's too much sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My heart is still racing, but I feel a little calmer. It's strange, talking about it... it's painful, but there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... I think it might be helping. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a common experience. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to get better, to not let this control my life anymore. But it's scary, facing these memories. Sometimes I worry that I'll never be the same person I was before.",
    "Therapist: Change is part of healing. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just... it's a lot to process. But I'm grateful for this space to talk about it. To finally let some of it out. I've kept it bottled up for so long, afraid of what would happen if I let myself remember.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... I feel a little lighter. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. It's still there, but the load is a bit easier. Is it okay if we stop here for today? I think I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance and support. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous about what else might come up, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Hope is a good sign. We'll end here for today."
