    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's quite frightening. I've spent years trying to push them away, you know? And now you're asking me to bring them back. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle the emotions that come up? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my anxiety... it's been worse lately. Especially since my wife passed away last year. I'm afraid this might be too much for me to handle.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking that. I think... I think I need to know that I can stop if it becomes overwhelming. And maybe some reassurance that this won't make things worse? I've been managing, you know, running my small business, living with my son and his family. I don't want to disrupt the fragile balance I've achieved.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... that's reassuring. Thank you. I suppose I'm also curious about what exactly we'll be doing. Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions? I'm trying to prepare myself mentally for what's to come.",
    "Therapist: We'll start with eyes open. I'll guide you through recalling a memory. You'll describe it aloud.",
    "Client: I see. That doesn't sound too intimidating when you put it that way. I've always been good with words, even in English, which isn't my first language. But I'm worried about getting too emotional. In my culture, we don't usually express our feelings so openly, especially men of my generation. It's... uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: Your cultural background is important. We'll respect your boundaries. How can we make this more comfortable?",
    "Client: That means a lot to me, doctor. Perhaps we could agree on a signal if I need a break? And maybe you could remind me that it's okay to feel emotional? I know it sounds silly, but hearing that from you might help me feel less... ashamed, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Not silly at all. We'll use a hand signal for breaks. Emotions are welcome here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm feeling a bit more at ease now. One last question, if you don't mind. How will this help with my PTSD symptoms? I've been having these awful nightmares and flashbacks, and sometimes I feel so detached from everything around me. Will this really make a difference?",
    "Therapist: Great question. Exposure helps process memories, reducing nightmares and flashbacks over time. It's proven effective.",
    "Client: I see. Well, I suppose if it's been proven to work, it's worth trying. I've come this far in therapy, and I want to get better. For myself, and for my family. They've been so supportive, especially since I lost my wife. I want to be present for them, to enjoy my grandchildren without this constant shadow hanging over me. If this can help with that, then I'm willing to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, doctor. And I trust the process. Let's do this."
