    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that awful day at the hospital... it's making my stomach churn just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it in detail will make everything feel fresh again. I've worked so hard to push those memories away. What if this sets me back? And... I'm embarrassed about how I might react. What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help. I need to understand what I'm getting myself into here.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. We'll go slowly, and you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. But what exactly will happen during the session? Will I need to close my eyes and visualize everything? I'm not sure I can do that without panicking.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event aloud. Eyes open or closed \u2013 your choice. We'll pause if needed.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I can manage that. But what if I get overwhelmed? Sometimes when I think about that day, I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: We'll practice grounding techniques beforehand. I'll guide you through if needed.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I appreciate your support. I guess I'm just scared of facing these memories head-on. They've been locked away for so long.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. This process helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's been affecting my work and my relationship with my spouse. They've been so patient, but I know it's been hard on them too. I'm willing to try if it means I can start feeling like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is a strength. Shall we review grounding techniques now?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help me feel more prepared. And... thank you for being so understanding. It means a lot to have someone who gets how difficult this is."
