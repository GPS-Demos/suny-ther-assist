    "Therapist: Alright, Priya, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that night...",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. I can see our living room. It's dark, just the TV flickering. I hear shouting from the kitchen. My heart is racing already.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. I feel tense.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I... I can hear glass shattering. My mom screams. I'm frozen on the couch, wanting to help but too scared to move. The shouting gets louder, and I hear heavy footsteps. My dad storms into the living room, his face twisted with anger. I can smell the alcohol on him from across the room.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay, Priya. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He sees me on the couch and starts yelling at me to go to my room. But I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear. Then my mom comes in, crying, begging him to stop. He turns to her and... and... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) He... he hits her. Hard. She falls against the wall. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I can see blood on her face. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: (nodding, breathing heavily) I know. It just feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I think so. My dad is still yelling, but his words are slurred. He's swaying on his feet. My mom is crying softly, holding her face. I finally find my voice and yell at him to stop. He turns to me, his eyes blazing with fury. For a moment, I think he's going to hit me too.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe an 8. I feel angry now, not just scared.",
    "Therapist: That's interesting. Let's explore that.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I remember feeling this surge of protectiveness for my mom. I stood up, even though I was shaking. I told him I'd call the police if he didn't leave. I don't know where I found the courage.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that courage make you feel?",
    "Client: Stronger, I guess. My heart's still racing, but I feel... proud? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a valid feeling.",
    "Client: He looked shocked for a moment, then stormed out, slamming the door. I remember running to my mom, hugging her, both of us crying. I felt so many things at once - relief, fear, anger, love.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 again. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowered? Like I'm not just a victim in this memory anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Priya. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's still painful, but it feels different somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's common. We'll end here for today. You did excellent work."
