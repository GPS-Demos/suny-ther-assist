    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Chen, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your SUDS rating now.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Please close your eyes and describe the airplane crash scene.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm sitting in my seat, 14C. The plane is shaking violently. People are screaming. I... I can smell something burning. The oxygen masks drop down, and I'm fumbling to put mine on. My hands are trembling so much...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and my chest feels tight. The memory is so vivid... it's like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7. I feel so helpless, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is losing altitude rapidly. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. People are praying, crying. I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Gasping) The impact is terrible. There's a deafening crash, and everything goes dark. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt digging into my waist. I can taste blood in my mouth. The smell of fuel is overwhelming. I'm... I'm trapped, and I can hear people moaning in pain around me...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel nauseous. My heart is racing. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I can't seem to shake this feeling of panic.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my fingers are numb. I can hear sirens in the distance. There's smoke everywhere, making it hard to breathe. I'm calling out for help, but my voice sounds weak. I'm so scared... I don't know if anyone will find me in time.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My legs feel weak, even sitting here. I have this urge to run away, to escape.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I'm starting to remember that I survived this.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear voices getting closer. Someone's shouting, asking if anyone can hear them. I try to call out louder. Suddenly, there's a beam of light. A firefighter appears, reaching out to me. I grab his hand, and he pulls me out. The relief is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer. My breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's dropped to a 6. I still feel shaky, but not as panicked.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm being carried away from the wreckage. The cool air hits my face, and I can breathe easier. Paramedics are checking me over. I'm in shock, but I realize I'm alive. I made it through...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... relieved. My body is starting to relax a bit.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You can open your eyes now.",

    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was tough, but I feel like I faced something important. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
