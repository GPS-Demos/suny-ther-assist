    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory... it's like I was right back there, you know? Watching it all happen again. I can still hear the shouting, the crashes. It's like it's echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why didn't I do something? I was just a child, but... maybe if I'd called for help or... I don't know. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I know, logically, there was nothing I could've done. But the feeling's still there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up around my ears, I think. And there's this knot in my stomach. It's like... like I'm still bracing for something bad to happen. Even though I know I'm safe here, my body hasn't caught up yet.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Really angry. Not at you or anything, just... at the situation, I guess. At the people who were supposed to protect me. It's this hot feeling in my chest, and I want to... I don't know, scream or throw something. But I also feel scared of that anger, like it might consume me if I let it out.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also kind of freeing? Like, for so long I've tried to push it down, pretend it wasn't there. But now that I'm facing it, it's like... it's a part of me, but it doesn't have to control me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What else is coming up for you?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my life. Even now, at 69, I still struggle with trust. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? It's exhausting. But going through this memory, as hard as it is, it's like... maybe I can start to let some of that go? Not forget it, but... not let it have so much power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... hopeful, I guess? But also terrifying. This has been a part of me for so long, I'm not sure who I am without it. But I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I want to be able to relax, to trust people. To not always be on guard. It's like... I'm standing on the edge of something, and I know I need to jump, but I'm not sure what's waiting for me at the bottom.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What would it mean for you to take that jump?",
    "Client: I think... it would mean freedom. Real freedom. Not just physically, but emotionally. To be able to enjoy life without always looking over my shoulder. To be able to form close relationships without pushing people away. It's... it's what I've always wanted, but never thought I could have. And now, maybe... maybe it's possible? It's a lot to take in.",
    "Therapist: It is. How are you feeling now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I'm... calmer, I think. Still a bit shaky, but not as much. It's like... like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years. I'm not used to the lightness yet, and part of me wants to pick it back up because it's familiar. But another part of me is starting to realize how much energy it took to carry it all this time. I'm tired, but... a good kind of tired? Like after a long hike or something.",
    "Therapist: That's a vivid description. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I just need a moment. To sit with all of this. It's a lot to process, you know? But I'm glad we did this. It was hard, really hard, but... I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. And maybe... maybe that's the first step towards healing?",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit quietly for a minute? I'd like to try and ground myself a bit before I leave. Maybe do one of those breathing exercises we've practiced? I think that would help me feel more... centered, I guess. And then maybe we could talk about what to expect between now and our next session? I'm a bit nervous about how I'll feel once I'm home alone.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that breathing exercise now.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps. I feel more... present now. Still a bit wobbly, but not as overwhelmed. I think I'm ready to talk about what comes next.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What concerns do you have about the time between sessions?",
    "Client: I'm worried the memories might come flooding back when I'm alone. Or that I might have nightmares. I know we've talked about coping strategies before, but... well, this feels different. More intense. I'm not sure if I'm ready to handle it on my own.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's review some strategies.",
    "Client: Okay. I remember we talked about journaling, and using that grounding technique with the five senses. And calling my support person if things get too overwhelming. Is there... is there anything else you'd recommend, given how intense this session was?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. Perhaps also consider...",
    "Client: [Interrupting] Oh, and the relaxation audio you gave me! I almost forgot about that. I think I'll put that on my bedside table as a reminder to use it. And... is it okay if I call you if I'm really struggling? I know you said it was alright before, but I always feel like I'm bothering you.",
    "Therapist: You're not bothering me. My role is to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. That... that means a lot. I think I'm feeling a bit better about going home now. It's still scary, but... I feel like I have some tools to help me cope. And knowing I can reach out if I need to... that helps. I'm... I'm glad I came today, even though it was hard. I feel like I've taken a step forward, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's great. Is there anything else you'd like to address?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I mean, there's probably a million things swirling around in my head right now, but... I think I need some time to process it all. Is that okay? To just... sit with all of this for a while?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's an important part of the process.",
    "Client: Okay. Good. I... thank you. For today, for everything. I know I've got a long way to go, but... I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. It won't be easy, but... I'm starting to believe it's possible. And that's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready to go now. I feel steadier, more grounded. And I know what to do if things get tough at home. So... yeah. I think I'm okay to head out. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time next week. Take care, and remember to use your coping strategies.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week."
