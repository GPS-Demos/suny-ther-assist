    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. As ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our living room. Sarah's sitting on the couch, and she looks... God, she looks so tired. There are boxes everywhere. I can smell the cardboard and packing tape.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's evening. The sun's setting, casting this orange glow through the windows. It feels... wrong. Like the world shouldn't look so beautiful right now.",
    "Therapist: What's happening?",
    "Client: Sarah's telling me she can't do this anymore. That my nightmares, my... my anger... it's too much. I want to tell her I'll change, that I'll get help, but... the words won't come out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. My hands are... they're shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 70?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I watch her pack her clothes. Each time she folds something, it's like... it's like she's folding away a piece of our life together. I want to stop her, but I'm frozen. All I can think about is... is how I failed her. How I let the war change me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about the last time I held her. Before I deployed. How I promised her I'd come back the same man. But I didn't. I came back... broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. I'm safe. (deep breath) Sarah's crying now. She's telling me she loves me, but she can't watch me destroy myself. And I... I want to tell her about the things I've seen, the things I've done. But I can't burden her with that. So I just... I just stand there, silent.",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could say to her?",
    "Client: I wish... I wish I could tell her I'm sorry. That I never meant to hurt her. That the nightmares, the flashbacks... they're not her fault. That I'm scared too.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to say that now?",
    "Client: It hurts. God, it hurts so much. But... but there's also this... relief? Like I'm finally admitting it to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's good, John. You're processing these emotions. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down a bit. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Keep going.",
    "Client: She's... she's zipping up her suitcase now. The sound... it's so final. Like the period at the end of a sentence. She looks at me, and her eyes... they're full of pain, but also... pity? And that... that kills me inside.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally move. I reach out to her, but she steps back. She says, \"I hope you find peace, John.\" And then... then she's gone. The door closes, and I'm alone. The silence... it's deafening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Empty. Like everything good in my life just walked out that door. But there's also this... this anger. At myself, at the war, at the world. I want to scream, to break something, but I don't. I just... I just sit on the floor, surrounded by half-empty boxes and memories.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropping. Maybe 65 now? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's like... like I'm letting some of the pressure out.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I... I stay on the floor for hours. The room gets dark, but I don't turn on the lights. I keep replaying everything in my head. Our first date, our wedding, the day I deployed... and now this. It's like... it's like my whole life is flashing before my eyes, but I'm not dying. Just... changing.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about how I pushed her away. How I couldn't let her in. I'm angry at myself for not getting help sooner. But I'm also... I'm also relieved? And that makes me feel guilty. Like... like maybe I knew this was coming. Maybe I wanted it, in some twisted way.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: My chest... it's not as tight anymore. I feel... drained. Exhausted. But also... lighter? Like... like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now... now I'm finally putting it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Let's keep going.",
    "Client: I... I finally get up. My legs are stiff, and I stumble a bit. I go to the kitchen and pour myself a glass of water. The house feels... different. Bigger, maybe? Or just... emptier. I look at the fridge, and all our photos are still there. Sarah and me at the beach, at her sister's wedding... I take them down, one by one. Each one feels like... like I'm saying goodbye to a different version of myself.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. Sad, but also... necessary? Like I'm clearing the way for something new. I don't know what yet, but... but something.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Really tired. But also... calm? Like the storm has passed, and now I'm just... here. In the aftermath.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe 40 now?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, John. You've done really well today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I've taken a step. A small one, maybe, but... but a step. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... freeing? Like I'm not carrying this secret anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great way to look at it. We'll stop here for today. You've shown incredible courage. How are you feeling about ending the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Drained, but... but okay. Thank you for... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll continue next session. Take care."
