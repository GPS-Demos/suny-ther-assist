    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. The pain in my back has been acting up, which always makes me more anxious.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How familiar are you with this technique?",
    "Client: Not very. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a powerful tool to help process trauma. Can you share your main concern?",
    "Client: I'm worried about reliving the earthquake. It was so terrifying, and I'm scared of feeling that helpless again. Plus, with my chronic pain, I'm not sure how my body will react to the stress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you typically manage stress with your pain condition?",
    "Client: I try to do some gentle stretching or deep breathing. Sometimes I use a heating pad. But when the memories of the earthquake come, it's hard to focus on anything else.",
    "Therapist: We'll incorporate those coping strategies. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: How long will it take? Will I have to close my eyes? What if I panic and can't continue?",
    "Therapist: It'll last about 30-45 minutes. Eyes closed is optional. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: A bit better, I suppose. But I'm still nervous. What if talking about it brings back the nightmares? I've just started sleeping better recently.",
    "Therapist: That's a common worry. How have you been managing your sleep lately?",
    "Client: I've been sticking to a regular bedtime routine, like we discussed. It helps most nights, but I'm worried this will undo all that progress.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is cumulative. This exercise may temporarily increase distress, but it's crucial for long-term healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I guess so. I trust you, and I want to get better. It's just hard to face it all again. Being unemployed gives me too much time to dwell on these memories, you know?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your courage. Remember, you're in control. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm ready. Just... please don't let me get too overwhelmed. I'm counting on you to help me through this.",
    "Therapist: I'm here to support you. Let's begin by focusing on your breathing..."
