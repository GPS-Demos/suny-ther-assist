    "Therapist: Mrs. Johnson, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Oh, dear. I'm not sure I'm ready for this. The idea of revisiting that terrible earthquake... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's normal to feel anxious. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about getting too overwhelmed. What if I can't handle it? And how will this help with my racial trauma? The earthquake was frightening, but the discrimination I faced during the relief efforts was equally traumatizing.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. This process can help with both traumas. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I suppose that's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still nervous. Will you be with me the whole time? And what exactly will I need to do?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. You'll describe the event in detail, present tense. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: Oh my, that sounds intense. I'm willing to give it a try, but I'm scared of reliving those moments. The shaking, the fear, the uncertainty... and then the way some people treated us afterward, as if we didn't deserve help just because of our background. It's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But can we start slowly? And if I need to take a break, that's okay, right? I'm just worried about my chronic pain flaring up if I get too stressed. It's been acting up lately, and I don't want it to get worse.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start slow and take breaks as needed. How would you like to begin?",
    "Client: Well, I guess I could start by describing the morning of the earthquake. It was such a normal day until... until everything changed. Is that okay? Should I close my eyes or keep them open?",
    "Therapist: That's a perfect start. Do whatever feels comfortable. Ready when you are.",
    "Client: Okay, here goes. I'm in my kitchen, making tea. The sun is shining through the window, and I can hear birds chirping outside. Everything is calm, and then suddenly..."
