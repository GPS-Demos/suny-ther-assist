    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Remembering those moments, it's like I'm right back there again. The fear, the helplessness... it's so vivid. I can still feel the rough hands grabbing me, hear the harsh voices... (voice trembles) It's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The smell. It's strange, but I could smell the musty room so clearly. And the sound of footsteps approaching... my heart races just thinking about it. I keep seeing their faces, you know? The men who... who took advantage of me. (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's like I'm trapped in that moment all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. I feel angry, scared, and somehow... ashamed? Even though I know it wasn't my fault. (sighs) But there's also this tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe stronger? Like I survived that, and I'm here now, talking about it. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That mix of emotions is normal. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my family, especially my late husband. If he knew... (tears up) I wonder if he would've looked at me differently. And my children... I've never told them. I feel like I'm carrying this huge secret, and it's eating me up inside. But at the same time, I'm terrified of them finding out.",
    "Therapist: How does carrying this secret impact you?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I feel like I'm always on guard, always worried someone will find out. It affects my relationships, my work... everything. I struggle to trust people, to let anyone get close. And the nightmares... they're less frequent now, but when they come, they're so real. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling just as helpless as I did back then.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How has this process been?",
    "Client: It's... challenging. But also, in a way, liberating? Talking about it, facing these memories head-on... it's terrifying, but I also feel like I'm finally confronting something I've run from for so long. There are moments when I want to give up, to go back to pretending it never happened. But then I think about how much that pretending has cost me, and I know I need to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful insight. What's helping you continue?",
    "Client: The hope that maybe, just maybe, I can find some peace. That I can look in the mirror and not see a victim, but a survivor. (wipes tears) I want to be able to form meaningful relationships again, to trust, to live without this constant fear and shame. It's hard, but I'm starting to believe it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Any strategies helping you cope?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been surprisingly helpful. When I feel overwhelmed, focusing on my breath grounds me. And writing... I've started journaling after our sessions. It helps me process everything we discuss. Sometimes I even write letters to my younger self, trying to offer the comfort and understanding I needed back then.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent tools. How else has this impacted your life?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm a bit more present in my daily life. Before, I was always on autopilot, just going through the motions. Now, even though it's painful, I feel more... alive? And I've started reaching out to old friends, just small steps, but it feels significant. There's still a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like there might be light at the end of this very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's remarkable progress, Maria. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It's not easy, and there are days when I question if I can do this. But then I remind myself of how far I've come already. I want to keep going. I want to reclaim my life, my identity. It's scary, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I deserve that chance at happiness and peace.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. It's been intense, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I'm grateful for this space to heal. (smiles weakly) Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, Maria."
