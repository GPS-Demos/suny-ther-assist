    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm honestly a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting my mom's illness and passing... it's overwhelming. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is completely understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so much time trying to avoid thinking about those last few weeks in the hospital. The smell of disinfectant, the beeping machines, seeing her waste away... I'm afraid if I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop crying. And what if it makes everything worse instead of better?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've been having nightmares and flashbacks, and they catch me off guard. Perhaps if I confront the memories head-on, they won't have as much power over me? But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It's about reducing their impact. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: How long will we spend on this? Do I have to describe every detail? What if I get too upset and can't continue? And... will you be there to support me through it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here throughout. What else would help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we have a signal if I need a break? And perhaps having a stress ball or something to hold onto might help ground me. Also, is it okay if I bring a photo of my mom from happier times to look at afterward?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are excellent ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still nervous, but a bit more prepared. I appreciate your patience and support. I know this won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. I want to be able to remember my mom without falling apart every time.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm ready. Let's do this."
