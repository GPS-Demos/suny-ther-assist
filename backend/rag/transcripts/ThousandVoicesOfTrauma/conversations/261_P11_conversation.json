    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've been through so many natural disasters in my life, but reliving that car accident... it just hits differently. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The screeching of tires, the crunch of metal... It's like they're echoing in my head even now. And the helplessness. I keep thinking about how I couldn't do anything to prevent it. It reminds me of when the typhoon hit our village when I was young. That same feeling of being at the mercy of something beyond my control.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I've been avoiding driving, especially in bad weather. And loud, sudden noises make me jumpy. I guess I'm always on edge, waiting for the next disaster to strike. It's exhausting, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I realized that... maybe I'm not as helpless as I feel. I survived both events, didn't I? And talking about it, as difficult as it is, doesn't make the memories worse. If anything, it's like... like I'm starting to see them from a different perspective.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, no doubt about it. But, um, I think it's worth it. I'm tired of living in fear, you know? I want to be able to drive again, to not flinch at every loud noise. And maybe... maybe I can finally stop feeling guilty about surviving when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What's one thing you can do this week to build on this progress?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try sitting in my car for a few minutes each day. Not driving, just... being there. And perhaps listening to some traffic sounds on my phone to get used to them again. Is that... is that a good idea?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent step. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... keep pushing me, I guess. Even when it's hard. I know I might resist sometimes, but I need this. And maybe we could talk more about the guilt next time? I feel like that's a big part of what's holding me back.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I appreciate your patience with me. I know I'm not the easiest client, especially with our age difference and all. But you've been very understanding. It means a lot, especially since I've been alone since my wife passed. This therapy, it's become an important part of my week.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit in silence for a moment? I need to collect myself before heading back out into the world. And maybe... maybe you could remind me of that breathing exercise we did last time? I think that might help ground me a bit.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm ready."
