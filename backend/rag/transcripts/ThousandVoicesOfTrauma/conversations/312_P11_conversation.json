    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. It's all a bit overwhelming. Reliving that moment when I witnessed the violence that led to my wife's death... it's like I was right back there again. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The screaming, the gunshots... they were so vivid. I could almost smell the gunpowder. And my wife's face... the fear in her eyes. It's haunting me all over again. I thought I had managed to push these memories away, but now they're all flooding back.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Terrifying, really. I felt so helpless, just like I did that day. There was this overwhelming sense of panic, and then... guilt. Why couldn't I do more? Why didn't I react faster? Maybe if I had, she'd still be... (voice breaks) I'm sorry, I just... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time.",
    "Client: (deep breath) You know, I've spent the last two years trying to avoid thinking about this. I threw myself into work, kept busy, anything to keep my mind off it. But going through it again today, it's like... it's forcing me to confront everything I've been running from.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm starting to see how much this has affected me. The nightmares, the constant alertness, always checking over my shoulder... it's all connected to this moment, isn't it? And the loneliness... I've pushed everyone away because I was afraid of feeling this pain again.",
    "Therapist: What insights are you gaining from this process?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing that avoiding these memories hasn't really helped me. It's just kept me stuck. And maybe... maybe by facing this head-on, I can start to process it properly. It's scary, but... I want to be able to remember my wife without feeling this overwhelming fear and guilt.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's daunting, I won't lie. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a glimmer of hope? Like maybe there's a way through this that I couldn't see before. I want to keep going. I need to, for my own sake and... for her memory. She wouldn't want me to live like this forever.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try opening up more. Maybe reconnect with some old friends, or join a support group. And definitely continue with these sessions. It's painful, but I can see now that it's necessary. I want to be able to think about her, talk about her, without falling apart. I want to honor her memory by living fully again. It's what she would have wanted.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How can we support that?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. Maybe... could we work on some strategies for managing the anxiety when these memories come up? And perhaps... find ways for me to start talking about her more? I've avoided even saying her name for so long. It feels important to change that.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that it's necessary. And maybe, just maybe, there's light at the end of this very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but also somewhat eager. It's strange to feel anticipation about something so difficult, but I think I understand now why this process is important. I'm committed to seeing it through, no matter how challenging it gets.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's all for now. This session has given me a lot to process. I'm exhausted, but in a way that feels... productive, if that makes sense. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I'm moving in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today, John. Take care of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you, I will. See you next week."
