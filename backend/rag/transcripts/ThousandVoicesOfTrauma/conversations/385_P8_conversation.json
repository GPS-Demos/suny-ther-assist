    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of... disconnected? Like I'm not fully here. The memory, it was so vivid this time. I could almost smell the musty carpet in that room, feel the rough texture against my skin. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) It's a mix of things. There's this deep sadness, like a heaviness in my chest. But there's also... anger? Yeah, definitely anger. I'm furious at him for what he did, for taking away my sense of safety. And I'm angry at myself too, for not fighting back harder, even though I know logically that I couldn't have. It's just... it's all tangled up inside me.",
    "Therapist: You're acknowledging complex emotions. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit liberating? I've spent so long trying to push these feelings down, to pretend they didn't exist. But now, letting myself feel them, it's like... I don't know, like I'm finally giving myself permission to be human? Does that make sense? It hurts, god it hurts so much, but it also feels like... like I'm finally dealing with it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how young I was, how innocent. And then I think about my own daughter, who's around that age now, and it just... it breaks my heart. I have this overwhelming urge to protect her, to make sure nothing like this ever happens to her. But then I start spiraling, thinking about all the dangers out there, all the ways I could fail her. It's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess they show how far I've come, in a way? Before, I couldn't even think about what happened without completely shutting down. Now, I can face it, even if it's painful. And thinking about my daughter... it's like, I'm not just doing this for me anymore. I'm doing it for her too, so I can be the best mother possible. But it's also scary, because it makes everything feel so much more urgent and important.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound connection. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my relationships, especially with my partner. There are times when he touches me, and I just freeze up. It's not him, it's... it's the memory. And I've never really explained it to him, I've just pulled away. I think... I think I need to talk to him about this. He deserves to understand, and maybe... maybe it'll help us be closer.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of sharing with your partner make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. Really scared. But also... hopeful? Like, maybe if I let him in, let him see this part of me, we could have a deeper connection. And maybe he could help me feel safe again. It's just... it's hard to be vulnerable like that. What if he looks at me differently? What if he can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. What might help you feel more secure in sharing?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe if I start small? Like, not telling him everything at once, but gradually opening up. And maybe... maybe I could ask him to come to a session with me sometime? Having you here might make me feel safer, more supported. Is that something we could do?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can discuss that further. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also lighter somehow? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's still there, I can still see it, but I'm not actively bearing the weight right now. And there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope maybe? Like maybe I can actually get through this, come out the other side stronger. It's scary, but... but I think I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's incredible progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on coping strategies for when the memories hit unexpectedly. And maybe... maybe we could start talking about how to approach the conversation with my partner? I'm nervous about it, but I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there. It's terrifying and exhausting, but also... kind of exciting? Like I'm finally taking my life back. I'm grateful for your help in this process.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. We'll continue next week. Take care."
