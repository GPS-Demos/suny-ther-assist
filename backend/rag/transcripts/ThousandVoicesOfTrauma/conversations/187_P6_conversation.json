    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you're in control here. Can you start by describing the scene and giving me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the military base. It's night, and I'm walking to my quarters after a late shift. The air is heavy and warm. I can hear crickets chirping. My SUDS... I'd say it's about a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Please continue.",
    "Client: I see a figure approaching in the darkness. My heart starts to race a little. It's... it's Sergeant Miller. He's walking towards me with purpose. I can smell alcohol on his breath as he gets closer. My palms are getting sweaty, and I'm feeling uneasy. The SUDS is creeping up, maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's... he's grabbing my arm now. I can feel his rough hands on my skin. I'm trying to pull away, but he's so much stronger. My throat feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing. The crickets seem louder now, almost deafening. I... I can't... (voice breaking)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Sarah. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is so tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Can you tell me what you're noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and my heart is pounding so hard. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out. I can still smell his breath, and it's making me nauseous. I want to run, but my legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's pulling me behind the building. I'm trying to scream, but no sound comes out. I can feel the rough wall against my back. I'm so scared and angry. Why can't I fight back? Why am I so weak? (sobbing)",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Sarah. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 10. I can't... I can't do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You can do this. You're stronger than you think. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... okay. I'm trying. The memory is so vivid. I can feel everything like it's happening right now. But... but I know I'm here with you. I'm... I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I think so. After it happened, I remember stumbling back to my quarters. I felt so dirty, so ashamed. I couldn't stop shaking. I wanted to tell someone, but I was afraid no one would believe me. I felt so alone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I still feel shaky, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: Okay. The next day, I saw him at the mess hall. He acted like nothing happened. I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't eat. I wanted to scream, to tell everyone what he did, but I just sat there, silent. I felt so powerless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I'm... I'm starting to feel a little calmer. It still hurts, but I'm not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. How are you feeling about sharing this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also, I feel a little lighter. Like I'm not carrying this secret alone anymore. My SUDS is probably a 6 now. I'm still anxious, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Sarah. You've shown incredible courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I could talk about this without falling apart. But here I am, doing it. It's still painful, but I feel like I'm taking back some control. My SUDS is down to a 5 now. I'm exhausted, but also... maybe a little proud of myself?",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. How about we wrap up here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I can get through this after all.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done amazing work today, Sarah."
