    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my illness, and that always brings up a lot for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? My stomach's a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm in the hospital room. It's so... sterile. The walls are this sickly pale green color, and there's that constant beeping from the machines. I'm lying in the bed, and I feel so weak. My body aches all over, and I'm hooked up to all these tubes and wires. The smell of disinfectant is overwhelming, it's making me feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What's happening?",
    "Client: A nurse comes in to check my vitals. She's trying to be gentle, but even her light touch hurts. I want to tell her to stop, but I don't have the energy. I'm... I'm so scared. What if I don't get better? What if this is it?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My hands are clammy, and I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... The doctor comes in now. He's looking at my chart, and his face is so serious. I can tell it's not good news. He starts explaining something about test results, but his words are just... they're just washing over me. All I can focus on is the pit in my stomach, this overwhelming sense of dread.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. I'm too young for this. What about my family? My career?\" It's like my whole life is slipping away, and I'm powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: My husband arrives. He's trying to put on a brave face, but I can see the fear in his eyes. He takes my hand, and it's like... it's like I can physically feel his worry. I want to comfort him, but I can barely muster the strength to squeeze his hand back.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. So incredibly guilty. He shouldn't have to deal with this. None of them should. I'm supposed to be the strong one, the one who takes care of everyone else. And now... now I'm just a burden.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are memories. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Breathes shakily) The night comes, and everyone's gone home. The room is dark except for the glow of the monitors. I'm alone, and the pain is worse. Every breath hurts. I'm lying there, staring at the ceiling, and I just feel so... abandoned. Neglected. Like I'm not important enough for anyone to stay with me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very difficult. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. I count the tiles on the ceiling, I listen to the rhythms of the machines. But my mind keeps drifting to worst-case scenarios. What if I die here, alone in this cold room? What if I never get to say goodbye?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. I feel like I'm drowning in fear and loneliness. I want to call for a nurse, for anyone, but I don't. I don't want to be a bother. So I just lie there, silent tears rolling down my face, feeling more alone than I've ever felt in my life.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Remember where you are right now.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The night seems to last forever. Every time I start to drift off, a new wave of pain hits me. By morning, I'm exhausted, both physically and emotionally. When the nurse comes in, I can barely respond to her questions. I feel... I feel like I'm fading away.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Is this what my life has come to? Am I going to die here, in this sterile room, away from everything I love?\" It's like... it's like I can feel my life force draining away with each passing hour.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: My doctor comes in for rounds. He's talking about treatment options, but his voice sounds distant, muffled. I'm trying to focus, to understand, but it's so hard. I feel like I'm underwater, everything's distorted. And then... then he says something that cuts through the fog. \"We're going to fight this.\" And for a moment, just a brief moment, I feel a flicker of hope.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's fragile. Like a tiny flame that could be snuffed out at any moment. But it's there, and I'm clinging to it with everything I have.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: As the day goes on, I start to notice little things. The way the sunlight filters through the blinds. The kindness in the nurse's eyes when she adjusts my pillows. My husband's voice when he calls to check on me. It's like... it's like I'm seeing everything through new eyes. Every small comfort feels magnified.",
    "Therapist: How does that change your perspective?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm more aware of the preciousness of life, but also of how close I am to losing it. I find myself oscillating between gratitude and fear, hope and despair. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: As night falls again, I'm dreading another long, lonely stretch of darkness. But this time, a nurse comes in and sits with me for a while. She holds my hand and tells me stories about other patients who've recovered. For the first time since I've been here, I don't feel completely alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that support affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a lifeline. Like someone's thrown me a rope when I was drowning. I still feel scared and uncertain, but not as... not as abandoned. There's a sense that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's lower. Around 40, I think.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today, Sarah. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths and opens eyes) Wow... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll process this more next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think this is helping, even though it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. We'll end here for today. Take care, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
