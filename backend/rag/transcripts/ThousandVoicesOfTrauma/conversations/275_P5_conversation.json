    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous, Dr. Thompson. I've been dreading this part of our sessions. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's unsettling. I've worked so hard to push them away, you know? And now you're asking me to bring them back. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've finally gotten to a place where I can function day-to-day without constantly thinking about the hurricane. I'm worried that diving back into those memories will undo all the progress I've made. Plus, with everything going on in the news about police brutality, I'm already on edge. I'm not sure I can handle more stress right now.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process things I've been avoiding? But I'm scared it'll make everything worse. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let me explain how we'll approach this safely.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to admit, my heart's racing just thinking about it. It's like I can already feel the wind and hear the crashing of the waves. And then my mind jumps to the recent footage of protests and police violence... it's all mixing together in my head.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will this take? Will I have to relive every detail? And what happens if it becomes too much? I'm worried I might have a panic attack or something. Also, how does this help with my current anxieties about police brutality?",
    "Therapist: Great questions. We'll take breaks as needed and you're in control. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help me feel more prepared. I've been using some breathing techniques you taught me, but I'm not sure if that'll be enough for this. And I'm curious about how this connects to my current fears about what's happening in the world.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's review those techniques and add new ones. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Thompson. I know this is important, but it's just so daunting. I keep thinking about my family, how scared we all were during the hurricane, and now I'm scared for them in a different way with all the unrest. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, John. Shall we begin with a relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. And thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear you acknowledge how difficult this is. I'm trying to remind myself that facing this could help me be stronger for my family, both in dealing with past traumas and current fears. Okay, I'm ready for the relaxation exercise.",
    "Therapist: Great. Let's start with deep breathing. Close your eyes when you're ready."
