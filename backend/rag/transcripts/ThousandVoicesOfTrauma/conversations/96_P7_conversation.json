    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the car accident for me?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving to the grocery store. It was a sunny day, and I remember feeling happy because I was going to buy ingredients for my wife's favorite meal. I was at an intersection, waiting for the light to turn green.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The light turned green, and I started to move forward. Suddenly, I heard a loud screeching noise. I turned my head to the left and saw a car speeding towards me. It was all happening so fast, I couldn't react.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the other car, it's red and coming straight at me. The driver's face looks panicked. I feel my heart racing, my hands gripping the steering wheel so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a deafening crash. Metal crunching, glass shattering. My body jerks violently to the side. I feel a sharp pain in my chest and left arm. Everything's spinning. I can smell gasoline and something burning.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm having trouble breathing. The airbag deployed and there's dust everywhere. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm so disoriented. I keep thinking about my wife, wondering if I'll see her again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: People are shouting outside the car. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can't respond. I'm trapped, and I'm terrified. The pain is getting worse, and I'm starting to lose consciousness.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Everything goes dark. The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. The doctors are telling me I've been in an accident, but all I can think about is my wife. I keep asking for her, but no one will tell me anything.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My chest feels tight, just like it did that day. I can still hear the crash, smell the burning. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I found out later that day that my wife had a heart attack when she heard about my accident. She... she didn't make it. I lost her because of that crash. If I hadn't gone out that day...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Stay present.",
    "Client: I know, but it's so hard. I miss her every day. The accident took away my ability to drive, my independence, and worst of all, it took away my Mar\u00eda. Sometimes I wonder why I survived when she didn't.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're very strong.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult to talk about this, but I suppose it helps. I just wish I could go back and change things. I feel so guilty, so angry at myself and at the other driver.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings.",
    "Client: I know, but they're so intense. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I hear the crash again. I feel so alone in those moments, without Mar\u00eda there to comfort me.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. I'm here with you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... life has changed so much since that day. Moving to assisted living, losing my independence, losing Mar\u00eda... it's been overwhelming. Some days I don't even want to get out of bed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're coping well.",
    "Client: I'm trying. It's just hard to see a future sometimes. Mar\u00eda and I had so many plans for our retirement. Now, I'm just trying to get through each day. But talking about it like this... it does help a little.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Reliving it is hard, but I suppose it's better than trying to avoid thinking about it altogether. I just hope that one day, I can think about Mar\u00eda without feeling this crushing guilt.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's a long process, but I'm willing to keep trying. For Mar\u00eda's sake, and for mine. I want to be able to remember the good times without being overwhelmed by the trauma of that day.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling quite tired now, but I'm glad we did this. Thank you for your patience and support. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, and well done today."
