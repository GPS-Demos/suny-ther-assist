    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments as a refugee, the constant fear and uncertainty... it brings back so many emotions I've tried to bury for years.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The faces. The faces of the other refugees, especially the children. They looked so lost, so scared. It reminds me of how I felt, how vulnerable we all were. And the sound of the waves... it's like I can still hear them crashing against the boat.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... harder than I expected. I thought after all these years, it wouldn't affect me so much. But I felt that same knot in my stomach, that same tightness in my chest. It's like my body remembers even if my mind tries to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your body's reactions are important. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, my hands were shaking, just like they did back then. And I felt this overwhelming urge to run, to hide. It's silly, I know I'm safe here, but in that moment, it all felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: That's not silly at all. How do you think this connects to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it explains why I'm always on edge, always expecting the worst. Even now, at 72, in a safe country, with a stable job... I can't shake off that feeling of impending doom. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your insight. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been carrying this weight for so long, it's become a part of me. But reliving it today, as painful as it was, made me realize how much it still affects me. Maybe... maybe it's time I start dealing with it properly.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Scared, to be honest. But also... hopeful? For the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe there's a chance to move past this, to not let it control me anymore. It's terrifying, but also... liberating, in a way.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep doing this. It's hard, but I can see how it might help. And maybe... maybe I could try talking to other refugees? Share our experiences? I've been so isolated, but today made me realize we're not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. How can we support you in this?",
    "Client: Just... being here, I suppose. Knowing I have a safe space to process all of this. And maybe... some techniques to handle the anxiety when it gets overwhelming? I want to face this, but I also need to know I can cope with it.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely work on that. Anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm just grateful. For this opportunity, for your patience. I've spent so long running from my past, it's strange to finally turn and face it. It's scary, but... I think it's what I need to do.",
    "Therapist: You're showing immense strength. How do you feel about our next session?",
    "Client: Nervous, but ready. I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in years, I feel like I'm moving forward instead of just treading water. It's a good feeling."
