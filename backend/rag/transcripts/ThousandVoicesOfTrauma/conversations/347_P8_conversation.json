    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of the earthquake, they're so vivid now. I can still feel the ground shaking beneath my feet, hear the crashing of buildings... It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's this... this cold, gripping sensation in my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, you know? One moment everything was normal, and the next... chaos. I couldn't do anything to stop it or protect myself. It's... it's terrifying to remember how powerless I was.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's racing, and my palms are sweaty. There's this tightness in my throat, like I can't get enough air. And my muscles... they're so tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. It's like my body's still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not rational, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm never truly safe. And then there's this... guilt. I survived when so many others didn't. Why me? What makes me so special? It's... it's hard to reconcile.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're intense, but not as overwhelming as they were then. Back then, I couldn't function at all. I was in a constant state of panic, jumping at every little sound. Now, it's more... contained, I guess? But it still affects me deeply. I find myself avoiding tall buildings, always looking for exits... It's exhausting, living like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult, but I can do it. Before, I would've done anything to escape these memories. Drink, use drugs, anything to numb myself. But now, I can... I can acknowledge them without being completely consumed. It's uncomfortable, but I'm here, I'm present. That feels like progress, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: Proud, I think. And a little hopeful. It's like... like I'm slowly regaining control. Not over what happened, but over how I respond to it. It's empowering, in a way. But also scary. What if I can't keep it up? What if I backslide?",
    "Therapist: What helps you stay grounded in these moments?",
    "Client: Breathing, mostly. Focusing on my breath, feeling the chair beneath me, reminding myself that I'm here, now, and safe. And... and talking about it, like we're doing now. It helps to put words to these experiences, to make sense of them somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does discussing this impact your feelings about the trauma?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. On one hand, it brings everything to the surface, which is uncomfortable. But on the other, it's like... like I'm dismantling its power bit by bit. Each time we talk about it, it becomes a little less scary, a little more manageable. It's still painful, but it's not controlling me as much.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've learned that I'm... I'm stronger than I thought. I've survived not just the earthquake, but everything that came after - the nightmares, the panic attacks, the substance abuse. I'm still here, still fighting. And I've learned that it's okay to ask for help, to lean on others. That doesn't make me weak; it makes me human.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization affect your view of the future?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... cautiously optimistic, I suppose. I know recovery isn't linear, and I'll have setbacks. But for the first time in a long while, I can imagine a future where the trauma doesn't define me. Where I can live, not just survive. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on being more present in my daily life. To practice the grounding techniques we've discussed, even when I'm not actively feeling anxious or triggered. Maybe... maybe that will help me feel more in control, more connected to the world around me.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. And that... that means everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this journey together."
