    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's scary. I've spent so much time trying to avoid thinking about what happened during my deployment and then again during that earthquake. I'm not sure I'm ready to face it all head-on.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is completely understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that once I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop the flood of memories. What if I completely fall apart? I've worked so hard to keep it together, especially for my family. And what if reliving it makes everything worse instead of better?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think you might cope if those feelings arise?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. I guess I could try some of the breathing exercises we've practiced. But honestly, I'm afraid I might freeze up or have a panic attack. It's hard to predict how I'll react when I'm forced to confront those memories directly.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness of potential reactions is helpful. Let's discuss what to expect and how I'll support you.",
    "Client: Okay, that would be good. I think knowing what's coming might help me feel a bit more prepared. Can you walk me through what exactly we'll be doing? And how long will this part of the session last? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed if it goes on for too long.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll focus on one memory for about 30-45 minutes. I'll guide you through it step-by-step.",
    "Client: That sounds like a long time to be focused on such a difficult memory. How will you help me if I start to feel overwhelmed? And what if I can't make it through the whole session?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause if needed, and use grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate knowing that we can take breaks if necessary. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand why we're doing this. It's to help me process the trauma, right? To stop avoiding it and learn to cope with the memories?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. This process helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Your willingness to engage is courageous.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It doesn't feel very courageous right now, but I'm trying to remind myself that this is an important step in my recovery. I've noticed that avoiding these memories hasn't really made them go away \u2013 they still affect me, just in different ways. So maybe facing them head-on is what I need to do to start healing.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is spot-on. Are you ready to begin, or do you have any more questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just one more thing \u2013 can you remind me of some grounding techniques we could use if things get too intense? I want to make sure I have some tools at the ready.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We can use deep breathing, focus on physical sensations, or describe objects in the room.",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps. I'm feeling a mix of anxiety and determination right now. Part of me wants to run away from this, but another part knows it's necessary. I guess that's normal, right? Okay, let's do this. I'm ready to take this step, even if it's a difficult one.",
    "Therapist: Your mix of emotions is normal. Let's begin when you're comfortable. Take a deep breath."
