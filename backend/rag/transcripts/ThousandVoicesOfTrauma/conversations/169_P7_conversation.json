    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the moment you learned about the earthquake?",
    "Client: I... I was at home, watching TV. It was just a normal evening. Suddenly, the news anchor's face turned serious. They announced a massive earthquake had hit my hometown in Mexico. I felt my heart stop. My parents, my sister... they all lived there. I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I tried calling them immediately. My hands were shaking so much I could barely dial. The lines were down. I kept trying, over and over. I felt so helpless, so far away. I should have been there with them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember pacing back and forth, my mind racing with horrible scenarios. What if they were trapped? What if they were hurt? Or worse... I couldn't stop crying. I felt like I was going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: Hours passed. It felt like an eternity. Finally, I got through to my sister. She was okay, but... but... (voice breaks) our parents' house had collapsed. They couldn't find them. I felt like the world was ending. I wanted to wake up from this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I booked the first flight I could. The journey was agonizing. When I arrived, the city was in chaos. Buildings were reduced to rubble. The air was thick with dust and despair. I joined the search efforts, digging through debris with my bare hands.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Keep going.",
    "Client: We searched for days. Hope was fading. Then, on the fourth day, we found them. (starts sobbing) They were... they were gone. I collapsed right there, screaming. My sister had to pull me away. I couldn't accept it. It felt like a part of me died with them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The funeral was a blur. I felt numb, disconnected. I kept expecting to wake up, for it all to be a terrible dream. But it wasn't. They were really gone. I had to return home eventually, leave them behind. The guilt... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Coming back to my life here felt impossible. Everything reminded me of them. I couldn't work, couldn't sleep. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, reliving those moments. The sound of sirens would send me into a panic. I felt so alone, so lost without them.",
    "Therapist: You're very strong. We're almost done.",
    "Client: It's been years now, but the pain is still there. I miss them every day. Sometimes I still can't believe they're gone. I wonder if I could have done more, if I had been there... maybe things would have been different. I know it's not logical, but I can't shake the feeling.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Talking about it, reliving it... it's hard, but I think it helps. I haven't allowed myself to really go through those memories in a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
