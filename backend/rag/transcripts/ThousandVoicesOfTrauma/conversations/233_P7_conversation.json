    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene when you first learned about your wife's cancer diagnosis?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... We were sitting in the doctor's office. The walls were this sterile white color, and there was a clock ticking loudly on the wall. My wife, Sarah, was holding my hand tightly. The doctor came in with a serious look on his face...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The doctor sat down and looked at us with sympathy. He said, \"I'm sorry, but the tests show that Sarah has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.\" I felt like the air had been sucked out of the room. My ears started ringing, and I could barely hear anything else he was saying. Sarah's hand went limp in mine...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I remember looking at Sarah. Her face had gone pale, and she was staring blankly at the doctor. I wanted to say something, anything, but my mouth felt dry, and I couldn't form words. The doctor kept talking about treatment options, but it all sounded like gibberish to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I felt this overwhelming sense of helplessness. We had so many plans, you know? We were supposed to retire next year, travel the world. And suddenly, it felt like our whole future had been ripped away from us. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. This has to be a mistake.\"",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Choking up) I... I'm sorry. It's just... it's still so raw. After the doctor finished speaking, there was this heavy silence. Sarah turned to me, and I saw the fear in her eyes. She whispered, \"What are we going to do?\" And I... I didn't have an answer. For the first time in our marriage, I felt like I couldn't protect her or fix this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) As we left the office, everything felt surreal. The receptionist was smiling, people in the waiting room were chatting, and I wanted to scream at them. Didn't they know our world had just fallen apart? We got to the car, and that's when Sarah broke down. She started sobbing uncontrollably, and I held her, feeling completely useless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt... devastated. Angry. Scared. But most of all, I felt guilty. Guilty that I couldn't do anything to change this. Guilty that I was healthy while she was sick. We sat in that car for what felt like hours, just holding each other and crying. I kept thinking about all the things we might not get to do together, all the moments we'd miss...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Continue.",
    "Client: When we finally drove home, the house felt different. Empty somehow, even though nothing had changed. We sat on the couch, and Sarah looked at me and said, \"Promise me you'll be okay, no matter what happens.\" And I... I couldn't make that promise. How could I be okay without her? But I nodded anyway, because I knew that's what she needed to hear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. My chest feels tight, and I can feel that same sense of helplessness creeping in. But... I guess it's also a bit cathartic to talk about it. To remember how strong Sarah was, even in that moment. She was always the brave one.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) You know, the hardest part wasn't just the diagnosis. It was the days and weeks that followed. Watching Sarah go through treatment, seeing her struggle with side effects, and feeling like I was losing her bit by bit. Every time she smiled or laughed, I cherished it, because I didn't know how many more of those moments we'd have.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I tried to be strong for her. I took over the household chores, managed her medications, drove her to appointments. But inside, I was falling apart. I'd wait until she was asleep, then go to the garage and just... break down. I felt like I had to keep it together for her, but the weight of it all was crushing me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice cracking) The worst part was the hope. Every time a new treatment came along, we'd get our hopes up. And every time it failed, it felt like losing her all over again. I started to dread good days because I knew they wouldn't last. And I hated myself for thinking that way. I should have been grateful for every moment, but instead, I was just... terrified of the inevitable.",
    "Therapist: Your honesty is commendable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Talking about this brings it all back. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like sharing this burden makes it a bit easier to carry. I miss her so much, every day. But remembering her strength, her love... it helps. It hurts, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I... I think I need a break. This is a lot to process. But... thank you. For listening, for understanding. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here and discuss how you're feeling."
