    "Therapist: Welcome, Alice. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've talked about this, but actually facing it... it's daunting. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. *deep breath* Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm sitting on my couch, reading a book. The house is quiet, just the ticking of the clock on the wall. I can smell the lavender candle I lit earlier.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a noise. At first, I think it's just the house settling, you know? But then... there's another sound. Like... like someone's trying to force the back door open. My heart starts racing. I... I feel frozen.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's... it's getting intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. My legs feel wobbly. I'm trying to decide if I should run to the phone or hide. Then I hear it - the door bursts open. There's a crash, like something's been knocked over. Oh God, I can hear footsteps.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *voice shaking* They're coming closer. I can hear heavy breathing. I'm paralyzed with fear. I want to scream but no sound comes out. I... I can see a shadow in the hallway. It's getting bigger.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man enters the room. He's... he's tall, wearing dark clothes. I can't see his face clearly. He spots me and... and he's coming towards me. I finally find my voice and I scream. I turn to run but I trip over the coffee table.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* I... I fall hard. My elbow hits the floor and it hurts so bad. The man, he... he grabs my arm. His grip is so tight. I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm crying, begging him not to hurt me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he drags me to my feet. I'm struggling, trying to break free. I manage to elbow him in the stomach and he loosens his grip. I run towards the kitchen, thinking I can get out through the back door.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. But also... determined. I don't want to be a victim. I'm running as fast as I can, but I can hear him behind me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: I reach the kitchen. The back door is wide open. I can see the moonlight outside. I'm almost there when he grabs my hair. The pain is sharp. I cry out. He pulls me back and I lose my balance.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *taking deep breaths* I... I fall backwards. My head hits the kitchen counter. Everything goes fuzzy for a moment. I can taste blood in my mouth. The man is standing over me. I'm... I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 95. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: *breathing slowly* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The man... he starts rifling through the drawers. He's muttering to himself. I'm on the floor, my vision is blurry. I can see my phone on the counter. If I could just reach it...",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I slowly start to move my hand towards the counter. My whole body is shaking. The man has his back to me. I stretch my arm out, my fingers barely touching the edge of the counter.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to grab the phone. My heart's pounding so loud I'm sure he can hear it. I quickly dial 911 and hit call. The man turns around just as I do this. He lunges at me.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I scream. I hold the phone tight and curl into a ball. He's trying to pry it from my hands. I can hear the 911 operator's voice, but I can't speak. The man is yelling, cursing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified, but... but also hopeful. Help is coming. I just need to hold on.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there are sirens in the distance. The man freezes. He looks at me, then at the phone, then at the door. The sirens are getting louder. He... he lets go of me and runs.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: I... I stay curled up on the floor. I'm sobbing, clutching the phone. I can hear the operator asking if I'm okay. The sirens are right outside now. I hear car doors slamming, footsteps running.",
    "Therapist: You're almost through it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police burst in. They're calling out, asking if anyone's there. I try to speak but I'm crying too hard. One of them finds me in the kitchen. He kneels beside me, asks if I'm hurt.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Relieved... so relieved. But also shaken. I can't stop trembling. The officer helps me sit up. There are more people coming in - paramedics, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I'm still scared, but I know I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you describe what happens after that?",
    "Client: The paramedics check me over. They're concerned about my head injury. I'm still in shock, I think. Everything feels surreal. They want to take me to the hospital, but I don't want to leave my house.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that?",
    "Client: I... I eventually agree to go. One of the officers stays behind to secure my house. As they help me to the ambulance, I see my neighbors outside, looking worried. I feel... exposed. Vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: That must have been difficult. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering how this happened. Why me? Will I ever feel safe in my own home again? I'm angry and scared and... and so, so tired.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. Reliving it was hard, but... but I did it.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Alice. How are you feeling now that we've gone through it?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I didn't think I could get through it, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but... but maybe it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Shall we end the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm... I'm ready to come back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, open your eyes.",
    "Client: *takes deep breaths, opens eyes* Okay... I'm back.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Alice. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but okay. It's strange, reliving it is awful, but afterwards... I feel a bit stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You did great today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing this.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. Let's take a few minutes to debrief before we end the session."
