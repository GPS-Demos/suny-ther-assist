    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the police brutality incident was intense. I could almost feel the cold pavement against my face again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The shouting, the sirens... It was so loud in my head. And the feeling of helplessness. I kept thinking, \"Why me? I didn't do anything wrong.\" It's like I was reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar, actually. I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. Even when I'm just walking down the street, I feel like I could be targeted at any moment. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to share that memory today?",
    "Client: Scary at first, but... also kind of liberating? I've never really talked about it in detail before. It's like I've been carrying this heavy secret, and now it's out there. I feel vulnerable, but also a little lighter, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. What did you learn about yourself?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that, and I'm here now, trying to work through it. And maybe... maybe it wasn't my fault. I've always felt like I must have done something to deserve it, but going through it again, I can see that I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How might this change things for you?",
    "Client: I'm not sure yet. Maybe I'll be able to stop blaming myself so much. And maybe I can start to feel safer in public spaces again. It's been so long since I've felt comfortable just existing in the world, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try going for a short walk in my neighborhood without constantly looking over my shoulder. Just for a few minutes. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, honestly. But also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel. It's been so dark for so long, dealing with this on top of my depression. But I feel like I'm finally starting to make some progress.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of courage today. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep doing this. It's hard, but I can see how it might help. And maybe I could start journaling about my experiences? I've always found writing therapeutic, but I've been too scared to put these memories on paper before.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like recovery might actually be possible. It's scary, but also exciting.",
