    "Therapist: Welcome, let's begin today's imaginal exposure session. How are you feeling about starting?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. There's a part of me that wants to do this, to face it, you know? But another part is... terrified. My hands are already shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 out of 10. My heart's already racing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright... I'm... I'm at the protest. It's a warm day, the sun is beating down. There are so many people around me, all of us chanting, holding signs. I can smell sweat and hear the echoes of our voices bouncing off the buildings.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see a sea of faces, determined looks. Some people look angry, others scared. The signs... they're bobbing up and down. \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"No Justice, No Peace.\" I'm holding one too, my hands are sweaty on the cardboard.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: *voice trembles* The mood... it shifts. There's tension in the air. I hear shouting from the front of the crowd. People start pushing, jostling. I'm trying to stay upright, but it's hard. Then... then I see them. The police. They're in riot gear, advancing towards us.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is pounding so hard. I want to run, but I'm frozen. The memory of... of what happened to me as a kid... it's all mixing together. I feel small, helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I can't... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath with me. In... and out. You're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *breathes shakily* Okay... The police are getting closer. Someone next to me stumbles, and I reach out to steady them. That's when I hear it - the crack of a baton. People are screaming now. I smell something acrid - tear gas, I think. My eyes are burning.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to turn away, to get out of the crowd. But there's nowhere to go. I feel hands grabbing at me, pushing me. I can't tell if it's other protesters or the police. I'm yelling, \"Stop! Please!\" But no one's listening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: *voice breaks* A policeman grabs my arm. His grip is so tight, it hurts. I'm pleading, \"I didn't do anything!\" But he's not listening. He's pulling me, and I'm fighting against him. All I can think about is... is being touched when I was younger. I feel like I'm suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you survived this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* The officer throws me to the ground. My face scrapes against the pavement. I taste blood. He's on top of me, pressing his knee into my back. I can't move. I'm crying, begging him to stop. All around me, there's chaos. Screaming, the thud of batons, the hiss of tear gas canisters.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. I can't breathe. My mind is flashing between this moment and... and when I was abused. The feeling of being powerless, of hands on my body that I don't want. I'm so ashamed, so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is a memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone... someone is yelling at the officer. I hear a camera clicking. The pressure on my back lessens, and suddenly I can breathe again. The officer is pulling me up roughly, cuffing my hands behind my back. My shoulders ache, my face stings.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. They're leading me away, through the crowd. People are shouting, some at me, some at the police. I catch glimpses of familiar faces, looking shocked, scared. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I've failed. Like I'm that helpless kid again. I couldn't protect myself then, and I can't now. I'm angry, so angry at the police, at the world. But mostly, I'm just... ashamed. Ashamed that I froze, that I couldn't fight back.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it's not your fault. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: They put me in the back of a police van. It's dark, and I can hear other people crying, cursing. The van starts moving, and I'm thrown around. My wrists hurt from the cuffs. I'm thinking about my family, what they'll say when they find out. I'm thinking about... about my abuser, and how he made me feel this same way - trapped, helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is just a memory. What happens at the station?",
    "Client: *voice quivers* At the station, it's... it's a blur. They process me, take my fingerprints. I'm still in shock, I think. They put me in a holding cell with others from the protest. Some are injured, bleeding. I curl up in a corner, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: How long were you there?",
    "Client: Hours... it felt like days. Eventually, they let us go with a warning. When I step outside, it's dark. I feel... hollow. Empty. Like something fundamental has been taken from me.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, open your eyes and look around the room.",
    "Client: *opens eyes, looks around* I... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you're safe here. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted. Shaky. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels... stronger? Like I faced it and survived.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we discuss the experience.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah. I think I need that. This was... intense. But I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed immense courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about it like this. It's still hard, but... it feels a little less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue to work through this. For now, let's focus on some grounding exercises.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm ready."
