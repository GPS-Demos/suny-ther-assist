    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mar\u00eda?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaken, Dr. Thompson. It's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that day, when the police officers... (voice trembles) it's so vivid now. I can smell the tear gas, hear the shouting, feel the rough pavement beneath me.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you most strongly right now?",
    "Client: The fear. Dios m\u00edo, the fear is overwhelming. I remember thinking, \"This is how I die.\" I was just there to support my grandson at the protest, you know? I never imagined... (pauses, takes a deep breath) I keep seeing the officer's face, so angry, so... inhuman. And feeling so helpless, like a rag doll being thrown around.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness, Dr. Thompson. Like my limbs are made of lead. I feel small, insignificant. My stomach is in knots, and there's this... this lump in my throat that won't go away. It's hard to breathe sometimes, remembering how they pinned me down.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me? Why us?\" We were peaceful. My grandson, he's such a good boy, fighting for what's right. And then I think about my own parents, how they came here for a better life. Is this what they dreamed of for their daughter? To be treated like... like we're not even human? (voice breaks) It makes me so angry, but also... so sad.",
    "Therapist: How do you experience that mix of anger and sadness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a storm inside me, Dr. Thompson. The anger feels hot, like it could burst out of me at any moment. But the sadness, it's... it's deeper, colder. It makes me want to curl up and hide from the world. Sometimes I feel guilty for being angry, like I should just be grateful it wasn't worse. But then I remember my grandson's face when they... (trails off, sniffles)",
    "Therapist: What do you notice as you remember your grandson?",
    "Client: Oh, Dr. Thompson, my heart just breaks. He looked so scared, so... betrayed. He's always believed in justice, in doing what's right. To see that faith shattered... (wipes tears) I feel this fierce need to protect him, but also this... this crushing realization that I couldn't. That I can't, not from this.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... powerless. Like I've failed as a grandmother, as a protector. But it also makes me want to fight harder, you know? To make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else's grandchild. It's exhausting, though. I'm not as young as I used to be, and some days, the fear just... it paralyzes me.",
    "Therapist: What helps you push through that fear?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) My family, I suppose. My husband, my children, my grandchildren. They give me strength. And... and talking about it, like this. It's hard, Dios m\u00edo, it's so hard. But each time, it's like... like I'm reclaiming a piece of myself. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How do you feel now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. The memories are still there, still painful, but they feel... I don't know, less overwhelming? I'm grateful for this space, Dr. Thompson. To be heard, to be believed... it means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Mar\u00eda. What would you like to focus on in our remaining time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk about coping strategies. For when the memories hit hard, you know? Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in them, and I... I need to learn how to swim.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Let's explore some techniques..."
