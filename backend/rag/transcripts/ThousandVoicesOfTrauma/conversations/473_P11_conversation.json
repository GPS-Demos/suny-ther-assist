    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that memory of witnessing the violence at my old workplace. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most about the experience today?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it was how vivid everything felt. I could almost smell the coffee from the break room mixed with the metallic scent of blood. And the sounds... the shouting, the crash of furniture being overturned. It was like I was right back there again. I didn't expect it to feel so... real.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. I felt this overwhelming sense of helplessness, you know? Like I was frozen in place, unable to do anything. And there was this guilt too, like maybe I should have done more to help. But at the same time, I know logically that there wasn't much I could have done without putting myself in danger.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences now?",
    "Client: I guess... well, I've been having trouble feeling safe at work lately. Even though I'm at a new job now, I'm always on high alert, always watching the door, always planning escape routes. It's exhausting. And I think it's tied to that feeling of helplessness from that day.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I realized that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Even though it was hard, I made it through the exposure without falling apart. And I'm starting to see how avoiding these memories hasn't really been helping me. It's just been keeping me stuck.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to stop running from these memories. Maybe if I face them head-on, they'll lose some of their power over me. And I want to work on feeling safer in my day-to-day life. Maybe I can start by reminding myself that what happened then isn't happening now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How can we support that in our next session?",
    "Client: Could we maybe... I don't know, work on some grounding techniques? Something to help me stay present when the memories start to feel overwhelming? And maybe we could talk more about how to manage my anxiety at work. I want to feel like I can do my job without constantly being on guard.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also kind of relieved? Like I've taken a step forward, even if it was a difficult one. And I'm... I'm proud of myself for getting through it. Is that okay to say?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You should be proud. What else?",
    "Client: I'm also feeling a bit more hopeful. Like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel, you know? It's still dim and far away, but at least I can see it now. And that's... that's something to hold onto.",
    "Therapist: That's great, John. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to make some progress. And even though it's scary, I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows your commitment. Ready to end for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm pretty drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like after a really intense workout. I'm going to go home and just try to relax for the rest of the day. Maybe do some of those breathing exercises we talked about last time.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Take care, John. See you next week.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. See you then."
