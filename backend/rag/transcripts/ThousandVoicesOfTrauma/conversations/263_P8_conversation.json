    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also frozen at the same time. The memory of that accident, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of tires, the shattering glass. My heart's pounding, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the adrenaline coursing through my body, just like it did that day. My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying those feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"I could have died.\" It's on repeat in my head. And then I think about all the things I could have missed out on. My kids growing up, my career... It's overwhelming. But then there's this other voice, telling me I'm being ridiculous for still feeling this way after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How do those conflicting thoughts impact you?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel confused and guilty. Like, shouldn't I be over this by now? But then I remember how close I came to... to not being here anymore. It's exhausting, this back-and-forth in my mind. Sometimes I just want to shut it all off, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're practically up to my ears. And my breathing... I just realized it's really shallow. I feel like I can't get enough air. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, even though I'm sitting here safe in this room.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: As I breathe, I... I notice this sense of vulnerability. It's like the accident stripped away this illusion of control I had over my life. And that connects to so many other areas. My divorce, my job stresses... it all feels so precarious now. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a hint of strength? Like, I survived that, so maybe I can handle more than I think.",
    "Therapist: How does that hint of strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... unfamiliar. Almost uncomfortable. But also kind of comforting? It's like a tiny spark in all this darkness. I've spent so long focusing on how the accident broke me, I never really considered how it might have... I don't know, fortified me in some way?",
    "Therapist: Interesting. Can you explore that a bit more?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... surviving something like that, it changes your perspective. I used to get so worked up over small things, you know? But now, I find myself thinking, \"At least I'm here to experience this frustration.\" It's a strange sort of gratitude. Don't get me wrong, I still struggle with anxiety, especially in cars. But there's this underlying awareness that I'm resilient, even when I don't feel like it.",
    "Therapist: How does this awareness affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Some days, it helps me push through the anxiety. I'll remind myself, \"You've faced worse, you can handle this.\" But other times, it almost makes things harder. Like, I feel this pressure to always be strong because I survived, and that can be exhausting. And then there's the guilt...",
    "Therapist: Tell me more about the guilt.",
    "Client: It's... it's this nagging feeling that I shouldn't complain or struggle because I'm lucky to be alive. I know it's not rational, but it's there. And it ties into my anxiety about human trafficking too. I mean, here I am, alive and free, while so many others are suffering. It makes me feel... I don't know, almost unworthy of my own struggles?",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these complex emotions?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not always well. Sometimes I throw myself into work, trying to distract myself. Other times, I isolate, which I know isn't healthy. But lately, I've been trying to... to sit with the discomfort. To acknowledge these feelings without judging them. It's hard, really hard. But moments like this, talking it through, it helps make sense of the chaos in my head.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... a mix of things. There's still that undercurrent of anxiety, but also a sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? Not in a boastful way, but just in recognizing how far I've come. The fact that I can sit here and talk about this without completely falling apart, that's something, right? And there's a part of me that feels... hopeful? Like maybe I can learn to navigate these complex emotions better over time.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth in my chest. My breathing feels a bit easier, and my shoulders have dropped a little. It's not overwhelming, but it's there. And it's... it's nice. It's like a reminder that I'm not just my trauma or my anxiety. I'm also capable of growth and healing.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to hold onto this feeling of hope. To remember that healing isn't linear, and that's okay. And maybe to be a little kinder to myself when the anxiety hits. To recognize that my feelings are valid, even if they're complicated. And to keep pushing forward, even when it's hard. Because if I can survive a car accident and sit here talking about it, maybe I can handle whatever else life throws my way.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way? Like I've done some heavy emotional lifting. There's still some residual anxiety, but it feels more manageable now. And there's this sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I understand myself a little better after this conversation. It's not easy, facing these memories and feelings, but I think it's important. And I'm... I'm grateful for the space to do it.",
    "Therapist: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I don't think so. This has been... intense, but valuable. I feel like I've unpacked a lot today. There's still work to do, of course, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. I'm curious to see how I'll process all of this in the coming days. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. Take care."
