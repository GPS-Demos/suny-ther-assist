    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into that incident with the police, and just thinking about it makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. As ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking down the street. It's late afternoon, the sun's starting to set. I can hear traffic in the distance, but this particular street is quiet. I'm on my way home from the grocery store, carrying a couple of bags.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see a police car slow down next to me. At first, I think nothing of it, but then it stops. Two officers get out. They're approaching me, and I'm confused. I haven't done anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's starting to race. I'm... I'm getting nervous. Why are they coming towards me?",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Maybe... 40? It's climbing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: They're asking for my ID. I'm fumbling with my grocery bags, trying to reach my wallet. One of the officers seems impatient. He's... he's reaching for my arm. I flinch, and suddenly, everything escalates.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening?",
    "Client: The officer grabs my arm roughly. I'm startled, and I drop my groceries. The other officer is yelling at me to stop resisting, but I'm not! I'm just scared and confused. They're... they're pushing me against the police car now.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding so hard. I can barely breathe. My arms hurt where they're gripping me. I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70, maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... The officers are handcuffing me now. It's so tight, it hurts. I'm trying to explain that I haven't done anything, but they're not listening. One of them is reading me my rights, but I can barely hear him over the blood rushing in my ears.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Why me? What did I do wrong?\" I'm scared they're going to hurt me more. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: They're putting me in the back of the police car now. I can see people on the street watching. I feel so humiliated. My groceries are scattered on the sidewalk. I... I start crying. I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take another deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: We're driving to the police station. I'm in the back, still handcuffed. My wrists are aching. I keep asking what I've done, but they're ignoring me. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you experiencing in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I'm sweating, but I feel cold at the same time. My hands are shaking. I... I can't stop trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with it.",
    "Client: At the station, they take my fingerprints and photo. I feel like a criminal, but I haven't done anything wrong. They keep asking me questions about a robbery in the area. I tell them over and over that I don't know anything about it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. And scared. And so, so confused. Why won't they believe me?",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still around 85. Maybe even 90.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a few deep breaths* Okay... They've put me in a holding cell now. It's cold and stark. I can hear other people in nearby cells. I'm... I'm terrified. I've never been in trouble with the law before. I don't know what's going to happen to me.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how this will affect my life. Will I lose my job? What will my friends and family think? I feel so... so ashamed, even though I know I didn't do anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that this wasn't your fault. How long were you in the cell?",
    "Client: It felt like forever, but I think it was about four hours. Eventually, another officer came and told me they'd made a mistake. They'd arrested the actual suspect elsewhere. They... they just let me go. Just like that.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel when they released you?",
    "Client: I was... I was relieved, but also furious. They didn't even apologize properly. They just handed me my things and told me I was free to go. I felt... I felt violated. Humiliated. Like my rights meant nothing to them.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling now, as you recall all of this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a little. My heart's still racing. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced this memory and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step, Sarah. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to about 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done really well today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the plant in the corner, your desk, the clock on the wall, the painting of the ocean, and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The couch I'm sitting on, my jacket, my hair, and... the smooth surface of my watch.",
    "Therapist: Great. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, some muffled voices from outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of your air freshener, and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: Perfect. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling more centered. More present. My heart's not racing as much anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. You've shown incredible strength today, Sarah. How do you feel about the work we've done?",
    "Client: It was really hard, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. Like I'm not letting this experience control me as much anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You're reclaiming your power. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For guiding me through this. For helping me face this memory. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I can do this now.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Sarah. You've done the hard work here. I'm just here to support you. Is there anything you'd like to focus on for our next session?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on some strategies for dealing with the anxiety I still feel when I see police officers? I know not all of them are bad, but I still get really tense.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. We'll definitely address that next time. For now, I want you to remember how strong you've been today. You faced a very difficult memory and came out the other side. Be kind to yourself this week, okay?",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. I'll see you next week. Take care."
