    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about the cyber bullying brings up a lot of emotions. It's like my heart is racing already.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My palms are sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the event as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... I'm sitting at my desk, working on a project for my business. My phone buzzes. It's a notification from social media. I pick it up and... oh god, my stomach drops. There's a comment on my latest post. It's... it's vile. They're calling me horrible names, saying my work is worthless. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. The words are swimming on the screen. \"Fraud,\" \"talentless,\" \"go back to where you came from.\" My hands are shaking. I want to throw the phone, but I can't look away. More notifications. It's not just one comment anymore. There are dozens, hundreds. They're tearing apart everything I've worked for.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I scroll through the comments. Each one feels like a punch to the gut. They're attacking my race, my gender, my business. Someone's posted personal information about me. My address. Oh god, they know where I live. I'm trembling all over. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I can't... I can't stop reading. It's like I'm paralyzed. My eyes are burning with tears, but I can't cry. I feel numb and overwhelmed at the same time. I want to defend myself, but what's the point? There are so many of them. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: Remember you're here now, in a safe place. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My... my shoulders are so tense. It's hard to swallow. I feel like I'm going to be sick. The room is spinning a little. I close my laptop, but I can still hear the notifications on my phone. It won't stop. They won't stop.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) I... I call my husband. My voice is shaking so much I can barely speak. He rushes home, but it feels like hours. I'm curled up on the floor, hugging my knees. I can't stop shaking. When he gets here, I just... I just break down. I'm sobbing uncontrollably. I feel so ashamed, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe. What happened after your husband arrived?",
    "Client: He... he holds me. I can barely breathe through the sobs. I keep saying \"They hate me. They all hate me.\" He's trying to comfort me, but I can't hear him over the roaring in my ears. I feel like I'm drowning. Everything I've worked for, everything I am... it feels like it's crumbling away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I can't stop crying. My chest hurts. I feel so small, so insignificant. The comments keep replaying in my head. \"Worthless,\" \"stupid,\" \"go kill yourself.\" I... I start to wonder if they're right. Maybe I am a fraud. Maybe I should just give up.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) I... I'm trying. My husband is talking to me, but I can't focus on his words. All I can hear are those hateful comments. I feel like I'm falling apart. I don't know who I am anymore. Everything feels... tainted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally look at my husband. His face is so worried. It makes me feel even worse, like I'm letting him down too. He suggests we call the police, but I feel too ashamed. What if they don't take it seriously? What if they blame me somehow? I just shake my head and cry more.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My head is pounding. I feel hollow inside. The comments are still there, still coming, but I can't look anymore. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. I feel so raw, so exposed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I let my husband lead me to bed. I'm trembling all over. He brings me some water, but I can barely drink it. My throat feels so tight. I curl up under the blankets, trying to hide from the world. But I can't escape my own thoughts. They're racing, replaying every horrible comment. I feel so stupid for putting myself out there, for thinking I could succeed.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. What are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My... my muscles are so tense. My jaw hurts from clenching it. I feel nauseous. Every time I close my eyes, I see those comments. I can't escape them. I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of all that hate.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: (takes a shuddering breath) I... I can't sleep. I keep reaching for my phone, then stopping myself. Part of me wants to fight back, to defend myself. But I'm terrified of making it worse. What if they come after my family next? I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I start thinking about my business. All the work I've put into it. Will I have to shut it down? Will anyone ever trust me again? I feel like my whole identity is slipping away. Who am I if not this? The thought makes me start crying again. I can't seem to stop.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7. I feel so drained, but I can't relax.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The... the night feels endless. I drift in and out of sleep, but every time I wake up, the reality hits me all over again. My husband tries to comfort me, but I feel so distant from him. I'm embarrassed that he's seeing me like this. I feel like I've let everyone down.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: As... as morning comes, I feel almost worse. The adrenaline has worn off, and I just feel... empty. Hollow. I can't face getting up, facing the world. What if people on the street recognize me? What if they're thinking those same horrible things? I feel like I can never show my face in public again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My head is pounding. My eyes are swollen from crying. I feel like I've been hit by a truck. The fear and shame are still there, but they're duller now. I just feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now. I still feel shaky, but the intensity has faded.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Sarah. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm here. In your office. I'm safe. It... it helps to talk about it, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It feels good to have shared this with someone who understands. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end our session here and discuss some coping strategies for the coming week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed this more than I realized.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. We'll continue to work through this together."
