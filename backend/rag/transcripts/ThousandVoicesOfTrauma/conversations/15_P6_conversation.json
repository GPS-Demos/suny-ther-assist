    "Therapist: Okay, Carlos, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm back in the hospital waiting room. The fluorescent lights are so bright, and there's that antiseptic smell. I can hear the beeping of machines in the distance. My hands are shaking as I wait for the doctor to come out with my test results.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The doctor finally comes out. His face is serious, and my heart starts racing. He says, \"Mr. Rodriguez, I'm afraid I have some bad news.\" I feel like the floor is dropping out from under me. My mouth goes dry, and I can barely hear him over the rushing sound in my ears.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's alright. Keep going.",
    "Client: He tells me I have a rare form of cancer. I'm in shock. All I can think about is my family, my kids. How am I going to tell them? I feel so alone in that moment, even though the waiting room is full of people. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I stumble out of the hospital, barely able to see straight. I get to my car and just sit there, unable to move. I feel like my whole world has shattered. I'm terrified of what's to come - the treatments, the pain, the possibility of... of not making it. I start sobbing uncontrollably in the car.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember calling my wife, barely able to get the words out. Her voice breaks when I tell her, and I feel this crushing guilt for putting her through this. I'm angry at my body for betraying me, scared of what this means for our future. I feel so helpless and out of control.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: As I drive home, everything looks different. The world seems darker, scarier. I keep thinking about my kids growing up without me. I'm terrified of leaving them, of not being there for the important moments in their lives. I feel like I've let everyone down somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: I get home, and my wife is waiting. She hugs me, and I just break down again. But there's also this tiny spark of determination. I decide right then that I'm going to fight this with everything I have. For my family, for myself.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. Remembering my resolve helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. Well done today."
