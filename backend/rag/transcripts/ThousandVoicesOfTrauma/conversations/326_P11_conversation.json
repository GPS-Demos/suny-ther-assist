    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Amiri?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Reliving that hostage situation... it's like I was right back there in that bank. I can still hear the shouting, the crying... (takes a deep breath) My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was paralyzing. I remember thinking about my children, wondering if I'd ever see them again. And the helplessness... feeling so out of control. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling, even now.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge now. Even at work, I'm constantly checking exits, watching people's movements. It's exhausting. And sometimes, I just want to stay home where it feels safe.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to revisit the memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... (pauses) I think it was also different this time. I felt more... present? Like I could observe it without being completely overwhelmed. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think contributed to that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe it's because we've been working on this for a while now? I don't know, I just felt a bit stronger facing it. Still scared, but... stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I want to feel safe again, to enjoy life without constantly looking over my shoulder. This... this gives me hope that maybe I can get there. It's like, if I can face the memory, maybe I can face real-life situations better too.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: I... I also noticed that the worst part, the most intense fear, it didn't last as long as I remembered. It peaked and then... it started to subside. I never realized that before.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that change things for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting, in a way. Like, maybe when I'm feeling anxious or scared in daily life, I can remind myself that it won't last forever. That it will pass.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to push myself a little more in situations I've been avoiding. Like, maybe I can try going to the mall again. And if I start feeling panicky, I can remind myself that it will pass, just like in the memory.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great strategy. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's still scary, and part of me wants to avoid it. But... I can see how it's helping. I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I'm tired of letting fear control me.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. What else would you like to share?",
    "Client: I... I'm grateful. For this process, for your guidance. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. And... (voice breaking) I'm proud of myself. I never thought I could face this, but I am.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful sentiment. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Really good. Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe... maybe I can get through this after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful realization. Is there anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful. And that means everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your progress is truly commendable. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. This was intense, but... I'm glad we did it. I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've taken a step forward. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Take care, Mrs. Amiri.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. See you next week."
