    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the hurricane, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the day of the hurricane.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... It's early morning, and the sky is this eerie, dark gray. The wind is already picking up, and I can hear it whistling through the cracks in my apartment windows. I'm alone, and I'm scared because I don't know what's going to happen.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see trees bending outside, their branches whipping around wildly. The rain is starting to come down in sheets, pelting against the windows. It's so loud, like a constant roar. I'm pacing back and forth, checking my phone for updates, but the signal keeps cutting out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, and my hands are shaking. I keep trying to take deep breaths, but it feels like I can't get enough air. The power flickers, and I jump. God, I hate this feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: The... the power goes out completely. It's suddenly so dark, and the howling of the wind seems even louder now. I fumble for my flashlight, and I knock something over. The crash makes me yelp, and I feel so stupid, so childish. I'm 25, for crying out loud, I shouldn't be this scared!",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. Keep going.",
    "Client: I decide to hunker down in my bathroom \u2013 it's the only room without windows. I grab some blankets, my phone, and a bottle of water. As I'm settling in, I hear this horrible cracking sound from outside. My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about an 8, I think.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe now. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Okay... I'm sitting on the bathroom floor, wrapped in a blanket. The noise outside is deafening \u2013 wind, rain, things crashing. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they're okay. I feel so alone, so isolated. It's like the whole world has been reduced to this tiny bathroom and the chaos outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: Hours pass, I think. It's hard to keep track of time. My phone battery is dying, and I'm terrified of being left in complete darkness. I start... I start having flashbacks to... to the abuse. The feeling of being trapped, helpless. I can't stop shaking. I want to scream, but I'm afraid if I start, I won't be able to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *voice quivering* I... I curl up tighter, trying to make myself as small as possible. There's a moment when the wind dies down a little, and in that brief silence, I can hear my own ragged breathing. It sounds so loud, so desperate. I realize I've been crying, my face is wet with tears.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this room?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart's racing a bit, but I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* The storm seems to last forever. Every crash, every gust of wind makes me flinch. I keep thinking about how exposed I am, how easily the roof could come off, how quickly I could be... gone. It brings back memories of feeling helpless during the abuse, and I hate how similar the feelings are.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing these memories. What happens as the storm begins to subside?",
    "Client: Slowly, very slowly, the wind starts to die down. The rain becomes less intense. I'm exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I cautiously open the bathroom door, half expecting to see my apartment in ruins. But it's just dark and quiet. I make my way to a window and peer out.",
    "Therapist: What do you see?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a war zone. Trees are down everywhere, debris scattered across the street. Some cars have their windows smashed. It's still raining lightly, but the worst seems to be over. I feel this weird mix of relief and dread \u2013 relief that I survived, but dread at what I might find outside.",
    "Therapist: How does that dread feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight in my chest. My shoulders are tense, and I realize I've been clenching my jaw. I'm exhausted, but I can't relax. Part of me is still waiting for the next disaster to hit.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I try to call my family, but the lines are still down. I feel so isolated, cut off from everyone. I want to go outside, to see if anyone needs help, but I'm scared of what I might find. I sit by the window, watching as a few people emerge from their homes, looking shell-shocked.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing others make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like I'm not alone in this. But it also makes the reality of what just happened sink in. This isn't just my nightmare anymore \u2013 it's affected everyone. I feel guilty for being so focused on my own fear when others might have lost everything.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to focus on your own survival in a crisis. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit... maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As the day goes on, more people come out. Neighbors start checking on each other. Someone I barely know offers me some bottled water. It's a small gesture, but it nearly makes me break down crying. I realize how touch-starved I feel, how much I crave human connection after feeling so isolated.",
    "Therapist: How does that connection impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. In a good way, I think. It reminds me that even though terrible things happen, there's still kindness in the world. It makes me think about the people who helped me after the abuse, how their support meant everything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel as the day comes to an end?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but there's this underlying feeling of... I don't know, resilience maybe? Like I've been through something terrible, but I'm still here. The fear isn't gone, but it's not consuming me anymore. I keep thinking about how I survived both the hurricane and the abuse, and maybe that means I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How are you feeling now, back in this room?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a little proud. Talking about it was hard, but I did it. My heart's not racing as much anymore.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think it's down to about a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you. This was tough, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. We'll continue to work through this in our next session."
