    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory we're focusing on today?",
    "Client: Okay... It's about the night my ex-husband and I had our worst fight. It was about two years ago, just before our divorce. We were in the kitchen, and he had been drinking...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He was angry because I had been talking to a male coworker at a company event earlier that day. He accused me of cheating, which wasn't true at all. I tried to explain, but he wouldn't listen. His face was red, and he kept getting closer to me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I can smell the alcohol on his breath. My heart is racing, and I feel trapped against the kitchen counter. He's yelling, calling me names, and I'm trying not to cry...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, he slams his fist on the counter next to me. I flinch, and he laughs, saying I'm pathetic. I want to run, but I'm frozen. Then... then he grabs my arm, twisting it...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It hurts so much. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. I'm begging him to let go, but he just squeezes harder. I'm so scared he's going to break my arm...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I manage to push him away with my free hand, and he stumbles back. For a moment, I think it's over, but then he lunges at me again. This time, he grabs my hair and yanks my head back. I cry out in pain...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel angry and scared. My scalp is burning, and I can't believe this is happening. I want to fight back, but I'm afraid he'll hurt me even more...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I try to twist away, but he's too strong. He's shouting in my face, telling me I'm worthless, that no one will ever want me. I can feel tears streaming down my cheeks, and I'm gasping for air...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Suddenly, I hear a noise outside. It's my neighbor coming home. My ex-husband freezes, then lets go of me. He backs away, warning me not to say anything. I'm shaking, holding onto the counter to stay upright...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: I feel... relieved that it stopped, but also ashamed and angry. I hate that I felt so helpless, that I couldn't defend myself. I'm furious that he could do this to me...",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're doing great expressing them.",
    "Client: After he left, I just slid down to the floor and cried. I felt so alone and scared. I kept thinking about how I ended up in this situation, how I let it get this far...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're very strong for sharing this.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) I know that now, but at that moment, I felt like I had failed. It took me days to gather the courage to tell my sister what happened. She helped me leave him and file for divorce...",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I know it's part of healing. I'm glad I'm not in that situation anymore, even though the memories still hurt.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
