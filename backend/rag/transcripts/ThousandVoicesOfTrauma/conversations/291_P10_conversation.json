    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. My stomach feels like it's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Just... give me a moment to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. The fluorescent lights are so harsh, and there's that antiseptic smell everywhere. My mom is sitting next to me, but she's not saying anything. We're both just... waiting.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are other people in the waiting room. Some look worried, others are trying to distract themselves with magazines. The receptionist is typing away at her computer. I can hear the soft beeping of machines in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I can't stop fidgeting. I keep looking at the clock on the wall, willing it to move faster. Every minute feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if he doesn't make it?\" My dad... he had a heart attack. It was so sudden. One minute we were having dinner, and the next... *voice breaks* I can't lose him. I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Fatima. Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: A doctor comes out. He looks serious, and I feel my stomach drop. He asks for the family of Mahmoud Karim. My mom and I stand up, and I'm shaking so badly I can barely walk.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* The doctor leads us to a small room. I hate these rooms \u2013 they always mean bad news. He starts talking about my dad's condition, using words I don't fully understand. Something about blocked arteries and emergency procedures.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I feel helpless. Angry. Why is this happening to us? My mom is crying silently next to me, and I'm trying to be strong for her, but I'm falling apart inside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor says they need to perform emergency surgery. He's explaining the risks, but all I can think about is my dad lying there, alone and scared. I want to see him, but they won't let us.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: We have to sign some papers. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold the pen. It feels like I'm signing my dad's life away. What if something goes wrong? What if this is the last decision I'll ever make for him?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My mouth is dry. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up. The room feels too small, too hot. I want to run, but I can't leave my mom.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Fatima. Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay. After we sign the papers, they take my dad into surgery. We're left in the waiting room again. The clock on the wall seems to mock us. Every tick feels like it's counting down to something terrible.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm praying. Bargaining. Promising to be a better daughter if he just makes it through this. I'm remembering all the times I've disappointed him, all the arguments we've had. What if I never get to make things right?",
    "Therapist: How long does this waiting last?",
    "Client: It feels like forever. Hours pass. My mom is silent, just staring at the floor. I try to distract myself by counting tiles, reading every poster on the wall. Anything to keep from imagining the worst.",
    "Therapist: And then what happens?",
    "Client: Finally, the doctor comes back. My heart stops. I can't breathe. I'm trying to read his expression, but it's neutral. He sits down across from us, and I brace myself for the worst news of my life.",
    "Therapist: What does he say?",
    "Client: He... he says the surgery was successful. My dad made it through. I feel this rush of relief so intense it's almost painful. I start crying, and I can't stop. It's like all the fear and tension is pouring out of me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Grateful. But also... scared. What if it happens again? What if next time we're not so lucky?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts to have. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. I feel drained, but also lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job, Fatima. How are you feeling about the exposure?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Reliving it all. But I think... I think it helped. Like I'm starting to process it instead of just avoiding the memories.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um, your desk lamp, the blue chair, the painting on the wall, the bookshelf, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of my chair, my necklace, the fabric of my jeans, and... my hair.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, cars outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you smell?",
    "Client: Your coffee and... maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. My SUDS is probably around 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Fatima. You've shown incredible strength today. How do you feel about continuing these exposures in our future sessions?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It was hard, but I can see how it might help in the long run. I think I'm ready to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll continue at your pace. For now, let's talk about some coping strategies you can use between sessions when memories come up.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I could definitely use some tools to help me manage when I'm not here.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's start with..."
