    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a little tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: I'm at the grocery store. It's a busy Saturday afternoon. I'm in the produce section, picking out some apples. Suddenly, I hear shouting from the next aisle. My heart starts racing a bit as I turn to look.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see two men arguing loudly. One of them is holding a bottle of wine. Oh God, he's raising it like he's going to hit the other guy. I feel frozen, like I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I feel a lump in my throat.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man swings the bottle, but the other guy ducks. There's a loud crash as the bottle hits a shelf. Glass and wine go everywhere. People are screaming and running. I can't seem to move my feet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My heart is pounding so hard, and I feel dizzy. I'm scared they'll come towards me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Remember, you're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I finally manage to move. I abandon my cart and start heading for the exit. But I'm shaking so much, I can barely walk straight. I keep looking back, terrified they're following me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. I'm almost at the door now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I push through the doors and stumble into the parking lot. The fresh air hits me, but I still feel panicky. I fumble for my keys, dropping them twice before I can unlock my car. I practically fall into the driver's seat.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I'm sitting there, trembling. I can't stop replaying the scene in my head. My SUDS is down to a 7, but I still feel really shaken up.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: It's weird. I'm at about a 5 now. My heart's still racing, but I feel... I don't know, almost relieved to have talked about it?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* That helps a bit. I didn't realize how much this memory still affected me.",
