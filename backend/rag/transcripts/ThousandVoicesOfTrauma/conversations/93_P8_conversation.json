    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart is pounding, and I feel a bit dizzy. The memories... they're so vivid now. I can still hear the explosions, smell the smoke. It's like I'm right back there in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about the people we couldn't save. Their faces, their cries for help. It's overwhelming. My hands are shaking, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why did I survive when others didn't?\" And then I feel ashamed for even having that thought. I should be grateful, right? But instead, I feel this crushing weight of responsibility. Like I owe it to those who didn't make it to do something meaningful with my life. But most days, I can barely get out of bed. It's just... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experiences outside of combat?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. In everything I do. When I hear a car backfire, I'm instantly back there. When I see children playing, I think of the families torn apart. Even in my relationships... or lack thereof. I push people away because I don't want them to see this broken version of me. And the sexual abuse from my childhood... it all feels tangled up together. Like I was never safe, not even before the military.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. Especially in my shoulders and jaw. I realize I'm clenching my fists. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I feel... small. Like I want to curl up into a ball and disappear. It's hard to look at you directly. I feel exposed, vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How does this vulnerability feel different from during the trauma?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as terrifying. Back then, vulnerability meant death. Here, it's uncomfortable, but... maybe necessary? I don't know. Part of me wants to run away, but another part feels a tiny bit of relief. Like maybe I don't have to carry this alone anymore. But then I feel guilty for burdening you with this. It's a constant back-and-forth in my mind.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to allow yourself to share this burden?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's scary. I've been alone with this for so long. The idea of someone else knowing the full extent of it... it makes me feel both hopeful and terrified. What if you think less of me? What if you can't handle it? But also... what if it helps? What if it's the first step towards feeling human again? I want that so badly, but I'm afraid to hope.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a tiny warm spot in my chest. Just a flicker, really. But it's there. For the first time in a long while, I feel something other than numbness or pain. It's fragile, though. I'm afraid if I acknowledge it too much, it'll disappear. But it's there, and that's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to nurture that feeling?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not weak for struggling. Maybe... maybe some guidance on how to keep moving forward? I'm so tired of feeling stuck. And... I guess I need to know that you'll be here, that you won't give up on me even when things get tough. Because they will get tough, won't they?",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a strength. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, my breathing is getting a bit easier. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. I feel... I don't know, maybe a little more grounded? Like I'm starting to come back to the present. The memories are still there, but they're not as overwhelming. Is this... is this what progress feels like?",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing this progress impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me wants to dismiss it, to say it's not real or it won't last. But another part feels a spark of something... maybe pride? Is that okay to feel? I've been so focused on survival for so long, the idea of actually healing seems almost foreign. But if this is what it feels like... maybe I can do this. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: What would embracing that strength look like?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it means being a little kinder to myself? Acknowledging that what I went through was real and traumatic, but that it doesn't define me entirely. Perhaps it means allowing myself to reach out for help more often, even when it's scary. And maybe... maybe it means starting to think about the future again. Not just surviving day to day, but actually living. That's terrifying, but also... exciting? Is it okay to feel excited?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to give yourself permission to feel excited?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Like I'm taking back a piece of myself that I thought was lost forever. There's still fear there, definitely. And guilt - like, do I deserve to feel excited when so many others can't? But underneath all that, there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe my life isn't over, maybe there's still good things ahead. It's scary to hope, but it also feels... necessary. Like I can't keep living in the past if I want to move forward.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take to nurture this feeling?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I could start a journal. Just writing down one thing each day that I'm grateful for or that gives me hope. It doesn't have to be big. Maybe just the taste of my morning coffee, or a kind word from a stranger. Just something to remind me that life isn't all darkness. And maybe... maybe I could try reaching out to an old friend. Not to talk about all of this heavy stuff, but just to reconnect. To remind myself that I'm still part of the world.",
    "Therapist: How does setting these intentions make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, honestly. There's some anxiety, like what if I can't follow through? What if I disappoint myself? But there's also a sense of... purpose, I guess? Like I'm taking an active role in my healing instead of just being a passive victim. It feels empowering, even if it's scary. And there's a part of me that feels proud for even considering these steps. Is that okay? To feel proud of something so small?",
    "Therapist: What do you think? Is it okay?",
    "Client: I... I think it is. Or at least, I want it to be. These may seem like small steps to others, but for me, they feel monumental. And maybe that's okay. Maybe part of healing is recognizing and celebrating these small victories. It's hard to shake the feeling that I should be doing more, healing faster. But when I really think about it, I've come a long way from where I was. Maybe it's time I acknowledged that.",
    "Therapist: How might this acknowledgment shape your path forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think it could be transformative. If I can learn to recognize and appreciate my progress, no matter how small, it might give me the strength to keep going. To keep trying, even on the hard days. It might help me be more patient with myself, more compassionate. And maybe, just maybe, it could help me start to rebuild my sense of self-worth. Not based on what I've been through or what I've accomplished, but simply on the fact that I'm here, I'm trying, and that's enough. Is that... is that a healthy way to look at it?",
    "Therapist: What does your inner voice tell you?",
    "Client: My inner voice... it's conflicted. There's still a part of me that wants to dismiss all of this, to say I'm being too soft on myself. But there's another voice, a quieter one, that's saying this is exactly what I need. That healing isn't about being tough or pushing through, but about being gentle with myself and recognizing my own resilience. And the more I listen to that voice, the more right it feels. It's scary to trust it, but... I think I want to. I think I need to.",
    "Therapist: As we wrap up, what's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this feeling. This tiny spark of hope, this sense that maybe things can get better. It's fragile, and I know there will be setbacks, but it's real. And it's mine. No matter what happens, I've felt this moment of possibility, and that's something no one can take away from me. Is that... is that a good thing to hold onto?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I think it is. It feels right. It feels like something I can build on. Thank you for helping me find this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. And that... that means everything.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness today. We'll continue next session."
