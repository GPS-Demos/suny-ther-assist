    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about diving into this again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Yeah, thanks. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time, about the police brutality incident I witnessed. It's been weighing on me.",
    "Therapist: I see. Are you ready to explore that memory further?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it brings up a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. So, I was walking home from work, it was late evening. I heard shouting coming from an alley. When I looked, I saw two police officers confronting a young Black man. At first, I thought it was just a routine stop, but then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The situation escalated so quickly. One officer grabbed the man's arm, twisting it behind his back. The man cried out in pain, saying he hadn't done anything wrong. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can still hear his screams. The other officer started hitting him with a baton. I wanted to help, but I was terrified. I felt so powerless, just like when I was bullied as a kid.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The man fell to the ground, and they just kept hitting him. I could see blood on the pavement. I wanted to look away, but I couldn't. It was like my feet were glued to the spot.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I started to feel sick. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. It reminded me of panic attacks I used to have. I wanted to run, to call for help, to do something, but I just stood there, watching.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel distressed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Eventually, they handcuffed him and dragged him to their car. He was barely conscious. I remember thinking, 'This can't be happening. This isn't right.' But I didn't do anything. I just... let it happen.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... guilty. Ashamed. I should have done something, anything. But I was too scared. Just like when I was bullied, I froze up and did nothing.",

    "Client: After they left, I went home and broke down. I couldn't stop shaking. I didn't tell anyone, not even my partner. I felt like a coward. I still do.",
    "Therapist: You're being very courageous sharing this.",
    "Client: I keep replaying it in my mind. What if I had spoken up? What if I had recorded it on my phone? Maybe I could have helped that man. Instead, I just stood there like a useless bystander.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep exploring them.",
    "Client: It's hard not to draw parallels to my experiences with bullying. In both situations, I felt completely powerless. But this time, I wasn't the victim. I was just... complicit in my silence.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. Well done.",
    "Client: I've been having nightmares about it. Sometimes I'm the one being beaten, sometimes I'm one of the officers. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling disgusted with myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel distressed. You're processing trauma.",
    "Client: I guess... I'm angry too. Angry at the police for their brutality, angry at myself for not doing anything, angry at the world for allowing this to happen. It's all just so messed up.",
    "Therapist: Your anger is understandable. Keep expressing yourself.",
    "Client: I don't know how to move forward from this. How do I forgive myself? How do I make sure I never freeze up like that again if I encounter a similar situation?",
    "Therapist: These are important questions. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: I just... I want to be better. I want to be the kind of person who stands up against injustice, not someone who cowers in fear. But I don't know if I have it in me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength by confronting this. Well done.",
