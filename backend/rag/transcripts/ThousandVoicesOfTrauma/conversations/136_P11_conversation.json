    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going back to that moment when I was bullied because of my Polynesian heritage... it's bringing up so many emotions. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's strange to say that out loud.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The vivid details, I guess. I could practically smell the school cafeteria again. And the laughter... God, their laughter was so cruel. I remembered how small I felt, how I wanted to disappear. But this time, as I was reliving it, I also felt this... anger. Like, how dare they make me feel ashamed of who I am?",
    "Therapist: That anger is significant. Tell me more.",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's new, I think. Before, I always just felt shame and hurt. But now, I'm starting to realize that I didn't deserve that treatment. No one does. It's like... I'm seeing it through adult eyes for the first time, you know? And I'm angry at those kids, but also at the teachers who never stepped in, at the system that allowed it to happen.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift feel?",
    "Client: It's empowering, in a way. But also scary. I've carried this pain for so long, it's almost become a part of me. Letting go of it... it's like I'm losing a piece of myself. But maybe that's okay? I don't know. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: Confusion is normal. What else?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how this has affected my life. My depression, my struggle to form relationships... it all traces back to feeling like I didn't belong. And now, as a student again at 43, those old fears of not fitting in sometimes creep up. But reliving that memory... it's like I'm finally seeing the root of it all.",
    "Therapist: How might this awareness help you?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it can help me be kinder to myself? Like, understanding where these feelings come from might help me challenge them. And maybe... maybe I can start to see my heritage as something beautiful, not something to be ashamed of. It's just... it's a lot to unpack, you know?",
    "Therapist: It is. How are you managing?",
    "Client: Honestly? It's tough. Some days I feel strong, like I'm making progress. Other days, the old pain hits me like a wave and I feel like I'm drowning. But... I'm here, right? I'm trying. That has to count for something.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. Next steps?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep exploring this. Maybe find ways to connect with my culture that feel safe and empowering. And I want to work on not letting those old bullies' voices dictate how I see myself now. It's going to be hard, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I never thought I'd be able to face these memories, but here I am. It's painful, but... I think it's necessary. I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope, you know? Like maybe I can heal from this, maybe I can be proud of who I am. It's scary, but... it's also kind of exciting."
