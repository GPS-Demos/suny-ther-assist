    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's been years since the accident, but talking about it still feels so raw.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this at your own pace. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. (deep breath) Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes and taking us to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (closes eyes, breathing quickens) I... I'm at the airport. It's busy, noisy. I can smell coffee from the nearby caf\u00e9. My son, Raj, he's... he's checking in for his flight. He looks so excited about his business trip to New York.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're saying goodbye at the security checkpoint. Raj hugs me tightly. He says, \"I'll call you when I land, Mum.\" His smile is so bright. I watch him walk away, waving one last time before he disappears into the crowd.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Proud. Happy for him. But there's also this... this knot in my stomach. I didn't know why then, but now... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My hands are getting clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. What happens after Raj goes through security?",
    "Client: I go home. Everything seems normal. I start preparing dinner for my husband. The news is on in the background. Suddenly, there's a breaking news alert. A plane has... has gone missing over the Atlantic. (breathing becomes rapid)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. What do you see in the room around you?",
    "Client: (opens eyes briefly) I see... I see the plant in the corner. Your desk. The clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, close your eyes again and continue.",
    "Client: (closes eyes) Okay. I... I remember dropping the plate I was holding. It shatters on the floor, but I barely notice. I'm glued to the TV, praying it's not Raj's flight. But deep down, I know. I just know.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: The phone rings. It's my husband. He's heard the news too. His voice is shaking. He says he's coming home right away. I can't speak. I just... I just slide down to the floor, clutching the phone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Disbelief. It's like the world is ending. I keep thinking, 'This can't be happening. Not to Raj. Not to us.'",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now, in this room?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest hurts. But... I'm here. I'm safe. It's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. What happens after the phone call?",
    "Client: The next few hours are a blur. Family starts arriving. The house fills with people, but I feel so alone. We're all waiting for news, any news. The TV keeps showing the same footage of the ocean. No signs of the plane.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like I'm made of lead. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still high. About an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Days pass. There's no good news. Just... just confirmation that the plane went down. No survivors. I remember the moment they officially declared Raj... (voice breaks) dead. It felt like my heart was being ripped out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. Where do you feel it in your body?",
    "Client: In my chest. It's like a physical pain. And in my throat, like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (nods) The funeral was... was surreal. So many people came. They all had stories about Raj, how kind he was, how brilliant. But all I could think was, 'He should be here. This isn't right.'",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind during the funeral?",
    "Client: Anger. Sadness. I keep thinking, 'Why him? Why my son?' It's not fair. He had his whole life ahead of him.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal thoughts. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens after the funeral?",
    "Client: Life... life goes on, somehow. But everything feels empty. Raj's room stays untouched. I can't bear to change anything. Sometimes, I sit in there for hours, just... just holding his things, trying to feel close to him.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those moments?",
    "Client: It's hard. Sometimes I talk to him, like he's still here. Other times, I just cry. My husband, he tries to help, but he's hurting too. We're both just... lost.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But... also a little relieved? It's like... like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) You know, I've never talked about that day in so much detail before. It's always been too painful.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something I've been running from for years.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you've done. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll end here for today. Remember to be gentle with yourself. You've done important work.",
    "Client: (nods) I will. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue to work through this together. Take care, Mrs. Patel."
