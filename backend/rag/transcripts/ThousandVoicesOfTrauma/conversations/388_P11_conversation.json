    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Reliving that moment when I found out about my brother's death... it's like I'm right back there again. The shock, the disbelief... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The silence. It's funny, you'd think it would be the words, you know? But it was the silence after my mum told me. It was like the world just... stopped. And then this rushing sound in my ears. I remember thinking, \"This can't be real. This isn't happening.\"",
    "Therapist: How did your body feel during that memory?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders were up around my ears, and I could feel my heart racing. It's like my body knew something was wrong before my mind could process it. And now, even talking about it, I can feel that tension creeping back in.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What thoughts came up?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"I should've been there. I should've done something.\" It's irrational, I know. There's nothing I could've done to prevent the accident. But that guilt... it's still there, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop now. Like, I'm constantly on edge, expecting bad news. It's affecting my studies, my relationships. I find it hard to get close to people because... what if I lose them too?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How else has it impacted you?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having these nightmares. Not about my brother's accident specifically, but just... losing people. Sometimes it's my parents, sometimes it's friends. And I wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these nightmares?",
    "Client: Um, not very well, to be honest. I've been avoiding sleep, staying up late studying or just... I don't know, watching mindless TV. Anything to avoid closing my eyes and facing those dreams.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned from this process so far?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to realize that avoiding these feelings isn't helping. It's just prolonging the pain. And maybe, just maybe, facing them head-on like this... it's hard, but it might be the only way through.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... kind of freeing? Like, for the first time since it happened, I feel like there might be a way forward. I'm not sure what that looks like yet, but just knowing it exists... it gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try talking about my brother more. Not just the accident, but the good times too. I've been avoiding even saying his name, and that's not fair to his memory. Maybe I could start by sharing some stories with my roommates?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How can you support yourself in this?",
    "Client: I could... maybe set up a small memorial in my room? Nothing big, just a photo and maybe some of his favorite things. And I could journal about our memories. That way, even if I'm not ready to share with others, I'm still acknowledging him.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful idea. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I feel lighter somehow. Like I've been carrying this heavy backpack and I've finally taken it off for a moment. I know I have to put it back on, but now I know I can take breaks from it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I mean, I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be okay someday. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but... someday. And that's something to hold onto.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What will you focus on until next time?",
    "Client: I think I'll try setting up that small memorial we talked about. And maybe... maybe I'll try looking at some old photos. Not for long, just a few minutes each day. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How do you feel about ending our session?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like after a hard workout. I'm looking forward to going home and just... being. Not trying to run from my thoughts for once.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy approach. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really, thank you for helping me through this. I'll see you next week."
