    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of the airplane crash felt so vivid this time. I could almost smell the fuel and hear the screams. It's like I was right back there, you know? My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. There was nothing I could do to stop what was happening. It reminded me of... of the abuse. That same feeling of being trapped, unable to escape. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was harder than I expected. I thought I'd be more prepared, but it hit me like a ton of bricks. I felt scared, angry, and... ashamed? I don't know why I feel ashamed about something that wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What do you think triggered that shame?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe because I survived when others didn't? Or because I froze up during the crash, just like I did during the abuse. I feel like I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I notice I'm always on edge, especially in confined spaces or crowds. And the nightmares... they're often a mix of the crash and the abuse. It's like my brain can't separate them anymore.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. How do you think this relates to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I want to feel safe again, to not be constantly looking over my shoulder. And I want to be able to fly without panicking. But it feels so far away right now.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What's one small step you could take towards those goals?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try sitting in a parked car for a few minutes? It's enclosed, but I can leave if I need to. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: Scary, but... also a little empowering? Like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else have you learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see how the crash and the abuse are connected in my mind. And maybe that by working through one, I'm actually addressing both? It's complicated, but it feels like I'm starting to untangle things a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How can you build on this?",
    "Client: I could... maybe start journaling about the connections I'm seeing? And try to challenge some of the shame I'm feeling. It's not easy, but I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrified. But also... determined? I can see how it's helping, even if it's really hard. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe some more grounding techniques? Sometimes I feel lost in the memories. And... is it okay if we take things a bit slower next time? Today was a lot.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll go at your pace. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again."
