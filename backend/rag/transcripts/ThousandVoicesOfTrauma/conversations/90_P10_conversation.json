    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doc. Been thinkin' 'bout it all week. Part of me wants to get it over with, but another part... well, it's scared, you know? My hands are a bit shaky just thinkin' about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Hmm... I'd say about a 60. My heart's beatin' faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Take us back to that night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: (Exhales slowly) It's... it's late. Must be 'round midnight. I'm in my bed, dozin' off while the TV's still on. Then... then I hear it. A crash from downstairs. At first, I think maybe I dreamed it, but... no, there it is again. Footsteps. Heavy ones.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart... it's poundin' so hard. I'm frozen, can't move. Thinkin' maybe if I stay real still, they'll just take what they want and leave.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The steps are comin' up the stairs now. Slow, like they're tryin' to be quiet, but the old wood's creakin'. I... I can hear my own breath, it's so loud in my ears. I'm prayin' they don't come in here, but... oh God, the doorknob's turnin'.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: A... a shadow. Tall, bulky. Can't make out a face in the dark. He's... he's got somethin' in his hand. Looks like a crowbar or somethin'. I'm... I'm tryin' to pretend I'm asleep, but I can feel my whole body shakin'.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's... it's up to 80, doc. This is tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Continue when ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... The guy, he's movin' towards my dresser. I can hear him riflin' through my stuff. My watch, my wallet... they're all in there. I'm... I'm so angry, but I'm more scared. What if he sees I'm awake?",
    "Therapist: Focus on those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinkin' about Martha, my late wife. How she always said we should get a security system. Wishin' I'd listened. Feelin' stupid, vulnerable. Like I can't protect myself or my home anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How's your body feeling?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My jaw's clenched tight, and my fists are balled up under the covers. I want to do somethin', but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he's turnin' towards the bed now. I can smell him - sweat and somethin' else, maybe alcohol. My eyes are barely open, but I can see him leanin' over me. I'm... I'm holdin' my breath, prayin' he thinks I'm asleep.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's... it's at 90 now, doc. This is... it's almost too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Deep, shaky breath) Okay... okay. The guy, he's... he's reachin' out. I can feel his hand near my face. I'm... I'm about to lose it, about to scream or fight or... I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I can't take it anymore. I sit up suddenly, yellin' at the top of my lungs. The guy, he jumps back, startled. I'm... I'm reachin' for the lamp, my hand shakin' so bad I can barely grab it.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Terror... but also this... this surge of adrenaline. Like my body's finally catchin' up to the danger. I'm yellin', \"Get out! Get out of my house!\" My voice sounds strange, like it's not even mine.",
    "Therapist: How does the intruder react?",
    "Client: He's... he's backin' away. I can see his eyes now, wide with surprise. He didn't expect me to wake up, to fight back. He's... he's turnin', runnin' out the door. I can hear him stumbling down the stairs.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm out of bed now, my legs barely holdin' me up. I'm followin' him, still yellin'. Part of me knows it's stupid, that he could turn and hurt me, but I can't stop. I'm at the top of the stairs, watchin' him run out the front door.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaky... so shaky. My heart's racin', and I feel... I feel sick to my stomach. But also... also kinda proud? Like I did somethin', you know? I didn't just lay there and take it.",
    "Therapist: That's a mix of emotions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. Still high, but... but I'm startin' to calm down a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take us through what happens after the intruder leaves.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standin' there at the top of the stairs for a long time. Can't move. Finally, I make my way down, checkin' every room, every closet. My hands are shakin' so bad I can barely dial 911.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you wait for the police?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. At the guy, at myself for not havin' better security. I'm thinkin' about Martha again, how she'd be fussin' over me if she were here. I'm... I'm feelin' so alone, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Like I've run a marathon. My throat's sore from yellin', and I've got this... this hollow feeling in my chest. Like somethin's been taken from me, and it ain't just my wallet.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens when the police arrive?",
    "Client: They're... they're askin' questions, takin' notes. I'm tryin' to remember details, but it's all a blur. They're tellin' me I did the right thing, that I'm lucky. But I don't feel lucky. I feel... I feel violated.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How do you cope in the following days?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sleepin' much. Every little noise has me jumpin'. I'm checkin' the locks over and over. Can't seem to settle. I'm... I'm drinkin' more than usual, tryin' to calm my nerves. It ain't helpin' much, but... but it's somethin'.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Let's pause here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (Long exhale) It's... it's tough, doc. Bringin' it all back like that. But... but I feel a bit lighter, you know? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 50 now. Still worked up, but... but better than when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end."
