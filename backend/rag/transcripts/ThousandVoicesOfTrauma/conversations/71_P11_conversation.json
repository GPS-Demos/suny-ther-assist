    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is still on high alert, you know? Going through that memory of the bullying incident... it brought back so many intense emotions. I could almost feel the fear and helplessness washing over me again, just like it did back then. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when you really focus on it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The faces. God, their faces. I could see every detail - the sneers, the cold eyes. It's like they were right in front of me again. And the feeling of being cornered, trapped. I felt so small and powerless. It's funny, I'm a grown woman now, successful in my own right, but in that moment, I was that scared little girl all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your day-to-day experiences now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I still sometimes feel that way when I'm in crowded places or if someone raises their voice near me. It's like a flash of that old fear. But it's not as intense or long-lasting as it was during the exposure. In my daily life, I've learned to push past it most of the time, but it's always there, lurking in the background.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" And then I felt angry at myself for still being affected by it after all these years. But there was also this new thought - a realization that I survived. I got through it. I'm here now, and those bullies... they don't have power over me anymore. At least, that's what I'm trying to tell myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, I guess. But also a bit scary. Like, if I let go of this fear and anger, what's left? It's been a part of me for so long. But at the same time, I'm tired of carrying it around. I want to be free of it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What do you think could help you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to keep reminding myself that I'm not that helpless kid anymore. I have resources now, support. And maybe I need to be kinder to myself, stop blaming myself for what happened. It's just... it's hard to break that habit of self-blame.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How might you practice that self-kindness?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe I could start by acknowledging my feelings without judgment? Like, when I feel scared or anxious, instead of getting frustrated with myself, I could just say, \"Okay, I'm feeling this way, and that's alright.\" And maybe remind myself of how far I've come, the things I've accomplished despite carrying this burden.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, definitely. But I also feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can finally start to put this behind me. It's tough, reliving these memories, but if it helps me reclaim my life, then I'm willing to keep going. I just hope it gets easier.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need reassurance that what I'm feeling is normal. And maybe some strategies for coping with the intense emotions that come up during and after the exposures. And... I know this might sound silly, but just knowing that you're here, listening and understanding... that helps a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's not silly at all. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I'm curious about how this relates to the session topic of human trafficking. I mean, my experience with bullying was awful, but it seems so much less severe compared to what trafficking victims go through. I almost feel guilty for struggling so much with my experiences when others have been through far worse.",
    "Therapist: Your experiences are valid. How might we address that guilt?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe I need to remind myself that trauma isn't a competition. My experiences shaped me and affected me deeply, and that's okay. Maybe understanding my own trauma can help me be more empathetic towards others, including those who've experienced trafficking. It's all part of recognizing the impact of abuse and working towards healing, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard work and now I need to rest and process. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today. Is it okay if I take some time to just sit quietly before I leave?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
