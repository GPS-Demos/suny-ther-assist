    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the medical trauma you experienced as a refugee?",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It was about three years ago when we were in the refugee camp. I had been having this pain in my abdomen for weeks, but I tried to ignore it. One night, it got so bad I couldn't sleep. I was sweating and shaking. My wife wanted to take me to the camp's medical tent, but I was scared. I'd heard stories about people going in and never coming out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, the pain became unbearable, and I agreed to go. The medical tent was overcrowded, and the smell was awful. It was a mix of antiseptic, bodily fluids, and fear. We waited for hours, and I could hear people moaning and crying. I felt so helpless and exposed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: When it was finally my turn, the doctor barely looked at me. He quickly examined me and said I needed emergency surgery. I panicked. I didn't want to be cut open in this dirty, crowded place. But I had no choice. They prepped me for surgery right there, with only a thin curtain for privacy. I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The anesthesia didn't work properly. I could feel everything, but I couldn't move or speak. The pain was excruciating. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I could hear the doctors talking, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: After the surgery, they moved me to a recovery area. It was just a mat on the floor. I was in so much pain, and there weren't enough painkillers. I developed an infection, and my fever was so high. I was delirious for days. My wife had to fight to get me antibiotics. I felt so vulnerable and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the nightmares. Even after I recovered physically, I couldn't sleep without reliving the surgery. I'd wake up screaming, feeling the phantom pain of the scalpel. It affected my relationship with my wife and children. I became irritable and withdrawn. I couldn't bear to be touched or to visit any medical facility.",
    "Therapist: I hear how difficult this is. You're very brave.",
    "Client: It's been three years, but sometimes I still feel like I'm back there. The smell of antiseptic makes me nauseous. I avoid doctors at all costs. Even now, talking about it, my heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I know I'm safe here in Australia, but part of me is still trapped in that medical tent.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I feel so ashamed. I should be stronger than this. My family needs me, but I can't shake off this fear. Every time I have a pain or ache, I'm terrified it'll happen again. I feel like I've lost control over my own body and mind. How can I move past this?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel this way. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be haunted by this experience? I want to be the husband and father my family deserves, but this trauma is holding me back. I feel guilty for not being able to just \"get over it.\" It's like I'm still a refugee, but now I'm trapped in my own mind.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's continue working through this together."
