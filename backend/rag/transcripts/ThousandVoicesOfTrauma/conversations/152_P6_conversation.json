    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit anxious about today's session, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and recall the memory. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6 out of 10. I can feel my heart starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue with the memory. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see my daughter's Facebook page. All those horrible comments... people calling her names, saying she should... should kill herself. God, it's awful. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. What else?",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling so helpless. I didn't know how to protect her from this. She was so young, only 15. I should've done more...",
    "Therapist: It's been 5 minutes. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What happened next?",
    "Client: I confronted some of the kids' parents, but they didn't care. Said it was just \"kids being kids.\" But it wasn't! It was destroying my little girl. I... I can feel the anger rising in me now.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My jaw is clenched. I want to punch something. But I also feel... God, I feel so guilty. I should've done more to help her.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still an 8. Maybe even a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Stay with it. What happened after that?",
    "Client: I... I found her. In the bathroom. She'd taken all her pills. I called 911, but... but it was too late. My baby girl... she was gone. I can't... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. You're safe here. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay present. What do you see around you now?",
    "Client: I... I see your office. The green plant in the corner. My hands... they're shaking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep breathing. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. My heart's slowing down a bit. I... I made it through the memory.",
    "Therapist: You did. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but... also a bit relieved.",

    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
