    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit anxious, I guess. I know we've talked about doing this imaginal exposure thing, and I'm feeling pretty nervous about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that experience with the police, it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget it, you know? And now you're asking me to remember it in detail. I'm worried I might fall apart or... I don't know, lose control somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I help?",
    "Client: I guess I need to understand why this is necessary. I mean, I get that it's part of the treatment, but it feels counterintuitive to deliberately bring up these painful memories.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need to understand the rationale better to feel more comfortable with this.",
    "Therapist: It allows your brain to reprocess the memory safely.",
    "Client: Reprocess? What do you mean by that exactly?",
    "Therapist: It helps reduce the memory's emotional intensity over time.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like... desensitizing myself to the memory? But what if it makes things worse instead of better?",
    "Therapist: That's a common fear. How do you think it might worsen?",
    "Client: I'm worried that reliving it might trigger a severe depressive episode. Given my history with depression, I'm scared that diving into this trauma might push me over the edge. Or what if I have a panic attack during the session and can't calm down?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But how will you support me during this process? I mean, if I start to feel overwhelmed or if the memories become too intense?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you through grounding techniques if needed.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds helpful. Can you give me an example of what that might look like?",
    "Therapist: We could focus on your breath or surroundings.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I understand better now. It's still scary, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me. I guess my last question is... how long will this process take? Is it something we'll do in one session, or will it be ongoing?",
    "Therapist: It's typically multiple sessions. Ready to start today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, and I want to get better. If this is what it takes to move past this trauma and improve my PTSD symptoms, then I'm willing to try. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your support and guidance through this. It means a lot to have someone I trust helping me face these difficult memories."
