    "Therapist: Good afternoon, Mr. Abdel. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Samantha. There's a heaviness in my chest. I've been dreading this, to be honest. The memories... they're not easy to face.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Let's start with the day you were imprisoned. Close your eyes and describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm in my office. It's a warm day, the sun streaming through the windows. I can hear the bustle of Cairo outside. Suddenly, there's a commotion in the hallway. Loud voices, heavy footsteps...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door bursts open. Men in uniform, their faces stern. One of them says, \"Ahmed Abdel, you're under arrest.\" My heart... it's pounding so hard. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're grabbing my arms, roughly. I try to ask why, but they silence me. As they drag me out, I see my colleagues' shocked faces. The shame... it's overwhelming. We're moving through the building, down the stairs. The sunlight hits my face as we exit, but it feels cold now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking of my wife. My children. Will I ever see them again? The fear is paralyzing. They shove me into a van. It's dark, stuffy. I can hardly breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the ground. You're here, in this room, safe.",
    "Client: (Audible breath) Thank you. I... I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens in the van?",
    "Client: We're driving. I don't know where. Every bump, every turn makes my stomach churn. We stop. They pull me out. We're at a nondescript building. Gray, imposing. They push me inside. The corridors are long, windowless. The air is stale, heavy with fear and despair.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My legs are weak. My mouth is dry. There's a constant trembling in my hands. They lead me to a small room. Bare concrete walls. A single lightbulb swinging overhead. They... they strip me of my clothes, my dignity. I'm shivering, exposed.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 85, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You survived this. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) Yes... yes, I did survive.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They throw a rough uniform at me. It smells of sweat and fear. As I put it on, a guard sneers, \"Welcome to your new home, traitor.\" The word cuts deep. I'm not a traitor. I love my country. I was just doing my job as a journalist...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: They push me into a cell. It's tiny, maybe 6 by 8 feet. There's a thin mat on the floor, a bucket in the corner. The door slams shut. The sound echoes, final. I'm alone. The silence is deafening. I... I sink to the floor, my back against the cold wall. And then... then the tears come. Silent at first, then wracking sobs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I'm there again. My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on my voice. You're here, in this room. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Deep, shaky breaths) Thank you. I... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you can handle this. These are just memories. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The first night is the worst. The darkness is absolute. I can hear others crying, screaming. Sleep is impossible. I keep thinking of my family. Do they know where I am? Are they safe? The guilt is overwhelming. I should have been more careful with my reporting...",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could say to your family at that moment?",
    "Client: I... I want to tell them I'm sorry. That I love them. That I'll find a way back to them. But the words catch in my throat. All I can do is whisper their names into the darkness.",
    "Therapist: That's very powerful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. But I feel like I need to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens the next day?",
    "Client: The cell door opens. Harsh light floods in. A guard barks at me to get up. My body aches from the hard floor. They take me to an interrogation room. The questions start. Who are my sources? What do I know? I try to explain I'm just a journalist, but they don't listen. The interrogation goes on for hours. No food, no water. Just endless questions, threats, and... and...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Take your time.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) They... they start to hit me. Slaps at first, then punches. The pain is sharp, shocking. But worse is the helplessness. I can't defend myself. I can't make them understand.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 95. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Audible breathing) Okay... okay, I'm feeling a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I did survive.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: They throw me back in the cell. Everything hurts. My ribs, my face. I curl up on the mat, trying to find a position that doesn't cause pain. The hours blur together. I lose track of time. Days? Weeks? I don't know. The interrogations continue. Sometimes they withhold food, or keep the lights on constantly. Sleep becomes a luxury.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping during this time?",
    "Client: I... I start to retreat into my mind. I think of happier times. My wedding day. The birth of my children. I recite poetry in my head, articles I've written. Anything to escape the reality of my situation.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful coping mechanism. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. It's still high, but I feel like I can manage it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The worst part is the isolation. No news from outside. No contact with my family. The uncertainty is maddening. Are they looking for me? Have they forgotten me? The guards taunt me, telling me I've been abandoned. Some days, I almost believe them.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What keeps you going?",
    "Client: Hope. A fragile, flickering thing, but it's there. Hope that someday, somehow, I'll see my family again. That the truth will come out. That justice will prevail. It's all I have left to cling to.",
    "Therapist: That's very powerful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let out something that's been bottled up for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels after processing these memories. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... the painting on the wall. The plant in the corner. And your notepad.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, two things you hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. And the faint sound of traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. And one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: The softness of this chair cushion.",
    "Therapist: Very good. You've done incredibly well today, Mr. Abdel. How are you feeling now that we're back in the present?",
    "Client: I feel... tired. But also, somehow, a bit stronger. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown great courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I just want to thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together. For now, be gentle with yourself. You've done important work today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Samantha. I'll try to remember that.",
    "Therapist: That's all for today. We'll pick this up in our next session. Take care, Mr. Abdel.",
    "Client: Thank you. Goodbye."
