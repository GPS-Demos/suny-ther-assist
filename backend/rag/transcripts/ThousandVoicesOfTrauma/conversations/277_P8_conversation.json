    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of foggy. The memory of the earthquake, it's so vivid now. I can still feel the ground shaking beneath my feet, you know? My heart is pounding, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how powerless I felt when it happened. The earth just opened up, swallowing everything in its path. I remember screaming, but I couldn't even hear my own voice over the rumbling. God, I was so scared I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I have this urge to run, to get away, but I know it's just a memory. It's... it's exhausting, feeling like this.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why did this have to happen to me?\" It's not fair. I lost so much that day - my home, my sense of security. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel safe again. And then I feel guilty for thinking that way when others lost so much more. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. I mean, they're still strong, but before, it was like I was constantly reliving it. Every little shake or loud noise would send me into a panic. Now, it's more like... like I'm observing the memory from a distance. It still hurts, but I can breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it means I'm healing? Slowly, but still. It's weird because part of me is relieved, but another part feels... I don't know, almost guilty for not being as affected anymore. Like I'm betraying the memory of what happened or something.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's like... if I move on, if I let go of this fear and pain, I'm somehow forgetting about the tragedy. About the people who didn't make it. I know it doesn't make sense, but I can't shake this feeling that I owe it to them to remember, to keep hurting.",
    "Therapist: How does holding onto that pain serve you?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if it does. Maybe it's a way of honoring what happened? But when I really think about it, it's just keeping me stuck. It's not helping anyone, least of all me. I want to move forward, I do. I'm just... I'm scared of what that means.",
    "Therapist: What does moving forward look like to you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means accepting what happened. Not forgetting, but not letting it control my life either. Being able to think about the earthquake without feeling like I'm right back in it. Maybe even being able to help others who've been through similar experiences. I want to feel strong again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. Part of me doubts if I can ever get there. But another part... another part feels hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim my life. It's a small spark, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What's helping to fuel that spark of hope?",
    "Client: These sessions, for one. Being able to talk about it without completely falling apart. The fact that I can now sit through these imaginal exposures without having a full-blown panic attack. It's progress, right? Slow, but it's there. And... and the support of my friends. They've been so patient with me through all of this.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of empowering. I mean, I still have a long way to go, but looking back, I can see how far I've come. It makes me feel like maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Like maybe I can handle more than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What do you want to do with that feeling?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to push myself a little more. Maybe try to get back into the workforce, even if it's just part-time at first. The idea still scares me, but I feel like I might be ready to take that step. Is that... is that realistic?",
    "Therapist: What makes you feel it might be realistic?",
    "Client: Well, I've been managing my day-to-day life better lately. I'm sleeping more regularly, eating better. I've even started going for walks in the park near my apartment. It's not much, but it's more than I could do a few months ago. And honestly, I'm tired of feeling stuck. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: How might returning to work impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think it could be really good for me. Give me a sense of purpose, you know? A reason to get up in the morning. And maybe... maybe it would help me feel more normal again. Like I'm part of the world instead of just watching it go by. But I'm also worried about how I'll handle the stress.",
    "Therapist: What specific concerns do you have?",
    "Client: I'm worried about having a panic attack at work. Or freezing up if there's an emergency drill. And what if I can't concentrate because I'm too anxious? I don't want to let anyone down or lose a job because I can't handle it. But at the same time, I know I need to start somewhere.",
    "Therapist: How might you address those concerns?",
    "Client: I guess... I could start by looking for a job that's not too high-pressure. Maybe something part-time to ease back into it. And I could be upfront with my employer about my situation, see if they can make accommodations. I could also use some of the coping techniques we've talked about here, like deep breathing or grounding exercises.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about this plan?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic? It's scary, but also kind of exciting. Like I'm taking my life back, piece by piece. I know it won't be easy, but I think I'm ready to try. And knowing I have support - from you, from my friends - that makes it feel more doable.",
    "Therapist: What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll start by updating my resume this week. Maybe look at some job listings, just to see what's out there. And I'll practice my coping techniques every day, so I feel more prepared. Is that... is that a good place to start?",
    "Therapist: How does that plan sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels good. Manageable. Like I'm taking control without overwhelming myself. I'm nervous, but also... kind of proud? Like I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water. I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This session was... intense, but in a good way. I feel like I've made some real progress. Thank you for guiding me through this. I'm looking forward to our next session.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
