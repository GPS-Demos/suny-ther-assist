    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous about it. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it. Are you sure this is necessary?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. It's a challenging but crucial step. Why do you think it feels so daunting?",
    "Client: Well, every time I even get close to thinking about it, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. It's like I'm right back there, you know? And with everything else going on in my life - my studies, my relationship, trying to stay clean - I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How have you been coping with these feelings lately?",
    "Client: I've been trying to use some of the breathing techniques we've practiced, but sometimes I still find myself reaching for a drink. I know it's not healthy, but it numbs the fear for a while. My partner's been really supportive, but I can tell they're worried about me too.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's discuss how we'll approach this together.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? And how it's supposed to help? Because right now, it just sounds like torture.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the memory gradually, in a safe environment. It helps process the trauma. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what if I panic? Or what if I can't handle it and need to stop? And how long will this take? I'm worried about how it might affect my studies or my relationship if I'm a mess after these sessions.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are normal. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I guess knowing I have some control helps. But I'm still scared. What if talking about it makes the nightmares worse? Or what if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: It's brave to face these fears. Remember, you're not alone. How can I support you best during this process?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think... maybe just reminding me that I'm safe here, and that it's okay if I need to take breaks. And maybe we could have a plan for after the session? Something to help me ground myself before I have to face the rest of my day?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll create a post-session plan. Your courage is commendable. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still scared, but I want to get better. I want to be able to think about what happened without feeling like my world is ending. And I want to be able to be there for my partner without all this baggage. So, yes, I'm ready. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start with a breathing exercise. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
