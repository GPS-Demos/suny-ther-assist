    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Chen, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important for my recovery.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your SUDS rating now.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Please begin describing the animal attack.",
    "Client: It was a sunny afternoon. I was walking in the park near my house, the one with the small pond. I remember the sound of ducks quacking... Then suddenly, I heard growling behind me. I turned and saw this large dog, teeth bared, running straight at me. I froze, I couldn't move...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me, grabbing my arm in its jaws. The pain was excruciating, and I screamed. I could feel its teeth tearing into my skin. I tried to push it away, but it was so strong. I fell to the ground, and it kept attacking...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... an 8. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I thought I was going to die. The dog was on top of me, and I could smell its hot breath. I closed my eyes, waiting for it to go for my throat. But then I heard someone yelling, and the dog was pulled off me. When I opened my eyes, a man was holding the dog by its collar.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. I can feel my whole body shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I was lying there, bleeding and in shock. The man called an ambulance. I remember looking at my arm and seeing all the blood... I felt so helpless and vulnerable. Even after the paramedics arrived, I couldn't stop crying and shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it's not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. Continue.",
    "Client: At the hospital, they stitched up my wounds and gave me shots. But the worst part was the fear that stayed with me. For weeks after, I couldn't go near the park. I'd have nightmares about dogs attacking me. I felt so weak and ashamed that I couldn't defend myself.",

    "Client: It's still painful, but... I can talk about it without feeling like I'm right back there. It's more like watching a movie of what happened, instead of reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today, Mrs. Chen. How about we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session. Take care."
