    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. What exactly does imaginal exposure involve?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel nervous. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memories in a safe environment. What concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent so long trying not to think about what happened in the cult. The idea of purposely bringing those memories up is terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring, I guess. But still, why do we need to do this? Can't we just focus on moving forward instead of dwelling on the past?",
    "Therapist: Great question. Revisiting memories helps process them, reducing their power over you. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I suppose that makes sense... but it's still scary. I've worked so hard to build a new life away from all that. I'm worried this will set me back. How can you be sure this won't make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your progress is important. This process, while challenging, aims to further your healing. What would help you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain more about what exactly will happen during these sessions? And what should I expect to feel?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit memories gradually, and you may experience strong emotions. I'll guide you through coping strategies. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds intense, but I appreciate your guidance. I guess I'm willing to try if you really think it will help. Can we start slowly? And if it gets too overwhelming, can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start slowly and can pause anytime. Your bravery is commendable. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm okay for now. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. I just hope this really does help in the long run. It's been so hard trying to move past everything that happened in the cult. Sometimes I feel like I'll never truly be free from it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are understandable. This process can lead to significant improvements. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this."
