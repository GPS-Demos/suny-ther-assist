    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The earthquake, the chaos... it's all so vivid. My heart's racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange, even though I'm here in this room, part of me still feels like I'm in that hospital, surrounded by all that destruction.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... it's more like terror. I keep seeing flashes of the hospital walls crumbling, hearing the screams of patients and staff. I was supposed to be there to help people, you know? I've been a doctor for over 40 years, but in that moment, I felt so... helpless. It's like all my training, all my experience just vanished. I couldn't do anything to stop the building from falling apart around us.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight, a heavy stone sitting right in the pit of my stomach. My hands feel cold and clammy, and there's this trembling in my legs. I keep thinking about how I froze when the first tremors hit. I should have acted faster, should have done more to get people out. But I just stood there, watching as everything fell apart. What kind of doctor does that make me?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall this?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"I failed them.\" All those people who were counting on me. Patients who were already vulnerable, staff who looked to me for guidance. I was the senior physician on duty, and I couldn't protect them. It's like... like I've betrayed everything I've ever stood for as a doctor. And then there's this voice in my head asking, \"What if it happens again? What if I freeze up the next time someone needs me?\" It's... it's terrifying to think that I might not be able to trust myself in a crisis anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief, to be honest. I've never really talked about this before. Back home, after the earthquake, everyone was so focused on rebuilding, on moving forward. There wasn't really space to process what we'd been through. But saying it out loud... it's like I'm finally acknowledging how much this affected me. It's painful, yes, but also... I don't know, maybe a little freeing? Like I'm not carrying this burden all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: I... hmm. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as intense. My breathing feels a bit easier. I'm still shaky, but it's more like a tremor now, not the violent shaking I felt earlier. And my hands... they're warmer now. It's strange, I feel both exhausted and somehow lighter at the same time. Like I've run a marathon, but also put down a heavy load I've been carrying for too long.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to previous times you've recalled the event?",
    "Client: It's... different. Usually, when I think about the earthquake, it's like I'm right back there. The memories come in flashes, overwhelming me. I'd push them away as quickly as possible. But this time, even though it was intense, it feels... I don't know, more contained? Like I'm able to look at the memory without being completely swept away by it. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful and scary, but... maybe a little less so? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself from this exercise?",
    "Client: I... I think I've realized that I'm stronger than I gave myself credit for. Yes, I froze initially, but I also remember now that I did eventually act. I helped evacuate patients, treated injuries in the aftermath. I've been so focused on my perceived failure that I'd forgotten about the things I did manage to do. Maybe... maybe I'm not as helpless as I thought. It's a small realization, but it feels significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight affect your view of yourself moving forward?",
    "Client: That's... that's a good question. I suppose it could help me be a bit kinder to myself. I've been so hard on myself since the earthquake, constantly second-guessing my abilities as a doctor. But if I can acknowledge that I did do some good, even in such a terrible situation... maybe I can start to rebuild some of that confidence I lost. It doesn't erase what happened, but it feels like... like maybe there's a path forward, you know? A way to reconcile the doctor I was before the earthquake with who I am now.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to continue this healing process?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep talking about it. This session, as difficult as it's been, has shown me how much I've been bottling up. Maybe... maybe I could look into support groups for medical professionals who've been through similar experiences? And I think I need to be more open with my family and friends. They've noticed I've been different since I came back, but I've always brushed off their concerns. It might be time to let them in a bit more.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as we near the end of our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard but necessary work. There's still a lot to process, and I know this is just the beginning, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit hopeful? Like maybe I can find a way through this. It's scary, but also... maybe a little exciting? The idea that I might be able to move past this, to feel like myself again... it's something I wasn't sure was possible before today.",
    "Therapist: What will you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a walk in the park near my apartment. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe I'll call my sister. I've been avoiding her calls, but... I think I'm ready to talk to her now. Not about everything, not yet, but... it's a start. And I'll make sure to get a good night's sleep. These sessions always leave me feeling exhausted, but in a way that feels productive. Thank you for today. It wasn't easy, but I think... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm actually looking forward to it. See you next week."
