    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see those images, you know? The way they looked at me, like I wasn't even human. It's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't take a full breath. And my heart... it's pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. It's like my body is stuck in that moment, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Like, why was I the one who had to go through this? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know others have suffered too. But then I get angry, you know? Angry at the people who did this, angry at myself for not being able to stop it. It's this cycle of thoughts that just keeps spinning.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you managing these emotions right now?",
    "Client: I'm trying to breathe, like we practiced. In through the nose, out through the mouth. But it's hard. Part of me wants to just curl up and disappear. Another part wants to scream. I keep reminding myself that I'm here, in this room, that it's over. But then I wonder... is it ever really over?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid questions. What do you mean when you ask if it's ever really over?",
    "Client: I guess... I mean, even though I'm not in that situation anymore, it's like it's still happening in my head. Every time I close my eyes, or hear a certain sound, or smell something familiar... I'm right back there. And I wonder if I'll ever be free from it. Will I always be that girl who was trafficked? Will I ever just be... me again?",
    "Therapist: That's a profound reflection. How does it feel to voice that concern?",
    "Client: It's... oddly liberating, actually. Like, I've been carrying this weight around, this fear that I'll never be normal again. But saying it out loud... it makes it feel less overwhelming somehow. Maybe because now it's not just trapped in my head?",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you shared that. What else are you noticing as we talk?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my breathing is getting a bit easier. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as constricting. And I'm realizing that even though remembering is painful, I'm stronger now than I was then. I survived. I'm here, talking about it. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does recognizing that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels proud, like I've accomplished something huge just by being here. But there's also this sadness, you know? Like, I shouldn't have had to be strong in that way. No one should. And then I think about all the others who might still be in those situations, and I feel this mix of gratitude and guilt.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex emotions. Can you expand on that guilt?",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's like survivor's guilt, I guess. I made it out, but what about the others? What makes me so special that I get to be here, safe, when they might still be suffering? And then I feel guilty for feeling guilty because I know that's not productive. It's this endless loop of emotions that I can't seem to break out of.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that it's not my fault. That I didn't choose this, and I'm not responsible for what happened to others. Sometimes I write in my journal, or I call my sister. She doesn't know everything, but she knows enough to understand when I'm struggling. And... I come here. Talking about it, as hard as it is, it helps. It's like each time I say it out loud, it loses a little bit of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What else helps you feel grounded?",
    "Client: Hmm... Sometimes I go for long walks in the park near my house. There's something about being in nature that helps me feel connected to something bigger than my trauma. And I've been trying to get back into painting. It's hard to focus sometimes, but when I can lose myself in the colors and textures... it's like a brief escape, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive coping strategies. How do they compare to the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: The exposure is... it's different. It's more intense, more immediate. With painting or walking, I can kind of... step away from the memories if I need to. But with the exposure, I'm right there in it. It's scarier, but also... I don't know, maybe more effective? Like I'm facing it head-on instead of skirting around the edges.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How do you feel now compared to before the exercise?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I'm exhausted, but there's also this tiny spark of... hope, maybe? Like maybe I can get through this. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. What do you want to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that I can face these memories and survive. That they're painful, but they don't have the power to destroy me. And maybe... maybe that each time I face them, I get a little bit stronger. Is that... is that realistic?",
    "Therapist: It's a very realistic and healthy perspective. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to do a quick grounding exercise if that's okay? Just to help me transition back into the rest of my day. And maybe... could we talk next time about how I can use some of what we did today when I'm on my own and the memories come up?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that grounding exercise now."
