    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge. I've been thinking about what we might talk about, and it's making my stomach feel all twisted up.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 40? I'm not panicking, but I'm definitely not relaxed.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, narrate in present tense and include sensory details.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm... I'm at home. It's evening, and I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. The lights are dim, and there's a heaviness in the air. I'm sitting on the couch, trying to focus on my phone, but my hands are shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The arguing is getting louder. I can hear my dad's voice rising, and there's a sharp sound \u2013 I think he slammed his hand on the counter. My mom's voice is shrill, defensive. I'm curling up tighter on the couch, willing myself to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I... I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a crash. I jump, my phone clattering to the floor. I hear my mom cry out. Before I know it, I'm on my feet, moving towards the kitchen. I'm terrified, but I can't just sit there.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you approach the kitchen?",
    "Client: I... *voice trembles* I see my dad. He's towering over my mom. There's a broken plate on the floor. My mom is backed against the counter, her arms raised defensively. Dad's face is red, contorted with anger. I've never seen him like this before.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment if you need to. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm standing in the doorway. My dad sees me and his expression changes. He looks... surprised? Ashamed? But it doesn't stop him. He turns back to Mom and grabs her arm. She cries out in pain. I want to do something, say something, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking this can't be happening. This isn't my dad. I should do something, but I'm so scared. What if he turns on me? What if I make it worse?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I find my voice. It comes out as a whisper at first, then louder. \"Dad, stop. Please stop.\" He turns to look at me, and for a second, I see confusion in his eyes. But then his face hardens again. He lets go of Mom's arm and takes a step towards me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body respond?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. There's a roaring in my ears, and I feel dizzy. But I stand my ground. I don't know where I find the strength, but I do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're showing a lot of courage. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Dad's coming closer. His fists are clenched at his sides. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. Mom's crying behind him. I want to run to her, but I can't move. Dad's saying something, but I can barely hear him over the pounding of my heart.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start talking. I'm not even sure what I'm saying. Pleading with him to calm down, to think about what he's doing. My voice is shaking, but I keep going. I'm terrified he's going to hit me, but I can't stop talking.",
    "Therapist: How does your father respond?",
    "Client: He... he stops. Just for a moment. I see something flicker in his eyes. Confusion? Shame? Then he... he turns away. Grabs his keys from the counter and storms out. The door slams behind him, and suddenly it's quiet. Too quiet.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after he leaves?",
    "Client: I'm frozen for a second, then I rush to Mom. She's slumped against the counter, crying softly. I wrap my arms around her, and we just stand there, holding each other. I can feel her shaking, or maybe it's me. I'm relieved Dad's gone, but I'm scared he'll come back.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a mess of emotions. Relief, fear, anger, sadness. My body feels drained, like I've run a marathon. But there's also this... I don't know, determination? Like I need to be strong for Mom.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 75 now. Still high, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I help Mom to the living room. We sit on the couch, and I get her some water. My hands are shaking as I hand her the glass. We don't talk much. What is there to say? I keep glancing at the door, worried Dad will come back.",
    "Therapist: How do you comfort your mother?",
    "Client: I... I hold her hand. I tell her it's going to be okay, even though I don't believe it myself. I offer to call someone \u2013 her sister, maybe? But she shakes her head. She doesn't want anyone to know. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... how did we get here? How long has this been happening when I'm not around? I'm angry at Dad, but also at myself for not noticing sooner. I'm scared about what will happen when he comes back. Will he apologize? Will he act like nothing happened? Will it happen again?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid concerns. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. My muscles ache from being tense for so long. My head is pounding. But I can't relax. I feel like I need to stay alert, to protect Mom if Dad comes back.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's around 65. I'm calmer, but still on edge.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue. What happens as the night progresses?",
    "Client: We stay on the couch. Mom eventually falls asleep, but I can't. I keep watching the door, jumping at every little sound. The hours drag by. I'm exhausted, but too wired to sleep. I keep replaying the scene in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. I scroll through my phone, but I'm not really seeing anything. I make lists in my head \u2013 things I need to do, places I want to go. Anything to avoid thinking about what happened. But it doesn't really work. The images keep intruding.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. What happens in the morning?",
    "Client: The sun starts to come up. Mom wakes up, looking disoriented. For a second, I hope it was all a bad dream. But then I see the bruise on her arm, and reality comes crashing back. We don't talk about it. Mom gets up, starts making coffee like it's a normal day. I feel... I don't know, angry? Frustrated? That we're just going to pretend it didn't happen.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I don't, really. I push them down. I help Mom make breakfast, we talk about mundane things. But there's this tension in the air. We're both watching the door, waiting for Dad to come home. I want to say something, to make a plan, but I don't know how to start that conversation.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50. I'm calmer, but there's still this undercurrent of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well describing this difficult experience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Talking about it brings up all these emotions. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I survived it once, I can face it again here.",
    "Therapist: That's a really insightful observation. You've shown a lot of courage today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the exposure.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay. I think I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Amira. We'll process this more in our next session. For now, what's something kind you can do for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll take a long bath. Try to relax a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed. I'm proud of the work you did today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll end our session here. Take care, Amira."
