    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? In that bank, with those men waving guns around. I can almost smell the fear in the air.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Helplessness, I think. It's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how powerless I felt, watching those poor bank tellers being threatened. I wanted to do something, anything, but I was frozen.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaky, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. It's like my body is still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep wondering if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had been braver, I could have helped somehow. But then I remind myself that it wasn't my fault. I... I just feel so guilty for surviving when others were hurt.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: They're not as intense now, I suppose. Back then, I couldn't even talk about it without breaking down completely. Now, it's... it's still painful, but I can at least put it into words. It's like the memory is losing some of its sharp edges.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. What do you think has contributed to that?",
    "Client: I guess... talking about it here, in therapy. And the breathing exercises you taught me have been helpful. Sometimes when the memories come, I can ground myself better now. It doesn't always work, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels proud that I'm facing this head-on. But another part of me is frustrated that I'm not \"over it\" yet. I know healing takes time, but sometimes I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: What does \"normal\" mean to you in this context?",
    "Client: I suppose... not jumping at every loud noise. Being able to go to the bank without my heart racing. Sleeping through the night without nightmares. Just... living without this constant undercurrent of fear and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your view of the world?",
    "Client: It's made me realize how fragile everything is. How quickly life can change. I used to feel safe most of the time, but now I'm always on edge, always expecting the worst. But... I'm also more appreciative of the good moments when they come.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about those good moments?",
    "Client: Well, like when I'm with my grandchildren. Their laughter... it's healing, somehow. Or when my husband and I have a quiet evening together. Those moments remind me that there's still beauty in the world, even after everything that's happened.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this trauma has affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's been hard on my family. I know they worry about me. Sometimes I push them away because I don't want to burden them with my fears. But they've been so patient and supportive. I'm trying to open up more, to let them in.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful in managing your symptoms?",
    "Client: The grounding techniques you taught me have been a lifesaver. And writing in my journal helps me process things. I've also started volunteering at a community garden. Being around plants, nurturing something... it's soothing. It gives me a sense of purpose.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with exposure exercises?",
    "Client: Honestly? They're terrifying. But I can see how they're helping. Each time, it gets a little easier to face the memories. It's like... like I'm slowly taking back control. So yes, I want to continue. I want to heal.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope for the future?",
    "Client: The progress I've made, I suppose. A few months ago, I couldn't even imagine talking about this without falling apart. Now, even though it's still painful, I can see a path forward. And my family... their love and support remind me that I'm not alone in this journey.",
    "Therapist: As we wrap up, how are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something difficult but important. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm good for now. Just... thank you. For listening, for helping me face this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get there.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of the work you're doing. We'll continue this journey together, one step at a time."
