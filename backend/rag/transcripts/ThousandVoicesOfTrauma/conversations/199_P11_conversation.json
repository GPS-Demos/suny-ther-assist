    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I found out about my wife's passing... it's still so raw, even after all this time. The grief just washed over me again, like a tidal wave. I could almost feel the weight of the phone in my hand, hear the tremor in my daughter's voice as she told me... It's hard, you know?",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of loss, I suppose. It's not just about losing Margaret, but... it's like I lost a part of myself too. We were together for over 50 years, and suddenly she was gone. I remember thinking, \"How am I supposed to go on without her?\" And then there's this... this guilt. I know it's irrational, but I can't help wondering if I could've done something differently, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still there, but maybe not as intense? I don't know. It's all mixed up with the sadness and the anger. I'm angry at the world, at God, at myself... And then I feel guilty for being angry. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How's your body feeling?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are all knotted up, and there's this heaviness in my chest. It's like I'm carrying around this invisible weight all the time. And sometimes, when I think about Margaret or when something reminds me of her, it gets hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I... I've been avoiding a lot of things. Places we used to go together, activities we enjoyed. Even simple things like watching TV can be a minefield of memories. And I've been pushing away my family too. They mean well, but sometimes their concern just reminds me of what I've lost.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I suppose... I'm realizing that avoiding these memories isn't really helping. It's like I've been trying to run from my own shadow. And maybe... maybe it's okay to feel this pain. It hurts like hell, but it's also a testament to how much Margaret meant to me, how much our life together mattered.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, no doubt about it. But I think... I think I need to keep going. For Margaret, for my family, for myself. I want to be able to remember her without feeling like I'm drowning in grief. And maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to honor her memory by living the life she'd want for me.",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous. What's one small step you can take?",
    "Client: I've been thinking... There's this park Margaret and I used to walk in every Sunday. I haven't been there since... well, you know. Maybe I could try going there this weekend. Just for a short walk. It'll be hard, but... I think she'd like that.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. How can you support yourself through that?",
    "Client: I... I could ask my daughter to come with me, maybe. And I'll bring a photo of Margaret. Oh, and I should probably bring some tissues too. I'm sure I'll need them. But you know what? I think I'm ready to face this. It's time."
