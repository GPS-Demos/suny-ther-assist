    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, Dr. Patel. There's a knot in my stomach. I know we've been working towards this, but now that we're here, I'm having second thoughts.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see our street. It's early morning, and there's an eerie stillness. The air feels heavy, like it's pressing down on me. I can hear distant rumbling... oh God, it's starting again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The ground is shaking. It's getting stronger. I can hear people shouting, glass breaking. My children are crying, clinging to me. I'm trying to stay calm for them, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The shaking is getting worse. Pictures are falling off the walls. I'm trying to get my children under the table, but it's so hard to move. The noise is deafening. I can hear buildings collapsing nearby.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My legs are shaking. I feel dizzy, like I might faint. There's this overwhelming urge to run, but I can't leave my children. I'm... I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Keep going.",
    "Client: The roof... oh no, part of the roof is caving in! Dust and debris are everywhere. I can barely breathe. I'm holding my children so tight, trying to shield them. I can hear my neighbor screaming for help, but I can't move. I can't help her. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Amira. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The shaking finally stops, but the aftermath... it's devastating. As we stumble out of the house, I see our neighborhood in ruins. People are crying, injured. There's so much destruction. I... I can't believe we survived.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm grateful we're alive, but I feel guilty. Why did we survive when others didn't? I should have helped my neighbor. I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts after trauma. Keep going.",
    "Client: We make our way to the evacuation center. It's chaos. So many people need help. I'm trying to stay strong for my children, but I'm falling apart inside. I keep thinking about our home, our lives... everything we've lost.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My distress is around 75. It's... it's getting a bit easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: At the center, I see families torn apart, people injured. The smell of fear and desperation is overwhelming. I'm trying to comfort my children, but I feel so helpless. How will we rebuild? What if it happens again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I see people coming together. Strangers helping each other. It gives me a glimmer of hope. But then I remember my husband... he was away on business. I don't know if he's alive. The uncertainty is killing me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. What happens next?",
    "Client: Days pass in a blur. We're living in a tent city now. The aftershocks keep coming, each one bringing back the terror. I'm exhausted, barely sleeping. Every loud noise makes me jump. I'm trying to be strong for my kids, but I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I'm not. I feel like I'm drowning. The relief workers are kind, but they can't fix this. I keep having nightmares, reliving the quake. And then... then we get the news about my husband.",
    "Therapist: Take your time, Amira. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. This part is so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* They... they found his body in the rubble of his hotel. I... I can't believe he's gone. How do I tell the children? How do we go on without him? I feel so alone, so scared.",
    "Therapist: I know this is painful. You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The grief is overwhelming. I have to be both mother and father now. We're homeless, my husband is gone, and I have no idea how to rebuild our lives. The children are traumatized, having nightmares. I feel like I'm failing them.",
    "Therapist: What do you do to cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. Helping others in the camp gives me purpose. But at night, when it's quiet, the fear and grief consume me. I feel guilty for surviving, for not being able to protect my family better.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Amira?",
    "Client: My distress is around 80. It's... it's still intense, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Months pass. We're still in temporary housing. The rebuilding is slow. Every tremor, every loud noise sends me into a panic. I'm struggling to sleep, always on edge. The children are having trouble in school. I feel like I'm failing them.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind during this time?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why us? Why did this happen?\" I'm angry at the world, at God. I feel so powerless. And I miss my husband so much. How can I be strong enough for all of us?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural thoughts after such a traumatic experience. Continue.",
    "Client: We finally move into a new home, but it doesn't feel safe. I'm constantly worried about another earthquake. I check and recheck our emergency supplies. I can't relax. The children are struggling too. They're clingy, afraid to let me out of their sight.",
    "Therapist: How are you managing these fears?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I am. I try to put on a brave face for the kids, but inside, I'm a mess. I feel like I'm always waiting for the next disaster. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's about 70. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well, Amira. Keep going.",
    "Client: As time passes, things slowly get better. We start to establish new routines. The children seem more settled. But the fear never really goes away. I still have nightmares, still jump at loud noises. And the grief... it comes in waves.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those moments?",
    "Client: Sometimes I let myself cry. Other times, I try to focus on the positive - we survived, we're together. But it's a constant struggle. I miss our old life, our sense of security. I miss my husband.",
    "Therapist: You've been through so much. How do you see yourself now?",
    "Client: I... I see myself as a survivor, I guess. Stronger than I ever thought I could be. But also more fragile. I know now how quickly everything can change. It's a hard balance - trying to move forward while still honoring what we've lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My distress is down to about 60. It's... it's still there, but talking about it like this... it helps. It makes it feel more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Amira. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but also relieved. It's hard to revisit those memories, but I think it's helping. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. We'll end here for today. Well done."
