    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there, in that dark room. It's cold and damp. I can smell mold and sweat. There are other people around me, but I can't see their faces clearly. We're all huddled together, waiting. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I hear footsteps approaching. Heavy boots on concrete. The door creaks open, and a bright light floods in. I squint, trying to make out the figures. There are two men, big guys. One of them points at me and says something in a language I don't understand. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: They grab my arm, roughly pulling me up. I try to resist, but I'm weak from lack of food. They drag me out of the room. The hallway is brighter, and I can see other doors, probably more rooms like the one I was in. I'm panicking, thinking about what they might do to me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: They take me to another room. It's cleaner, with a table and chairs. There's a woman there, well-dressed. She looks at me like I'm... like I'm not even human. She starts speaking to the men, gesturing at me. I realize they're... they're negotiating a price. For me. I feel sick, disgusted, terrified.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I want to run, to fight, to do something, but I'm frozen. The woman nods, and one of the men grabs me again. They're taking me somewhere else. I don't know where, but I know it's bad. I'm crying, begging them to let me go, but they ignore me like I'm not even there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: We go outside. It's night, and the air is cool. For a moment, I think about trying to escape, but there are more men around, all watching. They push me into a van. The doors slam shut, and it's dark again. I can feel the engine start, and we begin to move. I don't know where we're going or what's going to happen to me. I've never felt so helpless and scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart's pounding, just like it was then. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived that, so I can survive remembering it too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, though. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back there, you know? Like it's happening all over again. But then I remind myself that I'm here, that I'm safe now. It helps, but it's still a struggle.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly feel safe again. Like, completely safe, without always looking over my shoulder or jumping at every little noise. Will that ever happen?",
    "Therapist: It's possible. We'll work towards that together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to live my life without this constant fear. To be able to trust people again, to not see danger everywhere. It's exhausting, always being on guard.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's continue working through this.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready. Sometimes I think about the others who were there with me. I wonder if they made it out too, if they're okay. I feel guilty sometimes, that I got out and they might not have. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Survivor's guilt is common. It's not your fault.",
    "Client: I know that, logically. But emotionally, it's hard to accept. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently, if I could have helped someone else. But then I remember how powerless I felt, how scared I was. I couldn't even help myself, let alone anyone else.",
    "Therapist: You did what you needed to survive. That's important.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... it's all so overwhelming sometimes. The memories, the feelings, the guilt. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly be free of it all. But then I remember how far I've come, and I try to hold onto that.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. You've shown great resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. Sometimes I forget how strong I've been, how much I've overcome. It's easy to focus on the bad stuff and forget about the progress. But you're right, I have come a long way. I'm here, talking about it, facing it. That's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It's significant progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am, I think. Proud and grateful. Grateful to be here, to have this chance to heal. It's not easy, but it's worth it. I want to keep moving forward, to keep getting stronger. I don't want what happened to define me forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen, to validate what I'm feeling. Sometimes I feel like no one could possibly understand, but you... you help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: That means a lot to me. I know we still have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm on the right path. It's scary sometimes, facing all of this, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through it. That I can come out the other side stronger.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for today's session. It was tough, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of a tiny bit of the weight I've been carrying. I know we'll have to go through more of this, but I think I'm ready. I'm ready to keep facing it, to keep working towards healing.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
