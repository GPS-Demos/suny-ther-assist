    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is telling me to run. It's like my body knows what's coming and it's fighting me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our old house. The yellow one with the creaky porch. I can smell Mom's cooking - it's Sunday, so she's making jollof rice. I'm supposed to be doing homework, but I'm distracted by the shouting outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: There's a commotion in the street. I can hear raised voices, angry shouts. I'm curious, so I sneak to the window. I see... oh god, I see Mr. Adebayo from next door. He's drunk again, and he's got his wife by the arm. She's crying, begging him to stop.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment, James. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. My heart's racing. I want to help, but I'm just a kid. What can I do? I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. It's hard to stay here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mr. Adebayo, he... he slaps her. Hard. The sound echoes down the street. I flinch, but I can't look away. Mrs. Adebayo stumbles, but he doesn't let go of her arm. He's yelling something about money, about her being useless.",
    "Therapist: Stay present, James. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) I know, I know. It's just... God, I can still hear her cries. She's pleading with him, saying she'll do better. But he's not listening. He drags her towards their house, still shouting. I'm frozen at the window, my homework forgotten.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're observing, not reliving. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: I... I notice my little sister's doll on the floor. The curtains are moving slightly from the fan. And there's... there's the sound of my mom in the kitchen, humming as she cooks. It's such a contrast to what's happening outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. Focus on those details. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a crash from the Adebayos' house. Glass breaking. More shouting. I want to run and get my dad, but I'm afraid to move. What if Mr. Adebayo sees me? What if he comes for us next?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, James. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (Nods) Right, right. I... I stay at the window. Mrs. Adebayo comes out again, her face bruised. She's clutching her arm. She looks up and down the street, probably hoping someone will help. But everyone's inside. No one wants to get involved.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. Why isn't anyone helping her? Why am I just standing here? I'm... I'm shaking. My fists are clenched.",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid, James. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. Maybe even 90 now.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Mrs. Adebayo, she... she sees me in the window. Our eyes meet for a moment. There's so much pain in her eyes, so much desperation. I want to look away, but I can't. It's like she's begging me to do something, anything.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens?",
    "Client: I... I close the curtains. I can't bear it anymore. I slide down to the floor, my back against the wall. I can still hear them outside, but it's muffled now. I'm crying, but I don't make a sound. I don't want Mom to hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 75 now. I feel... I feel ashamed. I should have done something.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were just a child. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I wipe my eyes and force myself to go back to my homework. But I can't focus. The numbers blur on the page. I keep hearing Mrs. Adebayo's cries in my head. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, James. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Yeah, okay. I... I sit there for what feels like hours. Eventually, the shouting stops. The street goes quiet. But it's not a peaceful quiet. It's heavy, oppressive. Like everyone's holding their breath.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Relieved that it's over, but... also guilty. Like I should have done more. And scared. What if it happens again? What if next time, it's worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 now. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Later that night, at dinner, I want to tell my parents what happened. But the words won't come out. We eat in silence. I push my food around the plate, not really eating. Mom asks if I'm feeling okay, and I lie. I say I'm just tired.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry at myself. I should have said something. Maybe if I had, things would have been different.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were a child in a difficult situation. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 50. I'm starting to feel a bit detached from it all.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's continue. What happens after dinner?",
    "Client: I go to bed early, but I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see Mrs. Adebayo's face. I keep hearing the sound of that slap, the crash of breaking glass. I toss and turn all night.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, James. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The next morning, everything seems normal. Too normal. Like nothing happened. But when I look out the window, I see Mrs. Adebayo hanging laundry. She's wearing long sleeves despite the heat. I know why.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel helpless. Angry. Confused. Why is this allowed to happen? Why doesn't anyone stop it? I want to do something, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy feelings for a child to carry. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 40. I'm feeling more... I don't know, resigned maybe?",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well, James. Let's continue.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I'm on edge. Every raised voice, every slam of a door makes me jump. I start having nightmares. In them, I'm always trying to reach Mrs. Adebayo, but I can never get there in time.",
    "Therapist: How do these nightmares affect you?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel weak. Useless. Like I'm failing her over and over again. I start sleeping less, afraid to close my eyes. My grades start slipping. Mom and Dad notice, but I can't tell them why.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a heavy burden to carry alone.",
    "Client: It was. It is. I... I still carry it, I guess. That feeling of not being able to help, of being powerless. It's stayed with me all these years.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now, James?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 30. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. But... but I'm glad we did this. It's like... like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've finally put it down for a moment. It's still there, but it's not crushing me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step, James. You should be proud of yourself. Is there anything else you want to add before we end?",
    "Client: Just... just that I wish I could go back and tell that scared little boy that it wasn't his fault. That he did the best he could with what he knew at the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, James. Let's end here for today. You've done excellent work."
