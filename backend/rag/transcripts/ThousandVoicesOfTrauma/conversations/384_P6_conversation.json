    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I'm... I'm in the refugee camp. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell sweat and dust. There are so many people around me, all looking scared and lost. I'm holding my little brother's hand tightly. We're both so hungry...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The sun is beating down on us. It's so hot. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. There's a commotion near the food distribution area. People are pushing and shoving. I'm trying to protect my brother, but I'm getting jostled. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) Someone pushes me hard, and I lose my grip on my brother's hand. I'm calling out for him, but I can't see him in the crowd. I'm panicking. My chest feels tight, and I can't breathe properly. I'm so scared I've lost him...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. Can you continue?",
    "Client: (nods) I'm pushing through the crowd, desperately searching for my brother. People are yelling, some are crying. I spot a familiar t-shirt and rush towards it. It's him. I grab him and hold him close, feeling so relieved but also angry and helpless. We shouldn't be here. We should be home...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? My heart is still racing, but I feel a little calmer knowing I found him in the memory.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: (nods) We make our way to a quieter corner of the camp. I can see the fear in my brother's eyes. I'm trying to be strong for him, but inside I'm terrified. I don't know how long we'll be here or what will happen to us. I miss our parents. I miss our home. Everything feels so uncertain...",
