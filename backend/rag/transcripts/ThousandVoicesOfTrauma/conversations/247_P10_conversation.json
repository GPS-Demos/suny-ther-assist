    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Anderson. I'm... well, I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. This cyber bullying business, it's all so new to me. At my age, I never thought I'd be dealing with something like this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you describe where you are in the memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at home. In my living room. I've just opened my laptop to check my emails. It's a sunny afternoon, but I feel a heaviness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see a notification. It's from that community forum I joined... oh, my hands are starting to shake a bit. There's a thread about me. \"Look at this old lady trying to be cool,\" it says. There are cruel comments, doctored photos of me... I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7, I'd say. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Right, yes... I'm scrolling through the comments. They're making fun of my age, my appearance. Someone's shared personal information about me. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. I want to close the laptop, but I can't stop reading.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I see a comment from someone I thought was a friend. They've joined in, sharing an embarrassing story about me. I feel betrayed, humiliated. My chest feels tight, I'm struggling to breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Thank you. I'm... I'm calling for my husband now. My voice is shaky. He comes in and sees me crying. I can't even explain what's happening, I just point at the screen.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel so foolish. Like I don't belong in this modern world. I'm thinking about my grandchildren, wondering if they'd be ashamed of me. I'm wondering if I should just give up on trying to connect with people online.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: My husband is reading the comments now. He looks angry, protective. But I just feel small, insignificant. I'm remembering all the times in my life I've felt out of place, different because of my background. It's all flooding back.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Yes, you're right. I... I'm closing the laptop now. My hands are shaking so much I can barely do it. I feel drained, exhausted. My husband is trying to comfort me, but I feel so ashamed. I don't want him to see me like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I go to lie down. My head is pounding. I'm replaying all the comments in my mind, wondering what I did wrong, how I could have prevented this. I feel so naive, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at an 8. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I'm lying in bed now. I can hear my husband on the phone in the other room. He's talking to our daughter, explaining what happened. I feel a mix of gratitude and embarrassment. Part of me wants to hide away forever, never go online again. But another part feels angry, defiant. Why should I let these bullies win?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I sit up in bed. I'm thinking about my life, all I've been through. Immigrating to this country, building a life here, raising a family. I've faced discrimination before, but this feels different, more personal somehow.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My chest is still tight, but my breathing is a bit easier. My hands have stopped shaking. I feel... I feel drained, but also like there's a fire building inside me.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm getting up now. I walk back to the living room. My husband looks worried, but I tell him I want to respond to the bullies. Not to engage with them directly, but to write a post about cyber bullying and its impact on older adults. I feel scared, but also determined.",
    "Therapist: That sounds empowering. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6 now. I still feel shaky, but there's a sense of purpose too.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm sitting at the computer again. My hands are trembling as I type, but I keep going. I'm writing about my experiences, my feelings. I'm thinking about other older adults who might be going through the same thing. I feel... I feel like I'm turning this horrible experience into something meaningful.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... it feels good. Scary, but good. Like I'm taking back some control. My heart is still racing, but it's different now. More like excitement than fear.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5 now. I still feel shaken, but there's a sense of hope too.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I feel drained, but also like I've accomplished something. Is it normal to feel this mix of emotions?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great resilience.",
    "Client: I... I never thought I'd be dealing with something like this at my age. But I suppose life never stops throwing challenges at us, does it? I'm... I'm grateful for my family's support. And for these sessions. They're helping me process all of this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I'm feeling tired, but also a bit proud of myself. Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side. My heart rate has slowed down now, and the tightness in my chest is almost gone.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 now. I feel... I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Mrs. Patel. You've shown great courage."
