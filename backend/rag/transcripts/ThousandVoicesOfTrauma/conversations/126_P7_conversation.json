    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my experience with cyber bullying, and it's bringing up some uncomfortable memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... thinking about that time in the hospital and then dealing with the online harassment afterward, it's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great by opening up. Can you tell me more about that experience?",
    "Client: Well, it started when I had to have emergency surgery for appendicitis. I was already scared about the procedure, but then things got complicated. I woke up in so much pain, and the doctors were talking about infection risks. I felt so vulnerable and alone.",
    "Therapist: That sounds frightening. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: It was terrifying. And then, when I finally got home and posted about my experience on social media, hoping for some support, that's when the cyber bullying started. Someone I thought was a friend started making cruel jokes about my situation, saying I was exaggerating for attention.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry you went through that. How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: It felt like a betrayal. I was already feeling physically weak and emotionally drained from the medical ordeal, and then to have someone mock my pain online... it was devastating. Other people joined in, questioning if I was really that sick, suggesting I was being dramatic.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly hurtful. You're doing well, describing these difficult moments.",
    "Client: It was. I remember lying in bed, still recovering, and just crying as I read the comments. I felt so isolated and misunderstood. The physical pain from the surgery was bad enough, but the emotional pain from the bullying... it was almost unbearable.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. In the hospital, I was at the mercy of the doctors and my own body. Then online, I felt like I had no control over what people were saying about me. It was like being trapped in a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by confronting these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know it's important. The worst part was feeling like I couldn't trust anyone. The medical trauma left me feeling betrayed by my own body, and then the cyber bullying made me doubt my friendships and my entire online support network.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. Sad, angry, but also... maybe a little relieved to be talking about it? It's like a weight I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I think what hurts the most is how the cyber bullying compounded the medical trauma. I was already feeling vulnerable and scared from the surgery complications, and then to have people online dismissing my experience or making fun of it... it made me feel like I wasn't allowed to be in pain or ask for support.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. It's okay to have needed support.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I've spent so long doubting myself, wondering if I was overreacting. But the truth is, it really did hurt. Both the physical pain from the surgery and the emotional pain from the bullying. I've been carrying this for years, afraid to open up about it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage today. How do you feel about sharing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but also kind of freeing? I've never really talked about how these two experiences - the medical trauma and the cyber bullying - are connected for me. It's like I'm finally acknowledging how much it all affected me.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think I am. It's still painful to think about, but talking about it here, where I feel safe... it's helping me see that I'm not alone in this anymore. That what happened to me wasn't okay, and it's alright to still be affected by it.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your feelings are completely valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'm starting to understand that now. It's been a long journey, but being here, talking about it... I feel like I'm finally starting to process everything that happened.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like I've finally started to let go of something I've been holding onto for too long. It's scary, but also kind of liberating.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I think I am. For the first time in a long while, I feel like I might be able to move past this. Not forget it, but... not let it control me anymore. Thank you for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done the hard work here. Well done, Maria."
