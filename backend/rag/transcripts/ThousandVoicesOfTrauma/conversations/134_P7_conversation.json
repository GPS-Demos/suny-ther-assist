    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the car accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work. It was raining heavily, and visibility was poor. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, feeling tense. The roads were slick, and I was worried about hydroplaning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As I approached an intersection, the light turned yellow. I thought I could make it, so I sped up a little. But then... I saw headlights coming from my left. They were moving fast, too fast. I realized they weren't going to stop.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I froze. My heart started racing. I wanted to hit the brakes, but my foot wouldn't move. The other car was getting closer and closer. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\"",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: The impact was... it was like nothing I've ever felt before. There was a deafening crash, and I felt my body jerk violently. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. Everything was spinning, and I could taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What do you remember feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. And then... pain. My chest hurt from the seatbelt, and my head was throbbing. I could hear people shouting outside, but it all seemed far away. I was just... frozen in my seat, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I remember smelling gasoline. That's when panic really set in. I thought the car might explode. I tried to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands were shaking so badly. I couldn't get it to release.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Someone came to my window. They were asking if I was okay, but I couldn't respond. I just stared at them, my mind blank. It felt like I was watching everything happen to someone else, not me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you feel then?",
    "Client: Helpless. Completely helpless. And ashamed. I kept thinking I should have stopped at the yellow light. This was all my fault. People could have died because of me.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not at fault. Continue.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrived. They were asking me questions, shining lights in my eyes. I remember feeling so confused and disoriented. They put a neck brace on me and carefully extracted me from the car. I was terrified of moving, afraid I might be badly injured.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happened next?",
    "Client: They loaded me into the ambulance. The sirens were so loud. I kept asking about the other driver, but no one would give me a straight answer. I was convinced I had killed someone. The guilt was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur of tests and questions. I had a concussion, bruised ribs, and whiplash. But all I could think about was the other driver. When they finally told me he was okay, I broke down crying. The relief was... indescribable.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard to talk about. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But... I also feel a sense of relief. Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to let it go.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still painful, but... I feel like I'm starting to process it. Like maybe, eventually, I'll be able to move past this.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to continue. It's difficult, but I can see how facing this memory might help me in the long run. I want to get better, to not let this accident control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive attitude. Shall we continue exploring?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. There's more I want to talk about... like the nightmares I've been having since the accident. They're so vivid, and they always end the same way - with me trapped in the car, unable to escape.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Let's explore those nightmares.",
    "Client: In the nightmares, I'm back in the car, but everything is more intense. The rain is deafening, and the other car's headlights are blinding. I try to turn the wheel, to avoid the collision, but my arms won't move. It's like I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The crash happens in slow motion. I can see the other car coming towards me, can see the driver's terrified face. But I can't do anything. Then there's the impact, and I feel every second of it. The crushing metal, the shattering glass...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After the crash, in the dream, I'm always trapped. The car starts to sink into water that wasn't there before. I can't unbuckle my seatbelt, can't break the windows. I'm drowning, and I can see people standing on the shore, just watching. Not helping.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. My heart is pounding just talking about it. But there's also a strange sense of relief. Like by saying it out loud, I'm taking away some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think... I think I understand now why these nightmares keep happening. It's all my fears rolled into one - the fear of the accident itself, the fear of being helpless, the fear of no one coming to save me. It's like my brain is trying to process everything at once.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does this realization affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... I don't know, maybe a little more in control? Like now that I can see the pattern, maybe I can start to break it. It's still scary, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I do. I want to talk about how this has affected my daily life. I haven't driven since the accident. The thought of getting behind the wheel... it terrifies me. But at the same time, I feel so dependent on others now. It's frustrating.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's explore those feelings.",
    "Client: Every time I see a car, I tense up. My palms get sweaty, my heart races. Even as a passenger, I'm constantly on edge, watching for potential dangers. I know it's not rational, but I can't help it. I feel like I've lost my independence, my freedom.",
    "Therapist: You're being very honest. That's commendable.",
    "Client: It's affecting my relationship too. My partner is so patient, but I can tell it's wearing on them. Having to drive me everywhere, dealing with my anxiety... I feel like a burden. And I hate feeling this way. I want to be the person I was before the accident.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel frustrated. You're working towards change.",
    "Client: I am. And talking about it like this... it's hard, but I think it's helping. I want to get better. I want to be able to drive again, to not let fear control my life. I know it won't happen overnight, but for the first time in a while, I feel like it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to stop for now. This has been intense, but in a good way. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. How would you like to conclude?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths, maybe talk about some positive things I can focus on for the rest of the day. This session has been heavy, but I don't want to leave feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's a wise approach. Let's do that."
