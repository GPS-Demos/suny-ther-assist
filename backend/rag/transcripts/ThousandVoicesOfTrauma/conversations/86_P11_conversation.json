    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's... it's been difficult, Dr. Roberts. Reliving those moments from the refugee camp... I can still feel the fear and uncertainty. The way the guards would look at us, it... it brings back so much.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sounds. The constant noise of people crying, children calling for their parents. And the smell... the overwhelming stench of too many people crammed together. It's like I was right back there again.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt so tense. My hands were shaking, just like they did back then. I... I didn't realize how much I still carried this with me.",
    "Therapist: That's common. What thoughts came up?",
    "Client: (pauses) I kept thinking, \"Will I survive this? Will I ever feel safe again?\" It's strange, because I know I'm safe now, but in that moment, it all felt so real and threatening.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: (sighs) I suppose... I'm always on edge, aren't I? Always waiting for something bad to happen. Even here, living with my daughter and her family, I sometimes feel like I need to be ready to run at a moment's notice.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How else?",
    "Client: Well, I... I struggle to trust people, especially those in authority. And loud noises... they still make me jump. It's like a part of me is stuck in that camp.",
    "Therapist: You're making connections. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Understanding where these feelings come from, it helps somehow. Makes me feel less... broken, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to work on feeling safer in the present. Maybe... maybe I can start by reminding myself that I'm not in danger anymore when I feel scared. And perhaps... talk to my family about this? They've always wondered why I get so anxious sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Could we... could we practice some ways to ground myself when the memories feel too intense? And maybe... discuss how I might approach talking to my family about this?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next time. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for far too long. Thank you, Dr. Roberts. I... I know this isn't easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mrs. Johnson. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
