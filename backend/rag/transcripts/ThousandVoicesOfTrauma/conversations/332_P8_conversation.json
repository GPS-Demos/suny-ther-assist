    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. It's like my body is shaking on the inside, but I'm frozen on the outside. The memory of that night, the home invasion... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" I was paralyzed with fear, hiding in my closet. I feel so ashamed. I should have called for help or tried to escape. But I just... froze. And now, reliving it, I feel that same helplessness washing over me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you share this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for danger all over again, even though I know I'm safe here. It's exhausting, feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Mostly fear and anger. Fear because I feel so vulnerable, like it could happen again at any moment. And anger... anger at the intruders, but also at myself for not being stronger. It's frustrating because logically, I know I did what I had to do to survive, but emotionally, I still feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... intense, but different. Back then, it was pure terror. Now, it's like a mix of fear, anger, and this deep sadness. I'm mourning the sense of safety I lost that night. Every creak in my apartment sets me on edge now. I hate that they took that peace from me.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm able to talk about it more. Before, I'd just shut down when I thought about that night. Now, even though it's painful, I can put it into words. That feels like progress, but it's also scary. It's like by talking about it, I'm making it real all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to your broader journey?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. This home invasion brought back a lot of feelings from the sexual abuse I experienced as a child. That same helplessness, the violation of my safe space. But facing this memory head-on, it's like I'm reclaiming some of the power I lost. It's terrifying, but also... empowering, in a way?",
    "Therapist: What's giving you strength in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... it's the fact that I'm here, talking about it. For so long, I tried to bury these memories. But now, even though it hurts, I'm confronting them. And each time I do, it gets a little easier. I'm starting to believe that maybe I am strong enough to get through this.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this impacting your future?",
    "Client: I... I hope it means I'll be able to feel safe again someday. Right now, that seems impossible. But if I can sit here and talk about one of the worst nights of my life without falling apart completely, maybe I can learn to trust again. To not always be looking over my shoulder. It's a long road, but for the first time, I can see a glimmer of hope at the end of it.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I just need a moment to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm doing the work to heal. It's overwhelming, but I'm proud of myself for getting through this session. I never thought I'd be able to face these memories head-on like this.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. How can we support you?",
    "Client: Just... knowing that I have a safe space here helps. And maybe... could we end with some grounding exercises? I want to leave feeling more present in my body, not stuck in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know this process is difficult, but I'm starting to believe it's worth it. Each time we do this, I feel a little stronger, a little more in control. It's like I'm slowly reclaiming pieces of myself that I thought were lost forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Shall we begin the grounding?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm ready."
