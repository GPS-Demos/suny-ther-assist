    "Therapist: Welcome, Ms. Chen. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting those war experiences... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to be as difficult as I'm imagining?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your combat experiences in a safe environment. It helps process trauma memories.",
    "Client: That sounds terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget those experiences. Why would we deliberately bring them up?",
    "Therapist: Avoidance often prolongs PTSD. Facing memories can reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: I understand the logic, but... God, I'm scared. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are normal. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what exactly will happen during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe a traumatic event in detail, in present tense, as if reliving it.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. Will I... will I be able to stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I'm still nervous, but knowing I have some control helps. What should I expect to feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions, physical sensations. It's part of the process.",
    "Client: Strong emotions I can understand, but physical sensations? Like what?",
    "Therapist: Perhaps increased heart rate, sweating, tension. We'll manage these together.",
    "Client: I see. It sounds... challenging. But I suppose that's the point, isn't it? To face these difficult memories head-on?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your willingness to engage shows tremendous courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I don't feel very courageous right now, but I'm trying. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies, but typically several sessions. We'll assess your progress regularly.",
    "Client: Several sessions... okay. I can do this. I've survived worse, right? Is there anything I should do to prepare?",
    "Therapist: Just bring your willingness to participate. You're doing great already.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your guidance and support. I'm still scared, but I'm ready to try. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's start before I lose my nerve. I'm as ready as I'll ever be."
