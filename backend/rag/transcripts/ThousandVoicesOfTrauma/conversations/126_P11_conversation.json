    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of the medical procedure again, it's like I was right back there in that cold, sterile room. I could almost smell the antiseptic. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. I remember lying there, unable to move, and the doctors were discussing my case as if I wasn't even there. It's like... I lost all agency over my own body. And now, with this cyberbullying situation... it's bringing up similar feelings. Like I have no control over what people say or do online.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding medical check-ups since then. And now, with the cyberbullying, I'm constantly on edge when I'm online. I keep checking my social media, expecting to see more hurtful comments. It's exhausting, you know? I feel like I can't escape these feelings of vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What helped you get through the memory today?",
    "Client: I... I tried to remind myself that I'm safe now. That it's just a memory. And I focused on my breathing, like we practiced. It helped a little, but it's still hard. I keep thinking about how this trauma has affected my life, how it's made me so cautious and anxious all the time.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels proud that I can face these memories now without completely falling apart. But another part of me is frustrated that it still affects me so much. I want to move past this, to not let it control my life anymore. Especially with this new cyberbullying situation, I don't want to let it add to my trauma.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's one thing you've learned?",
    "Client: I think... I'm learning that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face these memories and still be okay. And maybe, just maybe, I can apply that strength to dealing with the cyberbullying too. It's all about regaining that sense of control, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How might you use this insight moving forward?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I can start small. Like, schedule a routine check-up with a doctor I trust. And for the cyberbullying, perhaps I can set boundaries online, limit my social media time. It's scary, but I want to reclaim my life, both offline and online.",
    "Therapist: That's a great approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, honestly. But also... hopeful? It's like, for the first time in a while, I can see a path forward. It's not easy, and I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally taking steps in the right direction. Both with processing my medical trauma and dealing with this new cyberbullying situation.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For guiding me through this, for helping me see things differently. I know it's going to be a journey, but I feel more equipped to handle it now. I'm nervous about the next session, about diving deeper into these memories and feelings, but I'm also... kind of looking forward to it? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows your commitment. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel emotionally drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important today. I'm going to try to be gentle with myself for the rest of the day, maybe do some of those self-care activities we talked about. And I'll keep working on those breathing exercises too. They really do help, especially when I start feeling overwhelmed by memories or anxious about the cyberbullying.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you then. And... thanks again for everything. I know it's your job, but it really means a lot to have someone guiding me through this. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can overcome this and not let my past traumas or current challenges define me. It's a small step, but it feels like a significant one."
