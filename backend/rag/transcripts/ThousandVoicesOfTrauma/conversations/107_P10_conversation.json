    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Lim. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the animal attack, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's... let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the park near my apartment. It's a warm day, and I can smell the flowers blooming. I decided to take a walk after lunch, something I often do to clear my head. The path is winding through some trees, and I can hear birds chirping...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear a rustling in the bushes. At first, I think it's just a squirrel or something small. But then... oh god... I see these eyes. Yellow eyes, staring right at me from the undergrowth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart... it's pounding so hard. I feel frozen, like I can't move. I want to run, but my legs won't listen to me.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The animal, it... it lunges out of the bushes. It's a large dog, maybe a German Shepherd mix. Its teeth are bared, and it's growling. I finally manage to move, but I stumble backward and fall.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. I can't believe this is happening. I'm too old to defend myself against a dog attack. I keep thinking about my grandchildren, how I might never see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay present in that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog... it's on top of me now. I can feel its hot breath on my face, smell the... the rankness of it. I try to protect my face with my arms, but it's so strong. It's biting at my arms, my shoulders. The pain is... it's excruciating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 85. I can almost feel the pain again.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Can you tell me what you see and hear around you?",
    "Client: I... I see the trees above me. The sky is so blue, it seems wrong for something so terrible to be happening. I can hear myself screaming, but it sounds far away, like it's not really me. There are other voices too, people shouting.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens then?",
    "Client: Someone... a man, I think... he comes running. He's yelling at the dog, trying to pull it off me. I feel the weight lift, but I'm still so scared. I can't move. I'm just lying there, shaking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved, but also in shock. My arms are bleeding, and I can feel this throbbing pain all over. But mostly, I just feel... numb. Like this isn't really happening to me.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. What do you do next?",
    "Client: People are gathering around me. Someone's calling an ambulance. A woman takes off her jacket and presses it against my arm to stop the bleeding. I want to thank her, but I can't seem to form words.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. Remembering the help makes it a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics are talking to me, but I'm having trouble focusing on what they're saying. They lift me onto a stretcher, and I remember feeling embarrassed about causing such a scene. As they're loading me into the ambulance, I see animal control arriving to deal with the dog.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you're in the ambulance?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying the attack in my mind. I'm wondering if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had noticed the dog earlier, or if I hadn't fallen... And then I start worrying about how this will affect my independence. Will I be too scared to go for walks now?",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal thoughts after such an experience. What happens at the hospital?",
    "Client: They clean and stitch up my wounds. The doctor tells me I'm lucky - the bites didn't hit any major arteries. But I don't feel lucky. I feel... violated. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel now, as you're recalling it?",
    "Client: It makes me angry. And sad. I've always been independent, and now I feel like that's been taken away from me.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's around 50. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens after you're treated?",
    "Client: My daughter arrives at the hospital. She's frantic, asking so many questions. I try to reassure her, but I can see the worry in her eyes. She insists I stay with her for a few days, and I don't have the energy to argue.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about accepting her help?",
    "Client: Part of me is grateful, but another part feels... diminished. Like I'm not capable of taking care of myself anymore. It's a struggle between needing support and wanting to maintain my independence.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What happens in the days following the attack?",
    "Client: I have nightmares. Almost every night, I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling the dog's teeth on me. During the day, I jump at every little noise. My daughter tries to get me to go for a short walk, but I can't bring myself to leave the house.",
    "Therapist: How does this change in your behavior affect you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel like a prisoner in my own life. I've always been active, social. Now I'm afraid to even check the mail. I feel like I'm letting fear control me, but I don't know how to stop it.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: It's about 40 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm regaining some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Can you tell me about any positive moments or realizations you've had since the attack?",
    "Client: Well... I've been overwhelmed by the support from my family and friends. My grandchildren made me cards, and my neighbors have been bringing over meals. It reminds me that there's still a lot of good in the world, even if one bad thing happened to me.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive perspective. How does recognizing that support make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... loved. And maybe a little stronger. Like maybe I can get through this, with their help.",
    "Therapist: That's a great realization. As we're nearing the end of our session, how are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way. Like I've done something difficult but important. And I feel a little lighter, like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mrs. Lim. What's your final distress level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to about 25 now. It's still there, but it feels more manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session."
