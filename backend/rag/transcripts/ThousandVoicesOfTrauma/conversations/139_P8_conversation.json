    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm back there again, seeing those messages pop up on my screen. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. Like, these strangers online had all this control over me. They were sharing those pictures, saying such horrible things. I remember thinking, \"This is never going to end. My life is over.\" It's stupid, but part of me still believes that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you recall those thoughts?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense. I notice I'm clenching my fists. There's this knot in my stomach, like I'm going to be sick. It's hard to breathe normally. I just want to curl up and disappear, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds really intense. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Shame. So much shame. And anger, too. I'm furious at those people who did this to me, but I'm also angry at myself. I keep thinking I should have known better, should have been more careful. And there's this overwhelming sense of fear, like it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the cyberbullying was happening?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as intense now. Back then, it was like I was drowning in these emotions. Now, it's more like... waves, I guess? They come and go. Sometimes they're big and overwhelming, but other times they're smaller, more manageable. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about those waves?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... some days I feel almost okay. I can go about my life, interact with people online without panicking. But then something will trigger me - a notification sound, or seeing someone share a personal photo - and suddenly I'm right back in that headspace. The fear and shame just wash over me. It's exhausting, always being on guard like this.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope when those waves hit?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself that I'm safe now. That what happened wasn't my fault. Sometimes I'll call my partner or a friend, just to hear a friendly voice. Other times, I'll do those grounding exercises we've practiced. But honestly? Sometimes I still just shut down. I'll disconnect from everything and everyone for a while.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's different now compared to before our sessions?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to believe that I can get through this. Before, it felt like this dark cloud that would never lift. Now, even when I have bad days, there's this tiny voice reminding me that it won't last forever. And I'm learning to recognize my triggers, which helps. It's still hard, but... I don't feel as helpless anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... weird, actually. Part of me feels proud, like I'm finally taking back some control. But there's also this guilt, you know? Like, should I be feeling better already? Am I minimizing what happened? And there's still this fear that if I let my guard down, something bad will happen again.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What do you think about that fear?",
    "Client: I guess... I know logically that what happened wasn't my fault, and that I'm taking steps to protect myself now. But emotionally? It's hard to shake that fear. It's like this constant whisper in the back of my mind, telling me to be careful, don't trust anyone, keep my walls up. I want to move past it, but it feels like such a huge mountain to climb.",
    "Therapist: How does that impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It affects everything, honestly. I'm always second-guessing myself before posting anything online. I've cut off contact with a lot of people because I'm afraid they might have seen those pictures or heard the rumors. Even at work, I'm paranoid that my coworkers might find out somehow. It's like I'm living a double life - trying to act normal on the outside while constantly panicking on the inside.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to overcome this fear?",
    "Client: God, it would mean everything. To be able to just... exist, you know? Without this constant weight on my shoulders. To use social media without having a panic attack. To form new relationships without worrying that they'll find out my \"secret\" and judge me. To feel like I have a future that isn't defined by this one horrible experience. It seems impossible right now, but... I want that so badly.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How might we work towards it?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess continuing these exposure exercises, as hard as they are. Maybe... maybe trying to open up to more people in my life about what happened? That terrifies me, but I know isolating myself isn't helping. And I think I need to work on forgiving myself. That's the hardest part - I still blame myself so much for what happened.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent insights. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also, there's this tiny spark of hope? Like, talking through all of this... it's painful, but it also makes it feel a bit less overwhelming. Like maybe, just maybe, I can actually get through this and come out the other side. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of your resilience. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was intense, but... good, I think. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also kind of... ready? If that makes sense. Ready to keep working on this, even when it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next session."
