    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Tom?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of my boss yelling at me in front of everyone... it's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The shame, I think. I could feel my face getting hot, just like it did that day. And the way everyone was staring at me... God, I wanted to disappear. It's funny, I thought I was over it, but reliving it brought all those feelings rushing back.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge at work now. Even when things are going fine, I'm constantly worried about messing up or being called out. It's exhausting, really. I never realized how much that incident affected me until now.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I felt so... small. Powerless. Like I was a kid again, being scolded by my dad. It's weird, but I had this flash of a memory from when I was young, my dad yelling at me for spilling milk. The feelings were so similar.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting connection. How does that insight feel?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, I guess. And a bit overwhelming. I never thought these things could be related. It makes me wonder how much of my anxiety at work is actually about my childhood stuff.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I need to work on setting boundaries? Or... learning to stand up for myself? It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always trying to please everyone so I don't get yelled at again.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like valuable goals. How might you start working on that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I could practice speaking up more in low-stakes situations? Like, giving my opinion in a team meeting or something. And maybe... I don't know, reminding myself that I'm an adult now, not that scared kid anymore?",
    "Therapist: Those are great ideas. How are you feeling about the process now?",
    "Client: It's tough, not gonna lie. But... I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. It's scary, but also kind of... empowering? Like, now that I can see these patterns, maybe I can actually do something about them.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Tom. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I need to be kinder to myself. And maybe... maybe it's okay to make mistakes sometimes. I'm not that powerless kid anymore, and my boss isn't my dad. I can handle criticism without it destroying me. At least, I want to believe that.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard, but... I think it's worth it. I want to feel more confident at work, in my relationships... just in life, you know? If facing these memories helps me get there, then I'm willing to keep going. It's just... it's a lot sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It is a lot. Remember, we're here to support you through this journey.",
    "Client: Thanks, I really appreciate that. It helps to know I'm not alone in this. Sometimes after these sessions, I feel so drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. It's a weird mix of exhaustion and relief.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How will you take care of yourself after today's session?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my place. Being in nature always helps me feel more grounded. And maybe I'll call my friend Sarah later. She's always good at making me laugh when I need it.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great self-care strategies. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm good for now. Just... thanks for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. Slow progress, but still... it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Every step counts. I'm proud of your hard work today, Tom.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm trying. It's just... sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back, you know? But I guess that's still moving forward in the end.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful way to look at it. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I've got a lot to think about. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Tom."
