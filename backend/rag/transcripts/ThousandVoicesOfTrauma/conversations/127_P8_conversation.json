    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see their faces, you know? The way they looked at me, sneering and laughing. It's making my stomach churn just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't take a full breath. And my heart... it's beating so fast. I feel like I'm back there in that moment, cornered in the school hallway.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why me? Why did they target me? Was it just because I look different? I mean, I know I'm not from here originally, but I've lived in this country most of my life. I speak the language perfectly. I... I just don't understand why they saw me as so different, so... alien.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Confused. Sad. It's this mix of emotions that I can't quite untangle. Part of me wants to scream at them, tell them how wrong they are. But another part... it's like I start to believe what they're saying. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I am different in a bad way.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that belief?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's not really logical, is it? I mean, objectively, I know I have as much right to be here as anyone else. But in those moments, when I'm reliving it, it's like all reason goes out the window. I just feel small and... and worthless.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of worthlessness manifest?",
    "Client: It's like this heavy weight on my shoulders. I find myself hunching over, trying to make myself smaller. I avoid eye contact with people, especially if they look different from me. I've even caught myself trying to hide my accent sometimes, which is ridiculous because I barely have one!",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you share this?",
    "Client: I feel... ashamed, I guess. Ashamed that I let their words affect me so much. That even now, years later, I'm still carrying this weight around. But there's also a bit of anger bubbling up. Not just at them, but at myself for not standing up to them more.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a fire in my gut. My fists are clenching without me even realizing it. I want to... I don't know, punch something? But at the same time, I'm scared of that feeling. I've always tried to be the \"good immigrant,\" you know? Never causing trouble, always polite. What if giving in to this anger makes me just like them?",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that fear?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me knows it's not the same. They were bullies, targeting someone for no reason. If I stand up for myself, that's different, right? But there's still this voice in my head telling me to keep my head down, to not make waves.",
    "Therapist: How does that voice affect you?",
    "Client: It holds me back. In school, in my job, even in my relationships. I'm always second-guessing myself, wondering if I'm \"too foreign\" or if I'm going to say or do something wrong. It's exhausting, constantly monitoring myself like that.",
    "Therapist: What would it be like to challenge that voice?",
    "Client: Terrifying. But... maybe a little liberating too? I imagine standing up straight, looking people in the eye without fear. Being proud of who I am and where I come from. It sounds nice, but it also feels so far away from where I am now.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could start by talking more about my culture with my friends? Or wearing clothes that reflect my heritage sometimes? It's small, but it feels like a big step.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But there's a little spark of excitement too. Like maybe I could reclaim some of what those bullies took from me. It's scary, but... I think I want to try.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I think... I think having someone to talk to about it would help. Maybe you could help me practice what to say if someone asks about my clothes or my culture? And... I might need some encouragement to actually follow through.",
    "Therapist: Of course. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still a bit shaky, to be honest. But there's also this sense of... possibility? Like maybe I'm not doomed to feel this way forever. It's a small thing, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on challenging that inner voice. Maybe we could practice some scenarios where I stand up for myself? And... maybe explore more about my identity and how to embrace it fully.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling okay. A bit drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a little bit of the weight I've been carrying. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
