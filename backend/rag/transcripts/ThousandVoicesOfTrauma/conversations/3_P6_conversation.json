    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the commune's main hall. It's dimly lit, and there's a crowd gathered. The air feels thick, almost suffocating. I can smell incense burning, and there's a low hum of whispered conversations.",
    "Therapist: What's happening?",
    "Client: The leader is speaking. His voice is... hypnotic. He's talking about loyalty, about sacrifice. I feel uneasy, like something's not right. My stomach is churning.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The leader's voice is getting louder. He's singling out someone in the crowd - a young woman. She looks terrified. He's accusing her of betrayal. I... I can see tears streaming down her face. My heart is racing now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The crowd is getting agitated. There's a lot of murmuring, some people are shouting. The leader is demanding that the woman be punished. I feel frozen, like I can't move. My palms are sweating, and I'm finding it hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7? I feel really anxious, like I want to run away.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... The leader is calling for volunteers to carry out the punishment. I see people I know, friends even, stepping forward. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to stop them, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're... they're dragging her to the front. She's screaming, begging for help. I can see the terror in her eyes. I... I can't believe this is happening. My whole body is shaking now.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: *voice trembling* They start hitting her. The sound of it... I'll never forget it. People are cheering. I feel like I'm going to be sick. I want to help her, but I'm too scared. I hate myself for not doing anything.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: It goes on for what feels like hours. When they finally stop, she's barely conscious. They drag her away, and the leader starts talking about purification and loyalty again. I feel numb, disconnected. Like this can't be real.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. I feel so guilty, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal feelings. Remember, you weren't responsible for their actions.",
    "Client: I know, but... I just stood there. I did nothing. The crowd starts to disperse, but I can't move. I'm rooted to the spot, trembling. I feel like I've lost a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Exhausted. My SUDS is probably down to a 6, but I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've done really well today.",
    "Client: *sighs* Thank you. It's still so vivid, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: That's common with traumatic memories. How are you feeling about discussing this?",
    "Client: It's hard, but... I think it's helping. I've never really talked about it in detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll work through this together."
