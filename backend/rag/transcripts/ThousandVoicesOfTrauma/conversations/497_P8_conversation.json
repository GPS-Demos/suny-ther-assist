    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking, and it's making me feel really on edge.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, I should have been able to protect myself, you know? But I just froze. I couldn't move, couldn't think. And now, even though I know I'm safe here, there's this voice in my head telling me I'm weak, that I'll never be safe again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I can feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body's preparing for something bad to happen, even though logically I know I'm okay here. I just can't seem to relax.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Mostly fear, I think. But there's also this... anger. I'm angry at those men who broke in, angry at myself for not doing more. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness. Like, something was taken from me that night, and I don't know if I'll ever get it back.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I suppose. When it first happened, I was completely overwhelmed. I couldn't function for days. Now, it's still hard, but I can at least talk about it without completely breaking down. But the fear, it's still there, just under the surface.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, aren't I? That's something. Before, I couldn't even think about what happened without having a panic attack. Now, I can at least talk about it. And I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we've practiced. They help a bit, but it's still really hard.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience fitting into your broader recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me feels like I'm making progress, you know? Like, being able to face this memory without completely falling apart is a step forward. But then there's another part of me that's frustrated. I want to be 'over it' already, even though I know that's not how it works. It's like two steps forward, one step back sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has helped you get to this point?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's been a combination of things. These sessions, for one. Being able to talk about it in a safe space has been huge. And learning those coping strategies has helped too. I've also been trying to reconnect with friends, which has been scary but good. It reminds me that there's more to my life than just this trauma.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. Every time we do one of these exercises, part of me wants to run away and never come back. But I also know that I can't keep living in fear. I want my life back, you know? So even though it's terrifying, I want to keep going. I have to believe that it'll get easier with time.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's the small changes I've noticed. Like, last week, I was able to watch a movie with a break-in scene without having a panic attack. It wasn't comfortable, but I got through it. And sometimes, I catch myself feeling almost normal for a moment or two. Those moments give me hope that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your view of yourself?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. In some ways, I feel weaker, more vulnerable. Like I said before, I feel angry at myself for not doing more during the break-in. But then, there's another part of me that recognizes how strong I've been just to survive this, to keep going. I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe that counts for something.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on those moments when I feel triggered in daily life. Like, how to handle it when I hear a loud noise or when someone comes up behind me unexpectedly. I want to feel more in control in those situations.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit drained, to be honest. Talking about this always takes a lot out of me. But I also feel a bit lighter, like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying. It's exhausting, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What will you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps me feel a bit more grounded. And then maybe I'll call a friend, just to chat about normal things. I need that balance, you know? To remind myself that there's more to life than this trauma.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This isn't easy, but... I'm grateful for the help. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. See you then."
