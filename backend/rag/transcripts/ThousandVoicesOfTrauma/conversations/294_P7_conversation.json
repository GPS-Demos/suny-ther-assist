    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from class one night. It was dark, and I saw a police car pull up beside me. Two officers got out and approached me. They asked what I was doing out so late. I explained I was a student heading home from the library. They didn't believe me and demanded to see my ID. I reached for my bag, and suddenly one of them grabbed my arm roughly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I was shocked and scared. I tried to explain I was just getting my ID, but the officer twisted my arm behind my back. It hurt so much. I started crying and begging them to stop. The other officer started searching my bag without permission. I felt so violated and helpless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. You're being very brave.",
    "Client: They found my student ID, but they didn't apologize. Instead, they told me I should be more cooperative next time. I was shaking and sobbing. My arm was throbbing. I felt so angry and humiliated. I couldn't believe this was happening to me just for walking home.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: After they left, I couldn't move for a while. I was frozen on the sidewalk, trying to process what had just happened. When I finally got home, I broke down completely. I had bruises on my arm for days. I was too scared to go out at night for weeks after that. I still get anxious when I see police cars.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about this. I feel like I'm back there, feeling so small and powerless. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently, but I know I didn't do anything wrong. It's not fair. Why did they target me? I've always been taught to trust the police, but now I'm terrified of them.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part is, I didn't report it. I was too scared and ashamed. I thought no one would believe me. I still feel guilty about that. What if they did this to someone else? But I was just so overwhelmed and afraid. I couldn't sleep properly for months. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw their faces, felt that grip on my arm. It's like it's burned into my memory.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Sometimes I get so angry thinking about it. Other times, I just feel numb. It's affected my studies, my relationships. I find it hard to trust people now, especially authority figures. I used to love going for walks at night to clear my head, but now I'm too paranoid. It's like they took away my sense of safety in my own neighborhood.",
    "Therapist: You're being very courageous. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... shaky. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. Talking about it brings back all those intense emotions. But at the same time, there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I'm finally acknowledging how much this affected me instead of trying to push it down.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I think I need a moment. This is harder than I thought it would be. But I also feel like I need to keep talking about it, to process it somehow. Is it okay if we take a short break and then continue?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
