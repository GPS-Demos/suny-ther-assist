    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there in that meeting room, you know? I can still hear my boss's voice, that condescending tone he always used. It's making me feel small all over again.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't get a full breath. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, like I'm expecting someone to come in and start criticizing me at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his words... \"You're not cut out for this job,\" \"Why can't you be more like your coworkers?\" It's making me doubt myself all over again. Am I really as incompetent as he made me feel? Maybe I'm just not good enough for any decent job. I know logically that's not true, but emotionally... it's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I guess... it's not just about that job, is it? It's bringing up all these feelings of inadequacy that I've struggled with for years. My dad used to criticize me in a similar way, always comparing me to others. This workplace situation just reinforced all those old insecurities. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone to point out how I'm falling short.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: Anger, actually. I'm angry that I let my boss have so much power over how I see myself. I'm angry that I'm still letting these experiences affect me so much. But there's also this... sadness. Like, why couldn't I have had a supportive boss or a supportive dad? Why did I have to deal with people who just tore me down?",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging those emotions feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly freeing? Like, I've been trying so hard to just move on and be \"over it,\" but actually letting myself feel angry and sad... it's like releasing a pressure valve. I feel less tense, somehow. But also vulnerable. It's scary to let these feelings out.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remind myself that I'm not in that situation anymore. That I'm safe now, and that guy doesn't have any power over me. And maybe... maybe I need to be a bit kinder to myself? It's not my fault that I had these experiences. I did the best I could with what I knew at the time.",
    "Therapist: How can you show yourself that kindness?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I could talk to myself the way I'd talk to a friend who went through something similar? Like, \"Hey, you didn't deserve that treatment. You're capable and valuable, regardless of what that jerk said.\" It feels a bit cheesy, but... maybe it could help?",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit calmer. My breathing's evened out. I still feel a little shaky, but not as intensely as before. And I'm realizing... I got through that memory. It was tough, but I did it. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, actually. Like, maybe I can handle more than I thought. Don't get me wrong, I'm not suddenly all confident and healed or anything. But there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope maybe? That I can work through this, that I'm not doomed to always feel this way.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to feel these emotions. That feeling them doesn't make them permanent. And maybe... maybe I can start challenging some of those negative thoughts when they come up. Not beating myself up for having them, but gently questioning them. Is that... is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about ending here today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. I feel... wrung out, but in a good way? Like after a really intense workout. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did great work today. Take care of yourself this week."
