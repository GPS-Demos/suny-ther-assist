    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My hands are already sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day of the car accident. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm driving down the highway. It's early evening, and the sun is setting. The sky is this deep orange color. I remember thinking how beautiful it was, just before... before everything went wrong.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a loud screech. My heart starts racing. In my rearview mirror, I see this truck swerving. It's... it's coming right at me. Oh god, it's happening so fast.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Rahul. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 7. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. The truck... it slams into the back of my car. The impact is deafening. My body jerks forward, then snaps back. I... I can smell burning rubber and something metallic. Is that... is that blood?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Everything's spinning. The world is upside down. I realize my car has flipped. I'm hanging from my seatbelt. There's glass everywhere. My arm... oh god, my arm is pinned. I can't move it. The pain is... it's excruciating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I can't breathe. I think I'm going to die here. I keep thinking about my girlfriend, my family. Will I ever see them again? The pain... it's overwhelming. I want to scream but I can't.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: *nods, breathing heavily* I hear sirens in the distance. They sound so far away. I'm trying to stay conscious, but it's getting harder. The smell of gasoline is making me nauseous. I'm afraid the car might explode.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear voices. Someone's shouting. \"We've got a live one here!\" I feel a surge of hope, but I'm still so scared. They're trying to get me out, but every movement sends shockwaves of pain through my body.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart's pounding. It feels so real, like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Feel your feet on the ground. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens as they're trying to get you out?",
    "Client: They're using some kind of tool. The sound of metal grinding on metal is piercing. I feel the car shift, and a new wave of pain hits me. I'm crying, begging them to hurry. I can hear one of the rescuers talking to me, trying to keep me calm, but their words are fuzzy.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this point?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my time in combat. How I survived that, only to maybe die here on some highway. It seems so unfair. I'm angry, scared, and... and just so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still around 8 or 9. It's not getting easier.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They finally get me out. The sudden movement makes me scream. I'm on a stretcher now, being rushed to an ambulance. The lights are so bright, they hurt my eyes. I can see other cars stopped, people staring. I feel exposed, vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you experiencing in your body?",
    "Client: Everything hurts. My arm is throbbing. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm cold, so cold. I'm shivering uncontrollably. The paramedics are cutting away my clothes, and I feel so... so violated, even though I know they're trying to help.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: It's chaos. They're hooking me up to machines, inserting IVs. The sirens are wailing. Every bump in the road sends a jolt of pain through me. I keep fading in and out of consciousness. I hear them saying something about internal bleeding, and I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Rahul?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. My heart's racing. It feels like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *follows breathing instructions* Okay... I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you remember next?",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. It's a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. They're rushing me somewhere. Operating room, I think. I'm scared, but also relieved to be there. A doctor leans over me, tells me they're going to take good care of me. I want to believe her, but I'm so afraid.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my girlfriend. Will she know what happened? Will she be worried? And then... then I start thinking about my time in the army. How I survived all that, only to end up here. It feels like some cruel joke.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also like releasing some pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing really well. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: They're prepping me for surgery. I can hear the machines beeping. Someone's counting backwards... 10, 9, 8... And then everything goes black. The next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. Everything's hazy, dulled by pain meds. But I'm alive. I made it.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to remember that moment of realization?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Relief, gratitude, but also this overwhelming sadness. Like, why did this happen to me? Haven't I been through enough?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, Rahul. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I faced this memory and didn't completely fall apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel that way, but... maybe you're right.",
    "Therapist: As we wrap up, what's your current SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. How do you feel about what we've accomplished today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I think it helped. Talking through it, facing those memories... it's like they have a little less power over me now.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You've done excellent work today, Rahul.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue to work through this together. For now, let's do a quick grounding exercise before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath and tell me five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: I see... the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the plant in the corner, my shoes, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my watch, and the carpet under my feet.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The scent of the air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Rahul. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. Grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Remember to use these techniques when you need them. We'll pick up here next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. Take care, Rahul. I'll see you next week."
