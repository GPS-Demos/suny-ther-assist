    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking home from class. It's getting dark, and the streets are quieter than usual. Suddenly, I hear footsteps behind me. My heart starts racing. I turn around, and there's a man with a knife. He grabs me and pulls me into an alley. I can't breathe. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I can feel my heart pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue.",
    "Client: He pushes me against the wall. The knife is at my throat. I can feel the cold metal. He's yelling at me, demanding money, my phone. I'm shaking. I can't speak. I'm thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\"",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to whisper that I'll give him everything. My hands are trembling as I reach for my bag. I'm trying to move slowly, afraid any sudden movement will make him hurt me. I can smell his breath - it reeks of alcohol. I'm silently praying someone will walk by, but the alley is so dark and secluded.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My throat feels tight, like I can't swallow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As I'm handing over my things, we hear sirens in the distance. He panics. For a moment, I think he might... he might kill me to keep me quiet. But instead, he shoves me to the ground and runs. I'm left there, gasping for air, my cheek scraping against the rough pavement. I can't move. I'm so relieved but also terrified he might come back.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's dropped to a 6. I feel shaky, but talking about him leaving helps a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. Reliving it is draining, but... I don't know, maybe a little less scary than before?",
    "Therapist: That's common. Let's take a break. You did great."
