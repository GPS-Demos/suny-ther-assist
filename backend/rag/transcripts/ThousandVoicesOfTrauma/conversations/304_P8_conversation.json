    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is spinning. The memory of my brother's funeral... it's so vivid now. I can still smell the incense, hear the prayers. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: There's this tightness in my chest. I feel... guilty, I think. I keep replaying our last conversation, wishing I'd said something different. And then there's this anger, you know? At the world, at the doctors, at myself. It's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my gut. I'm angry that he was taken so young, that the treatments didn't work. But mostly, I'm furious at how some people reacted. There were these comments, you know? About how \"all lives matter\" when I talked about how this loss affected our community. It felt like they were diminishing our pain, our cultural experience of grief.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. How did those comments impact you?",
    "Client: They made me feel... invisible, I guess. Like our pain wasn't valid because we're South Asian. It's not just about losing my brother anymore. It's about feeling like an outsider in my own country, even in my grief. And that... that hurts in a different way.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... am I overreacting? Should I just \"get over it\" like some people have suggested? But then I remember how my brother always stood up for our community, and I feel like I'm letting him down if I don't speak up. It's confusing, you know? I want to honor him, but I'm also tired of fighting.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, like I'm carrying a heavy weight. And my throat... it feels tight, like I'm holding back tears. But there's also this warmth in my chest when I think about my brother's strength. It's... it's complicated.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel heard. To know that it's okay to grieve in my own way, and that my experiences are valid. I need to find a way to honor my brother without constantly feeling like I'm at war with the world.",
    "Therapist: That's important. How might you start to do that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by sharing more about him? Not just the loss, but who he was, our culture, our family stories. I could write about it, or maybe even organize a community event. Something that celebrates his life and our heritage.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful way to honor him. How does thinking about that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's sadness, of course, but also a spark of excitement. Like I'm carrying his spirit forward. And it feels... empowering, I guess? Like I'm reclaiming our narrative.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're finding that spark. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that it's okay to feel multiple things at once. Grief, anger, love, hope... they can all coexist. And maybe... maybe that's what healing looks like for me. Not getting rid of the pain, but learning to carry it alongside joy and purpose.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... freeing, in a way. Like I'm giving myself permission to be human, to be complex. And it makes me think about how my brother would react. He'd probably smile and say, \"About time you figured that out, bro.\" That thought... it makes me smile too.",
    "Therapist: It's wonderful to see that smile. What do you want to take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to grieve and heal in my own way. That my experiences, including the racial aspects, are valid. And that honoring my brother doesn't mean I have to be perfect or have it all figured out. It's a journey, and I'm... I'm doing the best I can.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful takeaway. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess. Still sad, still angry at times, but also more... grounded? Like I have a direction now, even if the path isn't clear. And I feel... seen. Thank you for that.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Is there anything else you'd like to explore before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I feel like I have a lot to process, but in a good way. Like I'm finally starting to make sense of all these tangled emotions. It's exhausting, but also... hopeful? Yeah, I think that's the word. Hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Let's end here for today. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you continue to process.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. This... this helped more than I expected. I'm looking forward to our next session."
