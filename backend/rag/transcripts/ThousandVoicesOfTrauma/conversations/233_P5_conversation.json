    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about the accident, and it's been affecting my sleep.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it involves. To be honest, it sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the trauma. The idea of purposely thinking about the accident and losing Sarah... it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to avoid those memories. What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you typically cope with difficult memories?",
    "Client: I usually try to distract myself. I'll throw myself into work or tinker with my car. Sometimes I have a drink or two to numb the pain. But lately, nothing seems to help much.",
    "Therapist: I see. Imaginal exposure can help process these memories. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into here.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the trauma memory in a safe environment. It may be uncomfortable initially, but it helps reduce symptoms over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. But how will this be different from the flashbacks I already experience? Those are awful enough.",
    "Therapist: Unlike flashbacks, you'll be in control. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... that's somewhat reassuring. How long will this process take? And what exactly will I need to do?",
    "Therapist: We'll do multiple sessions. You'll recount the event in present tense, focusing on sensory details and emotions.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. I'm not sure I can do this. What if I break down or can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. We can pause anytime. Your safety and comfort are paramount.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate that. I guess I'm just scared of facing it all again. It's been easier to keep busy and avoid thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is understandable. This takes courage. How are you feeling about trying this?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but I want to get better. For myself and for my family. They've been so patient with me. If this can help, I'm willing to give it a shot.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Remember, this is to help you heal. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Just one - will this help with the guilt I feel? I keep thinking I could have done something to prevent Sarah's death.",
    "Therapist: Addressing those feelings is part of the process. We'll work through that together.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I'm still scared, but I'm ready to try. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Shall we begin?"
