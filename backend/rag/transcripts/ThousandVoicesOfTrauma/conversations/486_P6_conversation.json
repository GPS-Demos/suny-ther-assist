    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that room. It's dark, and I can smell the musty air. The blindfold is tight around my eyes, and my wrists are bound behind my back. I can hear muffled voices outside the door, speaking in a language I don't understand. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I'm definitely feeling anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: The door creaks open, and I hear footsteps approaching. Someone roughly grabs my arm and pulls me to my feet. I stumble, feeling disoriented. They're dragging me somewhere, and I can't see where I'm going. I'm terrified of what might happen next...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: They push me into a chair and rip off the blindfold. The bright light hurts my eyes, and I blink rapidly, trying to adjust. There are three men in the room, all wearing masks. One of them starts shouting questions at me, but I can barely understand what he's saying. I'm shaking uncontrollably...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is so tight...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) The man keeps yelling, getting angrier. He slams his fist on the table, and I flinch. I'm trying to answer his questions, but I don't know what he wants. I'm so afraid they're going to hurt me... or worse. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again...",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard it hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Hours pass, or maybe it's days. I've lost track of time. They keep me in that room, occasionally bringing me water or stale bread. The questioning continues, sometimes gentle, sometimes aggressive. I'm exhausted and disoriented. At one point, I hear gunfire outside, and I think this might be the end...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... actually dropped to a 7. I'm still anxious, but talking about it is making it feel less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a commotion outside. I hear shouting and more gunfire. The door bursts open, and I see men in uniform. For a moment, I think it's my captors, but then I realize... they're here to rescue me. The relief is so intense, I start sobbing uncontrollably...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... better than I expected. It was intense reliving it, but I feel like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. We'll end here for today. Well done."
