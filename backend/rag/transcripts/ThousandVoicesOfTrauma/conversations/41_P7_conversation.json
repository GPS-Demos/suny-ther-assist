    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the hospital for a routine check-up. Everything seemed normal at first. I was sitting in the waiting room when suddenly there was a commotion. A man burst in, waving a gun. He was shouting that he wanted to see a specific doctor. Everyone froze. I could feel my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The man looked desperate and angry. He started threatening the receptionist, demanding to know where the doctor was. I remember feeling so helpless, trapped in my chair. The fear was overwhelming. I couldn't stop shaking...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can still hear the screams of other patients. Some were crying quietly. A child started wailing, and the gunman yelled at them to shut up. I wanted to do something, to help somehow, but I was paralyzed with fear. My mouth was dry, and I could taste bile rising in my throat.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: Security guards arrived, but that only seemed to agitate the gunman more. He grabbed a nurse and held her at gunpoint. I remember thinking, \"This is it. We're all going to die here.\" The nurse was sobbing, begging him to let her go. I felt so guilty for not being able to help her...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Time seemed to stretch on forever. I kept thinking about my late husband, wishing he was there with me. The air felt thick and suffocating. I was struggling to breathe normally. Every time the gunman moved or shouted, I flinched. I felt so vulnerable, so exposed...",
    "Therapist: You're describing it vividly. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling anxious. My hands are getting clammy, just like they were that day. I can feel my heart rate increasing. It's like I'm back there again...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here with me.",
    "Client: Right... thank you. The standoff continued for what felt like hours. Police negotiators arrived. I remember the tense back-and-forth between them and the gunman. At one point, he fired a shot into the ceiling. The sound was deafening. I thought I was going to pass out from fear...",
    "Therapist: You're doing exceptionally well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, they managed to talk him down. When he finally surrendered, I felt a rush of relief so intense it was almost painful. But even after it was over, I couldn't stop shaking. The fear lingered. For weeks after, I had nightmares about it. I was afraid to go back to any hospital or medical facility...",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is still hard, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before. I'm realizing that I survived something truly terrifying, and maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You are indeed strong.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment to collect myself. This experience... it changed me. I became so anxious about medical appointments after that. I know it's irrational, but I can't help feeling tense every time I enter a hospital now. It's like I'm constantly on alert, waiting for something bad to happen...",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I want to get better, to not let this control my life anymore. But it's hard. Sometimes I feel so angry - at the gunman, at the situation, even at myself for being so affected by it. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anger is a common response to trauma.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to know. I've been holding onto so much. This fear, this anger... it's exhausting. But talking about it like this, really facing it head-on... it's difficult, but I think it's helping. I want to be able to go to my check-ups without panicking. I want to feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Shall we take a short break?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need a moment to breathe. This is intense, but... I'm glad I'm doing it. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy to hear these things either.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's pause here and resume when you're ready."
