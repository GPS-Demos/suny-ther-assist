    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes now. I can see the living room of our old house. The faded wallpaper, the worn-out couch... I'm hiding behind it, peeking out. I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. Their voices are getting louder, and I'm starting to feel scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The argument is escalating. I can hear dishes being slammed on the counter. My father's voice is booming, and my mother is crying. I want to cover my ears, but I'm frozen. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6 or 7. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. I hear my mother scream. I'm terrified, but I force myself to look. My father has knocked over the kitchen table. Everything's on the floor - broken plates, food everywhere. My mother is backed into a corner, and my father is advancing towards her with his fist raised. I want to run, to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can smell the spilled food, hear the shards of plate crunching under my father's feet. My mother's crying, begging him to stop. I'm watching it all happen, and I feel so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I... I can't watch anymore. I run to my room and hide under the bed. I can still hear the shouting, things breaking. I'm crying silently, praying for it to stop. I feel so alone, so scared. Why can't someone help us?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm still shaky, but being under the bed feels safer.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: The noises are getting quieter now. I can hear my father stomping out of the house, slamming the door. There's silence for a while, then I hear my mother's soft sobs. I want to go to her, but I'm too afraid to move.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 or 6. I'm feeling sad now, more than scared. My heart isn't racing as much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How about we start winding down?",
    "Client: Okay. I'm slowly coming out from under the bed. The house is quiet now, except for my mother's muffled crying. I feel drained, exhausted. But also... relieved that it's over, at least for now.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's about a 4 now. I feel... I don't know, kind of numb, but also a bit proud that I got through this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You did incredibly well today."
