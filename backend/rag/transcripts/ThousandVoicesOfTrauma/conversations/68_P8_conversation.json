    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs, and that overwhelming feeling of panic just washes over me. It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that this happened to me, that someone violated my home, my safe space. I keep thinking about how vulnerable I felt in that moment, cowering in my bedroom, not knowing what was going to happen next. It's like I'm reliving that helplessness all over again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that helplessness manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're practically up to my ears. And there's this knot in my stomach, like I've swallowed a rock. I notice I'm breathing really shallowly too, almost like I'm trying not to make any noise. It's... it's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did this have to happen to me?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know others have been through worse. But I can't shake this feeling that I should have done something differently. Maybe if I had better locks, or if I hadn't gone to bed so early that night... It's irrational, I know, but the thoughts just keep spinning.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts compare to your everyday thoughts about the incident?",
    "Client: They're... more intense, I suppose. In day-to-day life, I can usually push these thoughts aside, but right now, they're front and center. It's like all the little details I've tried to forget are suddenly crystal clear. The creaking of the stairs as they came up, the smell of my own fear... it's all there.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to sit with these sensations and memories?",
    "Client: It's uncomfortable, to say the least. Part of me wants to run away, to think about anything else. But there's also this... I don't know, almost a relief? Like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of trying to pretend it didn't happen. It's scary, but also... maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: Mm. Can you tell me more about that feeling of relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've been carrying this weight around, you know? Always looking over my shoulder, always on edge. But talking about it, really diving into the memory, it's like I'm finally acknowledging how much it affected me. It's painful, yes, but also... freeing, in a way? Like I'm giving myself permission to feel all of this instead of bottling it up.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to your broader journey of recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's showing me that I'm stronger than I thought. For months after the break-in, I could barely sleep, always imagining every little noise was another intruder. But now, even though revisiting the memory is difficult, I can see that I survived. I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm working through it. It's like... like I'm reclaiming my story, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that the initial panic is starting to subside a little. My breathing is getting deeper, and that knot in my stomach is loosening. It's almost like... like the memory is losing some of its power over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still upsetting, but it feels more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight is lifting. My shoulders are dropping a bit, and I can feel the tension in my jaw releasing. There's still a tremor in my hands, but it's not as pronounced. And you know what? I just realized I've unclenched my fists. I didn't even know I was doing that.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I'm not as helpless as I felt that night. I mean, here I am, facing this memory head-on. That takes courage, doesn't it? And I'm also thinking about how far I've come. A few months ago, I couldn't even talk about the break-in without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still difficult, but I'm doing it. That's... that's progress, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does recognizing that progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... proud, I suppose. And hopeful. Like maybe one day, this won't have such a hold on me. I'm also feeling grateful for this process, as uncomfortable as it is. It's like... like I'm slowly taking back control of my life, my thoughts, my feelings. It's empowering, in a way I didn't expect.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What do you want to remember from this experience?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I can face this. That even though it's painful and scary, I can sit with these memories and come out the other side. I want to remember that I'm not that terrified person hiding in my bedroom anymore - I'm someone who's actively working to heal. And I want to remember this feeling of... I don't know, maybe empowerment? The idea that I'm not just a victim, but a survivor.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful takeaways. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, honestly. But also lighter, if that makes sense? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. There's still fear there, and sadness, but also a glimmer of hope. And determination, I think. Determination to keep working through this, to keep facing these memories until they don't have such a strong hold on me anymore.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll end here for today."
