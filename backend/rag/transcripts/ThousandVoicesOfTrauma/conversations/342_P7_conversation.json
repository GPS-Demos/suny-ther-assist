    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the animal attack incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was hiking in the woods near our cabin. It was a beautiful fall day, crisp air, leaves crunching under my feet. I remember feeling so peaceful. Then... I heard a growl. Before I could even turn around, I felt this massive weight slam into my back. I fell forward, face-first into the ground. The pain was... it was excruciating. I could feel claws digging into my back, and hot breath on my neck. I was certain I was going to die right there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't breathe. The weight was crushing me. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. I could smell the bear's fur, this musky, wild scent. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. I managed to turn my head slightly, and I saw its massive paw next to my face. The claws were huge, covered in dirt and... and my blood. I felt so helpless, so small. I've never been so terrified in my life.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I... I don't know if I can. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The bear started to bite my shoulder. The pain was... indescribable. I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die here, alone in the woods.\" I could feel my blood soaking through my clothes, warm against my skin. I tried to play dead, hoping it would lose interest. Every second felt like an eternity. I was so aware of every sound - the bear's heavy breathing, the rustling of leaves, my own heartbeat thundering in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud noise - I think it was a gunshot. The bear's weight lifted off me, and I heard it crashing through the underbrush. I was afraid to move, terrified it would come back. I lay there, face down in the dirt, for what felt like hours. My whole body was shaking uncontrollably. I could taste blood in my mouth, and the pain... it was everywhere. I wanted to call for help, but I was too scared to make a sound.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I... I can't... It's too much. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... I... I heard voices calling out. It was the park rangers. When they found me, I broke down sobbing. I was so relieved, but also still terrified. They kept telling me I was going to be okay, but I didn't believe them. The pain was overwhelming, and I was sure I was going to die. As they carried me out on a stretcher, I remember looking up at the trees, watching the sunlight filter through the leaves. I thought it might be the last time I'd ever see something so beautiful.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's like a weight has been lifted, talking about it like this. I've never described it in such detail before. It's still terrifying, but... maybe a little less so?",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could do it, but... I did. I actually did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but... I'm glad we did this. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session. Take care."
