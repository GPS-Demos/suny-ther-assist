    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Ramirez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? The screeching tires, the impact... I can still hear the crunch of metal. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I couldn't do anything to stop it. One minute I'm driving home, thinking about what to make for dinner, and the next... chaos. It's like my life changed in a split second. I keep thinking, what if I had left work five minutes later? Or taken a different route? Maybe none of this would have happened.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge. Especially when driving. I'm constantly scanning for potential threats, you know? It's exhausting. And it's not just on the road. I feel like I have to be prepared for anything, anytime. It's affecting my work, my relationships... I'm not the carefree guy I used to be.",
    "Therapist: What emotions came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of anger too. I'm angry at the other driver, angry at myself for not being able to avoid it. And there's this deep sadness... like mourning for the person I used to be before the accident. It's like I lost a part of myself that day, and I don't know if I'll ever get it back.",
    "Therapist: How does processing these emotions feel different from avoiding them?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. It hurts, but it's also freeing in a way. I've spent so much energy trying to push these feelings away, and now that I'm facing them, it's like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you learned about yourself today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Going through that memory again was terrifying, but I did it. And I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe I'm not as broken as I thought I was. There's a part of me that survived that crash, and that part is still in here somewhere.",
    "Therapist: How might this realization impact your recovery?",
    "Client: It gives me hope, I suppose. If I can face this memory head-on, maybe I can start facing other things too. Maybe I can start reclaiming parts of my life that I've been avoiding. It's scary, but... I want to try. I want to feel like myself again, even if it's a different version of me.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding driving on the highway where the accident happened. Maybe... maybe I could try driving a small stretch of it. Not the whole way, just... just to prove to myself that I can. With my wife in the car for support, of course.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Terrified, honestly. But also... determined? It's like there's a fire in me now. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to take back control, even if it's just a little bit at a time.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I think... I need to talk to my wife about it. She's been so patient with me through all of this. And maybe... maybe I could use some relaxation techniques before we try? Like the breathing exercises we've practiced. Just to help keep me grounded.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a thoughtful plan. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... knowing that I have these sessions, that I have a safe place to process all of this... it means a lot. Could we maybe spend some time next session preparing for that drive? I think having a solid plan would help me feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This is hard work, but... I think I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It's dim, but it's there. And that gives me hope."
