    "Therapist: Hello. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I'm... well, I suppose I'm a bit nervous. I've been thinking about this session all week. You mentioned we'd be doing something called imaginal exposure? It sounds a bit intimidating, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about that awful car accident. The idea of purposely bringing it all back up... it's frightening. What if I can't handle it? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. And with my depression... I worry it might make everything worse.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss how we'll approach this together.",
    "Client: Okay, I appreciate that. It's just... ever since I moved into assisted living after losing my partner, I've felt so vulnerable. And now, dredging up these old traumas... it's a lot to process. But I trust you, Dr. Thompson. Can you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the memory gradually, with my support throughout.",
    "Client: That sounds a little less daunting. But what exactly will happen? Will I have to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions? I'm sorry for all these questions, it's just... well, after years of being bullied for not fitting into traditional gender norms, I get anxious when I don't know what to expect.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the memory aloud. I'll guide you, and we can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Oh, I see. That doesn't sound too bad. But what if I get overwhelmed? Sometimes my emotions get the better of me, especially since I've been dealing with depression. I don't want to lose control.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control, and can stop anytime.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Thompson. I know at my age, I should be better at handling these things, but sometimes I feel like that scared young person again, facing all those bullies. But I want to get better. I want to be able to think about that car accident without feeling like my world is ending.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can significantly reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Really? That would be wonderful. I've been struggling with nightmares and flashbacks for so long. It's affected every aspect of my life. If this could help... well, I'm willing to try. But I have to ask, is it normal to feel this apprehensive?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your feelings are normal and expected.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear that I'm not overreacting. You know, despite my nerves, I'm actually starting to feel a bit hopeful. Maybe this imaginal exposure could be the key to finally processing what happened. I've carried this burden for so long... the idea of potentially letting some of it go is... well, it's quite powerful.",
    "Therapist: Your hope is encouraging. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy, but I trust you, Dr. Thompson. And I'm grateful for your support through this process. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's start slowly..."
