    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the bank. It's a normal day, busy but not too crowded. I'm at the counter, filling out a deposit slip. Suddenly, there's shouting. I turn around and see two men with masks, waving guns. My heart starts racing. They're yelling at everyone to get down on the floor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I drop to the ground, my hands shaking. The marble floor is cold against my cheek. I can hear people whimpering, a child starts to cry. One of the men is at the counter, demanding money. The other is pacing, keeping watch. His boots are so close to my face. I'm terrified he's going to step on me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My mind is racing. I keep thinking about the sexual abuse from my childhood. The feeling of helplessness is so similar. I feel small, powerless. I can't breathe properly. The man with the gun near me, he... he reminds me of my abuser. The way he moves, the smell of his sweat. It's like I'm reliving both traumas at once.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm trying to stay still, but I'm trembling. I can hear the tellers emptying the cash drawers. The sounds are so vivid - the rustle of money, the beeping of alarms. Someone's cell phone rings, and one of the robbers shouts, kicking it across the floor. I flinch at the sound, and he turns towards me. I'm sure he's going to shoot me. I close my eyes tight, waiting for the bullet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: But nothing happens. He moves away. I open my eyes, and I can see a pool of urine spreading from the person next to me. The shame and fear in the air are palpable. It feels like hours, but I know it's only been minutes. Suddenly, there's a commotion. Police sirens outside. The robbers are panicking. One of them grabs a woman, uses her as a shield. She's sobbing, begging. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The negotiation starts. It's a blur of shouting, demands, threats. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The woman being held is hyperventilating. I can't stop staring at her, feeling guilty for not helping. Hours pass. We're all exhausted, dehydrated. Some people are getting sick. The smell is awful. Finally, there's a loud bang - a flash grenade. Everything happens so fast. Police storm in, there's shouting, gunfire. I curl into a ball, certain I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: When I finally look up, it's over. The robbers are subdued. We're being led out by officers. The sunlight hurts my eyes. There are ambulances, news vans. I give a statement, but I can barely remember what I say. I go home, but I can't sleep for days. Every noise makes me jump. I keep replaying it in my mind, mixed with memories of my childhood abuse. I feel like I'll never be safe again.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a little relieved. It's hard to talk about, but it feels good to get it out.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today."
