    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt, like maybe I could have done something to stop it. I know logically that's not true, but emotionally... it's just there.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that fear and guilt in your body?",
    "Client: The fear is like this tight knot in my stomach. It's making me feel a bit nauseous. The guilt... it's more in my chest. It's heavy, like there's a weight pressing down on me. My shoulders feel tense too, like I'm bracing for something.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do more?\" Even though I was just a kid, I feel like I should have protected my mom somehow. And then I think about how unfair it all was. We didn't deserve that. No one does. It makes me angry, but then I feel guilty for being angry. It's this confusing mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: They're... they're actually less intense now. Before, I'd be completely overwhelmed, probably having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but I can... I can sit with it more, if that makes sense? It's like I can observe the feelings without being completely consumed by them.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. And I'm learning that these feelings, as uncomfortable as they are, they can't actually harm me. They're just... they're just feelings. They come and go. It's still hard, but I feel like I'm gaining some control back.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, actually. For so long, I felt helpless, like I was at the mercy of these memories and emotions. But now, even though it's still difficult, I feel like I have some agency. Like I'm not just a victim anymore, but someone who's actively working on healing.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to focus on moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on self-compassion. I'm still really hard on myself, you know? I beat myself up for not being \"over it\" already, or for having bad days. I want to learn how to be kinder to myself, to treat myself with the same compassion I'd show a friend going through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How might you start practicing that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could start by acknowledging my progress more? Like, instead of focusing on how far I have to go, I could remind myself how far I've come. And when I have those guilty thoughts, I could try to counter them with more compassionate ones. It's not easy, but I think it could help.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to do that?",
    "Client: I think... I could use some guidance on specific self-compassion techniques. And maybe... maybe some reassurance that it's okay to struggle sometimes? I still feel like I should be \"stronger\" or \"better\" by now, even though I know healing isn't linear.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. I feel a bit drained from reliving the memory, but also... hopeful? Like, yes, this is hard work, but I can see a path forward. And talking about it, really diving into these feelings... it's tough, but it also feels like I'm taking control, you know? Like I'm facing this head-on instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve more into self-compassion techniques. And maybe... maybe we could explore how my experiences have shaped my current relationships? I've noticed some patterns that I think might be related to what happened, and I'd like to understand that better.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way? Like I've done some important work. My body feels a bit more relaxed now, the knot in my stomach has loosened a bit. I'm feeling... I don't know, maybe a bit proud of myself for getting through this? It's not easy, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll pick up here next time."
