    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that room. It's dark, and I can hear muffled voices outside. My heart is racing, and I feel so trapped. I keep thinking about what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6. I'm definitely anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The door opens, and I see him enter. My stomach drops, and I feel sick. He's talking, but I can barely hear him over the sound of my own heartbeat. I'm frozen in place, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting worse. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweaty, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's coming closer, and I can smell his cologne. It makes me want to gag. I'm pressing myself against the wall, trying to disappear. My mind is racing, thinking of ways to escape, but I know there's no way out.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I'll try. He's touching me now, and I feel so powerless. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. It's like I'm watching it happen to someone else, but I can feel everything.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can hear him breathing, feel his hands... I'm shaking uncontrollably. I want it to stop.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a little. Maybe an 8? I'm starting to remember where I am.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm still shaking, but I can feel the chair I'm sitting in now. My heart is still racing, but I'm able to take deeper breaths. The memory is still there, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I think I'm down to a 7. I feel drained, but also a little relieved that it's over.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I got through it. I didn't think I could face those memories, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
