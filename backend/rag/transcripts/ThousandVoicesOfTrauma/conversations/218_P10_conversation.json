    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly, doc, I'm a bit on edge. This whole thing about revisiting my time in the cult... it's not easy, you know? My hands are already getting clammy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's... let's do this. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start with the day you first considered leaving. Describe it in present tense.",
    "Client: Okay, um... I'm sitting in my small room at the compound. It's early morning, maybe 5 AM. The air is... it's heavy, you know? Like it's pressing down on me. I can hear some of the others starting to stir for morning meditation, but I... I just can't bring myself to get up.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart's racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I know that if I don't show up for meditation, there'll be consequences. But I also know that if I do go, I'll be lying to myself and everyone else. I... I can't do it anymore.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe an 80?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right, okay... So, I'm sitting on my bed, and I can hear footsteps in the hallway. My palms are sweating, and I'm trying to decide what to do. Part of me wants to just go along with it, like I have for the past two years. But there's this voice in my head, getting louder and louder, telling me that I can't keep living this lie.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start packing a bag. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely zip it up. I keep looking over my shoulder, terrified someone's going to walk in. I grab a few clothes, a picture of my family that I've kept hidden... God, my family. I haven't spoken to them in so long.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking about your family?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed with guilt. I see my mom's face in that picture, and I remember the last time I saw her. She was crying, begging me not to go. I told her she just didn't understand, that the cult was my new family. But now... now I realize how much I've hurt her, how much I've lost.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 90?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I've got my bag packed, and I'm standing at the door. My hand is on the knob, but I can't seem to turn it. I'm paralyzed with fear. What if they catch me? What if I can't make it on my own? I've been here for two years, and they've convinced me that the outside world is dangerous, that I need them to survive.",
    "Therapist: What gives you the strength to turn that knob?",
    "Client: I... I think about my little sister. She'd be graduating high school now. I promised her I'd be there, before all this happened. That promise... it's like a lifeline. I take a deep breath, and I turn the knob.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see when you open the door?",
    "Client: The hallway is empty, thank God. But it feels endless, like it stretches on forever. Each step I take feels like I'm walking through quicksand. My heart is pounding so loud I'm sure someone's going to hear it. I make it to the stairs, and I'm about to go down when I hear voices coming from below.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking all over. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I might throw up. I press myself against the wall, trying to become invisible. The voices are getting closer, and I recognize one of them as the leader's.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm panicking. I'm thinking about all the times I've seen people punished for trying to leave. The isolation, the \"re-education\" sessions. Part of me wants to run back to my room, to pretend this never happened. But I can't... I can't go back.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, where's your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still on the stairs. The voices are right below me now. I'm holding my breath, praying they don't come up. And then... they start to fade. They're moving away. I wait for what feels like hours, but it's probably only a few minutes. When I'm sure they're gone, I practically run down the stairs.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when you reach the bottom?",
    "Client: I... I see the front door. It's right there, but it feels miles away. I take a step towards it, and then another. Each step gets easier. I reach out, grab the handle, and... I'm outside. The sun is just starting to rise, and the air... it's so fresh. I feel like I can breathe for the first time in years.",
    "Therapist: How does that moment feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I'm terrified, but there's also this sense of... of freedom. Like a weight has been lifted off my chest. I start walking, then running. I don't know where I'm going, but I know I can't stay here.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go?",
    "Client: I... I head towards town. It's about five miles away, and I'm exhausted by the time I get there. My feet are blistered, and I'm paranoid that everyone is staring at me. I find a payphone and... and I call my mom.",
    "Therapist: What's that conversation like?",
    "Client: It's... God, it's so hard. When she answers, I can barely speak. I'm crying, trying to apologize, to explain. She's crying too, but she keeps saying she loves me, that she'll come get me. I give her the address of the gas station I'm at, and then I just... I wait.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, both in that moment and here in the present?",
    "Client: In that moment, I'm a mess of emotions. Relief, fear, guilt, hope... all mixed together. And now, sitting here... it's still hard to talk about, but I feel... I feel proud. Proud that I had the courage to leave, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe a 60? It's still there, but it's not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Carlos. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think... I think that's good. It's a lot to process, but I feel like I've faced a big part of it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we wrap up.",
    "Client: Okay, yeah. That sounds good. Thank you, doc. This... this isn't easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. We'll continue working through this together."
