    "Therapist: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Oh, Dr. Thompson... I'm... I'm not sure. I've been tossing and turning all night, thinking about this. Part of me wants to get it over with, but another part... well, it's just so hard to go back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose we should. (Deep breath) Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night of the home invasion. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in bed. It's dark, maybe around 2 AM. John is snoring softly next to me. The house is quiet, but something feels... off. There's this faint scratching sound coming from downstairs. At first, I think it might be our old cat, Whiskers, but then I remember... Whiskers passed away last month.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The scratching gets louder. My heart starts racing. I nudge John, but he's such a heavy sleeper. I'm frozen, listening. Then I hear it - the unmistakable sound of our back door creaking open. Oh God, someone's in the house!",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) I... I shake John harder, whispering urgently, \"Wake up! Someone's in the house!\" He stirs, confused. I can hear footsteps downstairs now, moving around our living room. John reaches for his phone to call 911, but it's not on his nightstand. We realize it's charging downstairs.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I'm trembling, and I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: John gets up, telling me to stay put. But I can't let him go alone. We creep to our bedroom door, and that's when we hear it - multiple voices. There's more than one intruder. John looks at me, and I can see the fear in his eyes too.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (Breathing slowly) Okay... okay. We... we decide to barricade ourselves in the bedroom. John pushes our heavy dresser against the door while I frantically search for something, anything we can use to defend ourselves. The voices are getting louder, coming up the stairs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I find an old baseball bat in our closet. John takes it, standing ready by the door. We're both shaking. I can hear them trying doorknobs in the hallway. They're getting closer. I'm praying they'll just take what they want and leave, but deep down, I know... I know they know we're here.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this memory?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I can't breathe. Like the walls are closing in on us. I'm so scared, Dr. Thompson. So scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) They're... they're at our door now. I can see the doorknob jiggling. John's grip tightens on the bat. I'm frozen, watching. Then... then there's this loud crash. They're trying to break down the door!",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can feel my heart racing even now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: The door is splintering. John yells at them to go away, that we've called the police. But they keep coming. The dresser is starting to move. I... I grab my phone, ready to call 911 the moment they break through. And then... and then...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The door gives way. Two men burst in. One has a gun. John swings the bat, but the other guy tackles him. I'm screaming, dialing 911. The man with the gun turns to me, and I... I think this is it. This is how I die.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: I... I know. But in that moment, I was sure it was over. The man grabs my phone, throws it against the wall. He's yelling at us, asking where we keep our valuables. John's still struggling with the other intruder. I can't... I can't think straight.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there are sirens. Our neighbor must have heard the commotion and called the police. The men panic. They start grabbing whatever they can - my jewelry box, John's watch. And then... they're gone. Just like that. We hear them thundering down the stairs, out the back door.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Relief... overwhelming relief. But also shock. I can't stop shaking. John hugs me, and we're both just... sobbing. The police arrive minutes later, but it feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. My heart's still racing, but I feel... I feel a bit lighter, having talked through it.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it without completely falling apart this time.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. It's still hard, but... but I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Shall we take a break?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could use a moment to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today."
