    "Therapist: Welcome, Aisha. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like there's a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my childhood home. It's dark, and I can hear yelling from downstairs. My heart is racing. I'm about 8 years old, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm creeping down the stairs. The shouting is getting louder. It's my parents. They're fighting again, but this time it sounds worse. I can hear things breaking.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm at the bottom of the stairs now. I can see into the living room. My dad... he's got my mom by the arm. She's crying, begging him to stop. I want to help her, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel sick to my stomach. I... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath with me. In... and out. Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... My dad sees me. He lets go of Mom and starts yelling at me to go back to bed. But I can't move. I'm so scared. Mom's sobbing on the floor.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Aisha. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad's coming towards me. He looks so angry. I've never seen him like this before. I want to run, but my legs won't work. He grabs my arm, and it hurts.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right, right... Okay. He's dragging me up the stairs. I'm crying, begging him to stop. Mom's calling out, telling him to leave me alone. But he won't listen.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I feel so small and weak.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're doing well facing them. What's happening now?",
    "Client: He throws me into my room. I fall onto the floor. He's yelling... telling me to never come downstairs when they're fighting. That it's none of my business. I'm sobbing, can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm curled up on the floor. I can hear Mom crying downstairs. Dad's stomping around, still yelling. I'm shaking all over. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. You're safe here. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing really well. Can you tell me what you're thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that it's my fault. If I hadn't come downstairs, maybe Dad wouldn't have gotten so angry. Maybe Mom wouldn't be hurt.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were a child. It wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I know that now, but... in that moment, I felt so guilty. So responsible.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I crawl into bed, pull the covers over my head. I can still hear them downstairs. I'm trying to block it out, but I can't. I'm so scared he'll come back.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. My stomach hurts. My throat feels tight from crying. I'm exhausted but too afraid to sleep.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Aisha. Stay with those feelings. What happens as the night goes on?",
    "Client: It gets quiet eventually. But I can't relax. Every little sound makes me jump. I keep thinking I hear footsteps coming up the stairs.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. What happens in the morning?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to get up. I'm dreading seeing them. But I have to go to school. When I go downstairs, Mom's in the kitchen. She's got bruises on her arms. She tries to smile at me, but I can see she's been crying.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing her like that?",
    "Client: Heartbroken. Angry. I want to help her, but I don't know how. I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Those are natural reactions. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I hug her. She holds me tight, tells me everything's okay. But I know it's not. Dad comes in and acts like nothing happened. I can't even look at him.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused. Angry. Part of me hates him for what he did, but another part still loves him and wants his approval. It's... it's messing me up.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex set of emotions. It's okay to feel conflicted.",
    "Client: Yeah... I eat breakfast in silence. The air feels so heavy. I want to say something, but I'm afraid of making things worse.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's around 65. It's... it's getting a bit easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens as you leave for school?",
    "Client: Mom hugs me extra tight. Whispers that she loves me. I can feel her shaking a little. I don't want to leave her, but I have to go. As I'm walking to school, I keep looking back at the house, worried about what might happen while I'm gone.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a heavy burden for a child to carry.",
    "Client: It was. I couldn't focus at school. I kept thinking about Mom, wondering if she was okay. I felt so guilty for not being there to protect her.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your responsibility to protect her.",
    "Client: I know that now, but back then... it felt like it was all on me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, thinking back on that day?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But I can see it more clearly now. I understand that I was just a kid, caught in a terrible situation. I couldn't have changed anything.",
    "Therapist: That's a very important realization. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. It still hurts, but... I feel like I can handle it better.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Aisha. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also kind of relieved? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength. Is there anything else you want to share before we end?",
    "Client: I just... I wish I could tell that little girl that it wasn't her fault. That she didn't deserve any of that.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful statement. Perhaps you can carry that compassion for your younger self forward.",
    "Client: Yeah... I think I will. It feels good to finally let her off the hook, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've made significant progress today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a great metaphor. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. This... this really helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Aisha. We'll continue working through this in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again."
