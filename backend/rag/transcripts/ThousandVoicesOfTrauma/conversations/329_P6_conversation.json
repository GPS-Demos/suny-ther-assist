    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that dimly lit room. The air feels heavy, and I can hear muffled voices from the next room. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the edge of the bed, my hands trembling slightly. I can smell alcohol and cigarette smoke. The door creaks open, and I see him stumble in. My stomach churns, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting more intense. Maybe a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's yelling at someone in the other room. I can hear things breaking. I want to run, but I'm frozen. My legs feel weak, and there's a lump in my throat. I'm terrified of what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He's coming closer. I can see the anger in his eyes. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) He's... he's grabbing my arm. It hurts. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. I'm trying to pull away, but he's too strong. I feel so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (nodding) I hear more shouting. Someone else enters the room. There's a scuffle. I'm huddled in the corner, trying to make myself invisible. The noise is deafening, but I feel like I'm underwater.",

    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I'm starting to feel a little more present.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to come back to the present. My heart is still racing, but I can feel the chair beneath me. The memory is fading.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... relieved, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but I feel like I've confronted something important. It was hard, but I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end."
