    "Therapist: Welcome back, Raj. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Johnson. I'm a bit nervous, but I understand it's part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 3 out of 10 right now. Just some mild anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and recall the incident. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm walking home from work, it's getting dark. I hear shouting... There's a commotion up ahead. I see... I see a man on the ground, and two police officers are... they're kicking him. My heart starts racing. I... I can't believe what I'm seeing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Angry. Helpless. My palms are sweating, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's... it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6, maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I want to help, but I'm frozen. I remember thinking, \"This could be me.\" I'm... I'm shaking. The man on the ground is crying out, begging them to stop. I can hear the thud of their boots. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel sick to my stomach. It's... it's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. Maybe even 9.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I know. It just feels so real. I... I see one of the officers look up. He sees me watching. I'm terrified he'll come after me next. I... I turn and run. I'm so ashamed. I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: It's a natural reaction. What do you notice as you run?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm out of breath. My legs feel like lead. I keep hearing the man's cries in my head. I... I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I make it home. I lock the door and slide down against it. I'm... I'm shaking uncontrollably. I feel so helpless, so angry at myself, at the police, at the world. I... I can't stop replaying it in my mind.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm starting to calm down a bit. My breathing is slowing. I still feel this heaviness in my chest, but it's... it's not as intense.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* That... that helps. I feel more grounded now. It's... it's still painful to remember, but I don't feel as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You did well. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But I think it helped. I feel... I feel like I faced something I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 4 now. I feel drained, but... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Raj. We'll end here."
