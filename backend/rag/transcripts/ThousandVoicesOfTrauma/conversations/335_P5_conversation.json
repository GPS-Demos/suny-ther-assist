    "Therapist: Mrs. Karim, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, dear. Though I must admit, I'm a bit nervous about what this entails. At my age, I've seen quite a lot, but reliving that horrible day... it's not something I look forward to.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let's start slowly. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: Well, you see, I worry that talking about it will bring back those awful feelings. The helplessness, the terror... I've worked so hard to push those memories away. And now, to purposely bring them back? It seems counterintuitive, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: I hear your concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: (sighs) I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm afraid it might make my depression worse. I've been doing better lately, and I don't want to slide back.",
    "Therapist: Valid concern. How might we address that?",
    "Client: Perhaps... if we go slowly? And if you could reassure me that it's okay to stop if it becomes too much? I know I need to face this, but the thought of being overwhelmed is frightening.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Having my husband nearby would be comforting. He's been my rock through all of this. And maybe... could we have some tea? It always calms my nerves.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Anything else you'd like to know?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. How long will this process take? And will I need to do this multiple times? The idea of reliving it once is daunting enough, let alone repeatedly.",
    "Therapist: It varies, but we'll take it step-by-step. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, dear. It's not easy being vulnerable at my age. But I trust you, and I want to get better. For myself, for my husband, for our grandchildren. I want to be present with them without this cloud hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yes, I think I'm ready now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than you know to have someone who understands and doesn't rush me. Let's face this old ghost together, shall we?"
