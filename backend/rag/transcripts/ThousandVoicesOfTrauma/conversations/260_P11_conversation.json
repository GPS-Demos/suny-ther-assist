    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I know we've been working on this childhood memory for a few sessions now, but it still feels so raw. I keep seeing my uncle's face, hearing his voice... It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so intense. I could feel my heart racing, just like it did back then. And the helplessness... I felt so small and powerless. It's strange because I know I'm an adult now, but in that moment, I was that little girl again, frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to talk about it now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like, I'm finally giving voice to something I've kept buried for so long. It's painful, but there's also this sense of... relief, I guess? Like I'm not carrying this secret alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has affected my relationships. I've always struggled to trust people, especially men. And now I can see why. It's like this childhood trauma has been this invisible barrier between me and others all along.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current life?",
    "Client: Well, I think it explains a lot about why I'm still living with my parents at 27. I've been too afraid to venture out on my own, to be vulnerable with others. And my unemployment... I wonder if my lack of confidence stems from this too. It's like I'm still that helpless child in some ways.",
    "Therapist: What are your thoughts on that insight?",
    "Client: It's... it's eye-opening. And a bit scary, to be honest. But also, it gives me hope? Like, now that I can see these connections, maybe I can start to change things. Maybe I can learn to trust again, to be more independent.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you move forward with this?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep facing these memories head-on, as hard as it is. And maybe start taking small steps towards independence. Like, maybe looking for a job, or considering moving out. It's terrifying, but I also feel like I'm ready to reclaim my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think I'll need help staying motivated. It's easy to feel empowered right after a session, but then the fear creeps back in. Maybe we could work on some coping strategies for when I'm feeling overwhelmed? And... I might need some encouragement to keep pushing myself out of my comfort zone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. Like I'm not doomed to be defined by what happened to me. It's scary, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something really important today. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy attitude. Take care, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. See you next week."
