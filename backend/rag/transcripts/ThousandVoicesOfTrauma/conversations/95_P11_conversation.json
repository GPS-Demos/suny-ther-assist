    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going back to that hospital room, remembering how scared I was when the doctor told me about my diagnosis... It's like I was right there again, you know? I could almost smell the disinfectant and hear the beeping machines.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The look on my parents' faces. They were trying so hard to be strong for me, but I could see the fear in their eyes. It made everything feel so much more real and terrifying. I remember thinking, \"If they're this scared, how bad is it really?\"",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that moment feel?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that same tightness in my chest that I had back then. But... it's strange. As awful as it was, I also felt... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I've been through this before, and I survived it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it relate to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it shows that I'm more resilient than I give myself credit for? I mean, I still have nightmares about hospitals and panic when I hear ambulance sirens, but remembering how I got through that diagnosis... it makes me think that maybe I can overcome these PTSD symptoms too.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent connection. What else?",
    "Client: Well, um, I noticed that during the imaginal, I was able to stay more present than I usually do when those memories come up. Normally, I'd try to push them away or distract myself, but this time I actually sat with the discomfort. It was hard, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of that progress. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to stop avoiding things that remind me of the hospital? Like, I've been putting off my regular check-ups because I'm scared of being back in a medical setting. But facing this memory head-on makes me think that maybe I can handle it. It won't be easy, but I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave step. Any other reflections?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. During the imaginal, I realized how much support I had around me during that time. My parents, my friends who visited... I've been so focused on the fear and trauma that I kind of forgot about all the love that was there too. It makes me feel less... alone, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How might that realization help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to lean on my support system more. I've been isolating myself, trying to deal with everything on my own. But remembering how much it helped to have people there for me then, it makes me want to open up more now. Maybe talk to my roommates about what I'm going through instead of just hiding in my room all the time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive plan. Anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: Just that... this was really hard, but I'm glad we did it. I feel drained, but also kind of... lighter? Like I've been carrying this heavy memory around, and now that I've faced it, it doesn't have as much power over me. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but... I want to keep going. If facing this memory can make me feel even a little bit better, then I want to see what else we can work through. It's scary, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I can get back to being me again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's what we're working towards. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again."
