    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about my time in the military always brings up a lot of mixed emotions. Part of me wants to get it out, but another part just wants to run away.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach's a bit knotted, but I'm not in full panic mode or anything.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the barracks. It's early morning, still dark outside. The air is heavy with humidity, and there's this constant buzzing of insects. I can smell the musty odor of unwashed uniforms and sweat. My bunkmates are still asleep, but I'm wide awake, staring at the ceiling.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. The whole building shakes. Alarms start blaring, and everyone's jolted awake. There's shouting, confusion. I leap out of bed, my heart racing. I'm fumbling to get my gear on, my hands shaking so badly I can barely tie my boots.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My mouth is dry, and I can taste bile in the back of my throat. But there's also this surge of adrenaline. I know I need to move, to act, but part of me just wants to hide under the bed like a child.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to about 60. My palms are sweating, and my heart's pounding pretty hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... We're rushing outside. The air is thick with smoke and dust. I can hear gunfire in the distance, and there are more explosions. People are running everywhere. I see one of my friends, Tom, he's bleeding from a cut on his forehead. I grab him, and we start moving towards our designated rally point.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Chaos. Pure chaos. Buildings are on fire, vehicles are overturned. There's debris everywhere. I see... oh God, I see bodies. Some of them aren't moving. The smell is overwhelming - smoke, explosives, and something else... something sickly sweet that I later realize is burning flesh.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like I'm watching it all happen to someone else. But at the same time, every nerve in my body is screaming. My training kicks in, and I'm moving, acting, but it's like I'm on autopilot.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We make it to the rally point. Our sergeant is there, barking orders. He's bleeding too, but he's still in command. He's telling us to form a defensive perimeter. I take position behind a partially collapsed wall. My rifle feels heavy in my hands, and I'm struggling to control my breathing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm behind this wall, and suddenly there's gunfire. Not in the distance, but right there. Bullets are hitting the wall, sending chips of concrete flying. I return fire, but I can barely see where it's coming from. The noise is deafening. I can smell the gunpowder, feel the heat from my rifle.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this is it. This is how I die. But I'm also angry. Furious that this is happening, that my friends are in danger. And there's this bizarre clarity. Every sound, every smell, every sensation is incredibly vivid.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever, but it's probably only a few minutes. Then there's a lull. I hear someone shouting for a medic. I peek over the wall and see one of our guys down in the open. Without thinking, I sprint out to grab him. As I'm dragging him back, I feel this... this impact. Like being hit by a sledgehammer. I realize I've been shot.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel?",
    "Client: At first, nothing. Just surprise. Then this spreading warmth. I look down and see blood soaking through my uniform. The pain hits a moment later, sharp and burning. I'm still dragging my buddy, but my legs are getting weak. I'm scared, more scared than I've ever been in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... okay. I manage to get behind cover. Someone's putting pressure on my wound. It hurts like hell, but the pain is almost welcome because it means I'm still alive. I can hear the medevac chopper coming in. The noise of the rotors is overwhelming everything else.",
    "Therapist: What happens as the chopper arrives?",
    "Client: They're loading us up. The movement is agony. I'm starting to feel cold, and I know that's bad. I'm looking up at the sky, watching the smoke swirl above us. As we lift off, I can see the whole base. It looks like something out of a war movie, not real life. But it is real. Too real.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're being evacuated?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also... guilty. I'm leaving my unit behind. I don't know who else is hurt, who might be... who might not have made it. I'm fading in and out of consciousness. The last thing I remember is one of the medics telling me to hang on, that I'm going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm... I'm back.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Shaky. But... also a bit lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50. Still elevated, but not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But I think... I think it was necessary. I've never talked about that day in so much detail before. It's always been this big, scary thing in my mind, but facing it like this... it's still scary, but maybe a bit less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take a few more minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Um, okay. I see the plant in the corner, your desk lamp, the bookshelf, the clock on the wall, and the painting of the mountains.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my watch, and the cushion I'm sitting on.",
    "Therapist: Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, some traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Your air freshener, I think it's lavender? And coffee - I can still smell it from earlier.",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. Grounded, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Remember to use these grounding techniques if you feel overwhelmed between sessions. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. Just... thank you. This was hard, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've done excellent work today. Remember to be kind to yourself and practice self-care. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: See you next week. Thanks again."
