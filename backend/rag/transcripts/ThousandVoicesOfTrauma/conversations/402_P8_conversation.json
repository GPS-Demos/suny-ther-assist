    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also frozen at the same time. The memory of that accident at work, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of metal, the shouts... (takes a deep breath) My heart is pounding, and my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had done something differently? Maybe if I had been more alert, or if I had warned my coworker sooner... (voice trembles) I feel so guilty. And scared. Like it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I feel nauseous, and my shoulders are so tense. It's like my body is bracing for impact all over again.",
    "Therapist: And as you sit with those sensations, what comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel so vulnerable. Like the world isn't safe anymore. I used to love my job, but now... now I'm terrified of going back. What if something like that happens again? I don't think I could handle it. (starts to cry softly)",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time.",
    "Client: (after a moment) I just... I feel so ashamed. Everyone else seems to have moved on, but I'm still stuck. Why can't I just get over it? I should be stronger than this.",
    "Therapist: How do those expectations impact you?",
    "Client: They make me feel worse. Like I'm failing somehow. I try to push myself to be \"normal\" again, but then I have these panic attacks, and... and it feels like I'm right back there in that moment. I'm exhausted all the time from trying to keep it together.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to hide away from everything. But another part... I guess I want someone to understand. To not judge me for still being affected by this. Maybe... maybe to tell me it's okay to not be okay yet.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that need?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. But also scary. I'm not used to asking for help or admitting weakness. In my family, we're supposed to be strong, to handle things on our own. But this... this feels too big to handle alone.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has changed me. I used to be so confident, so sure of myself. Now I second-guess everything. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next disaster. It's like... like I've lost a part of myself. And I don't know how to get it back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How are you coping with these changes?",
    "Client: Not well, I think. I've been isolating myself a lot. My roommates probably think I'm antisocial now. I've picked up some... not great habits. Drinking more than I should, sometimes. Just to quiet my mind, you know? And I've been having these awful nightmares. I'm scared to sleep sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you think about these coping mechanisms?",
    "Client: I... I know they're not healthy. But in the moment, they feel like the only way to get through. It's like I'm constantly trying to outrun my own thoughts and memories. But they always catch up eventually. (sighs) I'm so tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: What would feeling better look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel safe again. To be able to go to work without having a panic attack. To sleep through the night without nightmares. To laugh with my friends without this dark cloud hanging over me. I want to feel like myself again, I guess. But I don't know if that's even possible anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful, but also scary. Like, what if I can't get there? What if this is just who I am now? But... but I want to try. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to find a way through this, even if I'm not sure what that looks like yet.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I feel... determined, I think. And a little scared. But also... maybe a tiny bit hopeful? Like, talking about it like this, it doesn't feel quite as overwhelming. It's still huge, but... maybe not impossible? I don't know. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel conflicted. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been holding in. How much I've been trying to pretend everything's fine. It's... it's actually a relief to say all this out loud. To admit that I'm struggling. I didn't realize how much energy I was spending trying to keep it all together.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to let some of that out?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I can breathe a little easier. Like some of the pressure has been released. I'm still anxious, still scared, but... it feels a little less lonely now. Like maybe I don't have to face all of this by myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you want to do with this awareness?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to keep talking about it. To stop trying to hide how I'm feeling all the time. Maybe... maybe reach out to some friends I've been avoiding. And... and I want to keep working on this in therapy. It's hard, and scary, but... I think it might be helping.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, honestly. But also a little lighter. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I didn't even realize I was carrying. I'm still scared about the future, about facing these memories, but... but I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. With help.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... I think I needed it. I'll see you next week."
