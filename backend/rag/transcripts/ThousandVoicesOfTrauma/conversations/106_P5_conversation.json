    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about my illness, and it's been affecting my work and my relationship with my wife. I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that mean? I'm not sure I want to relive those hospital experiences. They were terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It's a way to process your trauma. We'll go through it together, step by step.",
    "Client: But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart? I've worked so hard to keep it together for my family. I don't want to disappoint them or show weakness.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process is about healing, not weakness.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about being in that hospital, feeling so helpless and alone, my heart starts racing. I can almost smell the disinfectant and hear the beeping machines. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. We'll work through them at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you. But can you tell me more about what to expect? Will I have to close my eyes? Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. You can keep your eyes open if preferred.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I think I'd feel more grounded with my eyes open. How long will this take? And what if I need to stop?",
    "Therapist: We'll go for about 30 minutes. You can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I can manage that. Will this really help with my symptoms? The nightmares, the anxiety, the constant feeling of being on edge?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective for many. Your courage is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm trying to be brave, but it's hard. Sometimes I feel like that illness took away a part of me that I'll never get back. But I want to get better, for myself and my family.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yes. I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. I just hope it helps. I want to feel like myself again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Understood. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your guidance. Okay, deep breath... I'm ready to start whenever you are."
