    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel a bit shaky. The memory of the accident, it just... it felt so real again. I could almost smell the gasoline and hear the screeching tires.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe it's more like... panic? It's this overwhelming sense of helplessness. Like I'm back in that moment, trapped in the car, and I can't do anything to change what's happening. I keep thinking about how close I came to... to not making it out. And then I feel guilty because I did survive, and others didn't.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight in my chest. I find myself wondering why I survived when others didn't. Was it just random chance? Did I do something to deserve to live that they didn't? And then I feel terrible for even thinking that because who am I to judge who deserves to live or die? It's just... it's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and I feel this tightness in my throat. It's hard to swallow. My shoulders are so tense, they're almost up to my ears. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to what you felt during the accident?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. During the accident, it was like everything was amplified. The fear was paralyzing, and I couldn't even breathe. Now, it's more like an echo of those feelings. It's still uncomfortable, but I can manage it better. I'm able to remind myself that I'm here, in this room, and not back there in the car.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the moments before the crash. I wonder if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had left the house five minutes later, or taken a different route... And then I think about how this has affected my relationships, especially with my husband. He's been so supportive, but I know it's been hard on him too. I worry that I'm not the same person he married, that maybe I'll never be that person again.",
    "Therapist: How does that concern about your relationship impact you?",
    "Client: It... it scares me. A lot. I love my husband, and the thought of losing him because of how this trauma has changed me... it's almost as terrifying as the accident itself. I find myself pulling away sometimes, like I'm trying to protect him from the mess that is my mind right now. But then I worry that by pulling away, I'm actually pushing him away. It's this constant internal struggle.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your anxiety in these moments?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, lurking in the background. But when I think about potentially losing my relationship, it spikes. My chest gets tight, and I start to feel panicky. It's like my brain goes into overdrive, imagining all these worst-case scenarios. What if he gets tired of dealing with my nightmares? What if he decides it's too much and leaves? And then I feel guilty for not trusting in our relationship, in him.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to your anxiety before the accident?",
    "Client: Before the accident, my anxiety was... manageable, I guess? It was mostly work-related stress or normal relationship worries. But now, it's like it's on steroids. Everything feels more intense, more threatening. Simple things that I never used to worry about now feel like potential disasters waiting to happen. It's exhausting, constantly being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful in managing these feelings?",
    "Client: Deep breathing helps sometimes. When I feel the panic rising, I try to focus on my breath, counting slowly as I inhale and exhale. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it helps ground me. I've also been trying to talk to my husband more about how I'm feeling, even though it's hard. And... this might sound silly, but I've started keeping a gratitude journal. On really bad days, it helps to remind myself of the good things I still have in my life.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the progress you're making?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Some days, I feel like I'm making real progress. I can go longer without having a flashback, or I'm able to drive short distances without panicking. But then there are days where it feels like I'm right back at square one, and all the progress I've made just disappears. It's frustrating and disheartening. I want so badly to feel \"normal\" again, but I'm not even sure what that means anymore.",
    "Therapist: What does recovery look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess I want to feel safe again. To be able to drive without constantly scanning for potential dangers. To sleep through the night without nightmares. To not feel guilty for surviving. To be able to enjoy time with my husband without this constant cloud of anxiety hanging over us. I want to feel like me again, but... I'm starting to realize that maybe I need to redefine what \"me\" means now. Maybe recovery isn't about going back to who I was, but learning to accept and work with who I am now.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of redefining yourself make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... scary, but also kind of liberating? On one hand, it feels like giving up on the old me, which is sad. But on the other hand, it feels like maybe I can stop fighting so hard against this new reality and start figuring out how to live with it. Maybe I can take the strength I've found through surviving this trauma and use it to build something new. It's not what I would have chosen, but... maybe it doesn't have to be all bad.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I... I guess I've realized I'm more resilient than I ever thought. There were days I didn't think I'd make it through, but I did. I'm still here. I'm still trying. And I've learned to be more honest about my feelings, both with myself and with others. Before, I always tried to be the strong one, to handle everything on my own. Now, I'm learning that it's okay to ask for help, to lean on others. It's not always easy, but it feels... authentic, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your perspective on life?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me realize how fragile life is, but also how precious. I find myself appreciating the small things more - a quiet moment with my husband, a beautiful sunset, even just the feeling of being safe in my own home. I'm trying to be more present in each moment, because I know now how quickly things can change. And I think... I think it's made me more empathetic. I find myself reaching out to others who are struggling, because I know now how much a kind word or a listening ear can mean.",
    "Therapist: As we wrap up, what's one thing you'd like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on communicating more openly with my husband about my fears and anxieties, especially regarding our relationship. It's scary, but I think it's important. And maybe... maybe we could explore more ways for me to cope with the anxiety when it spikes. I want to keep building on the progress we've made.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. We'll pick up there next time."
