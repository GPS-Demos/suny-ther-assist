    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. Not terrible, but definitely on edge.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process this together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at the hospital. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the waiting room. The chairs are uncomfortable, and there's this antiseptic smell that's making me nauseous. My wife, Sarah, she's sitting next to me. We're both quiet, but I can feel how tense she is.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A doctor comes out. He's wearing blue scrubs, and he looks... he looks tired. He asks us to follow him to a private room, and I just know... I know it's bad news.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can barely breathe. I... I want to run away, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We sit down in this small room. There are no windows, just these harsh fluorescent lights. The doctor starts talking, but it's like I can't hear him properly. Everything's muffled. Then... then I catch the words \"I'm sorry\" and \"we did everything we could.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present in that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: No, no, no. This can't be happening. My dad... he was fine just a few days ago. We were planning a fishing trip. I... I can't believe this is real.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm shaking. I want to scream, but nothing's coming out. Sarah's gripping my hand so hard it hurts, but I barely notice.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave for facing this. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. The doctor's still talking. Something about a sudden heart attack. But all I can think about is how I should've visited more often. I should've made more time...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What else are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. So much guilt. And anger. Why didn't they catch this earlier? Why didn't I make him go for more check-ups?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We leave the room. The hallway seems so long. People are walking by, but it's like they're in slow motion. I feel disconnected from everything.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still around 75. It's not getting easier.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we have to go identify the body. God, I don't want to do this. But I know I have to. For Dad.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What do you see when you enter the room?",
    "Client: He's there, on a table. He looks... he looks like he's sleeping. But he's so pale. I keep expecting him to open his eyes, to sit up and laugh about this awful joke. But he doesn't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Despair. Complete and utter despair. This man who's always been there, who taught me everything... he's gone. Just like that.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that despair. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, John. Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present for a moment.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I... I reach out to touch his hand. It's cold. So cold. And that's when it really hits me. He's gone. My dad is gone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that realization. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm not ready for this. How am I supposed to live without him? Who's going to give me advice now? Who's going to be there for my kids?",
    "Therapist: These are all valid concerns. How does your body feel as these thoughts come up?",
    "Client: My legs feel weak. I think I'm going to collapse. Sarah's holding me up, but I can barely feel her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. This is almost unbearable.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult, but you're handling it well. Take another deep breath. What happens after this moment?",
    "Client: We... we have to leave. There's paperwork to fill out. It feels so wrong, so clinical. Like my dad's just been reduced to a bunch of forms.",
    "Therapist: That must have been frustrating. How do you handle it?",
    "Client: I go through the motions. I'm signing things, but I don't even know what I'm signing. It's like I'm on autopilot.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to shock. What are you feeling during this process?",
    "Client: Numb. Just... numb. Like this isn't real. Like I'm watching someone else go through this.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 80. The numbness... it's almost a relief.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What happens when you finish with the paperwork?",
    "Client: We leave the hospital. The sun is shining, and it feels wrong. How can the world just go on like nothing's happened?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after a loss. What do you do next?",
    "Client: We get in the car. Sarah offers to drive, but I insist on doing it. I need to feel in control of something.",
    "Therapist: How does that drive home feel?",
    "Client: It's surreal. The radio's playing some upbeat song, and I want to smash it. How can anyone be happy right now?",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back up to 85. The anger... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Anger is a natural part of grief. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: We walk in, and everything looks the same. But it feels different. Empty. I go straight to Dad's favorite chair and just... sit there.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about all the times he sat here. All the conversations we had. All the ones we'll never have now.",
    "Therapist: Those are painful thoughts. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still at 85. It's not going down.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're processing a lot. What happens next?",
    "Client: Sarah asks if I want to call anyone. Family, friends. But I can't. I can't say the words out loud. It would make it too real.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How do you handle it?",
    "Client: I just shake my head. She understands. She always understands.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like Sarah is a good support for you. What do you do after that?",
    "Client: I just sit there. For hours. The light changes, it gets dark, but I don't move. I can't.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm replaying every moment with my dad. Every argument, every laugh. Wondering if I told him I loved him enough. If he knew how much he meant to me.",
    "Therapist: Those are natural thoughts after a loss. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 75. I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've been through a lot. How does the day end?",
    "Client: Sarah finally convinces me to go to bed. But I can't sleep. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling, feeling like the world has ended.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a long night. How do you feel now, reflecting on all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But maybe... maybe a little less overwhelming? I don't know.",
    "Therapist: That's progress, John. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's about 70 now. Still high, but... better than it was.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, John. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: Drained. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises, and we'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Take care of yourself this week."
