    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that home invasion memory again... it's like I was right back there, you know? My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sound of glass breaking. It was so loud in my mind. I could almost feel the shards under my feet as I ran to check on my daughter. And the fear... it was suffocating.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that moment?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. But... also different somehow. Like, I knew I was here, safe, even while reliving it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does this compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, usually when I think about it, I just shut down. But this time, I stayed with it. It was hard, but I did it. I guess that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that night. Even little things, like locking the doors obsessively or not watching certain TV shows. It's affected so much of my life.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening. And a bit sad, to be honest. I've let this fear control me for so long. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like, now that I see it, I can start to change it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you think could be a first step?",
    "Client: Um, maybe... not checking the locks so many times before bed? That's been a big one for me. It's scary to think about, but I know it's not really keeping me safer.",
    "Therapist: How might that change things for you?",
    "Client: I guess it could help me feel more... normal? Less controlled by fear. And maybe I'd sleep better without that ritual hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great goal. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, no doubt. But I'm starting to see why we're doing this. It's like... facing the monster under the bed and realizing it can't actually hurt me anymore. I'm nervous, but I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's giving you strength?",
    "Client: My daughter, mostly. I want to be fully present for her, not always looking over my shoulder. And... myself, I suppose. I'm tired of feeling like a victim.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: Maybe we could... I don't know, practice some grounding techniques? Sometimes I feel like I'm getting lost in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestion. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that terrible night.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: Could we maybe do a quick relaxation exercise? Just to help me transition back to the rest of my day?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
