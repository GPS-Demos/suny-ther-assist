    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm at the bank. It's a normal day, busy but not too crowded. I'm in line, waiting to deposit my paycheck. Everything seems fine, and then... oh god, I hear shouting. There's a man waving a gun, telling everyone to get down. My heart is racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The man with the gun is yelling at the tellers, demanding money. Everyone around me is on the floor, some people are crying. I can smell someone's coffee that spilled when we all dropped to the ground. My chest feels tight, and I'm trying not to make any noise.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My anxiety is definitely increasing. The memory feels so real. I'd say my SUDS is at an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The robber is getting more agitated. He's shouting that if anyone moves, he'll shoot. I can hear police sirens in the distance, and the man starts to panic. He grabs a woman near him and puts the gun to her head. I'm terrified he's going to kill her. My whole body is shaking, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I can try. The police are outside now, and they're trying to negotiate. The man is screaming, the woman is sobbing, and I just keep thinking that any moment, he could start shooting. I'm so scared, I feel like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding, and I feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back there. My SUDS is still at a 9.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. At first, I think it's a gunshot, but it's actually the police breaking in. Everything happens so fast. The robber is tackled, the hostage is freed, and it's over. But I can't stop shaking. I feel relief, but also this intense, overwhelming anxiety.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky and anxious, but knowing it's over helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? It was really hard to go through that again, but I did it.",
