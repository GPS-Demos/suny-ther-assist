    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cyberbullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was sitting at my computer, scrolling through social media. It was late, around 11 PM. I saw a notification. Someone had tagged me in a post. I clicked on it, and... (voice trembles) there it was. A photo of me from the company party, but it was edited. They made me look... huge. Like a balloon. The caption said, \"Look at the office whale!\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt my heart racing. My palms got sweaty. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The comments started pouring in. \"Fatty,\" \"Pig,\" \"No wonder she can't get a date.\" I wanted to cry, to scream, to throw my laptop across the room. But I just sat there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't look away. I kept scrolling, reading every horrible comment. Some were from people I thought were my friends. Others were from strangers. It felt like the whole world was laughing at me. I felt so alone, so exposed. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I tried to report the post, but my hands were shaking so badly I could barely use the mouse. When I finally managed to do it, nothing happened. The post stayed up. More and more people were sharing it. I saw my phone light up with messages. People asking if I'd seen it, some pretending to be concerned, others just wanting to gossip.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I felt so helpless. I couldn't make it stop. I couldn't defend myself. Every ping, every notification felt like a physical blow. I started to feel sick to my stomach. I ran to the bathroom and threw up. When I came back, there were even more comments. Someone had made a meme out of the picture. It was everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I didn't sleep that night. I kept checking my phone, my computer, hoping it would all go away. But it didn't. By morning, it had spread to other platforms. People I didn't even know were sending me hateful messages. I called in sick to work. I couldn't face anyone. I felt so ashamed, so humiliated. I wanted to crawl into a hole and never come out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings back all those feelings of shame and helplessness. But also... I feel a little stronger. Like I'm facing it head-on instead of running away. It still hurts, but maybe not as sharply as before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it helps. I've been carrying this around for so long, afraid to tell anyone. Afraid they'd judge me or tell me to just get over it. But it's not that simple, is it?",
    "Therapist: No, it's not. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: I think what hurts the most is how quickly people I thought were friends turned on me. Or stayed silent. It made me question every relationship I had. I became paranoid, always wondering what people were really thinking about me. I stopped going out, stopped answering calls. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Sometimes I still have nightmares about it. I dream that I'm standing in a crowded room, and everyone's pointing and laughing at me. I try to run, but I can't move. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling just as helpless as I did that night. It's like it never really ends, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. You're doing well facing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. My heart's racing again, just like it did then. But I know I'm here, in your office, not back in that terrible night. It's just... it still feels so real sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're in control here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm okay. It's just... talking about it makes it feel so fresh. But I know it's in the past. I'm not that same person anymore. I'm stronger now, even if I don't always feel like it. I'm here, talking about it, facing it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to stop for now. This was intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Is that normal? To feel both drained and somehow lighter at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. I know we still have more work to do, but I feel like I can face it now. It's not easy, but I'm not alone anymore. And that makes all the difference.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress. We'll continue next time."
