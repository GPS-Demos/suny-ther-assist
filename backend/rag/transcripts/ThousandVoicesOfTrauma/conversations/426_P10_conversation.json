    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit on edge, I guess. I know we're going to talk about the accident, and that makes me feel kind of jittery.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a quick SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40? My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Just give me a second to... to get myself together.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright. I'm... I'm in my friend's car. We're driving back from uni. It's late afternoon, and the sun is really bright. I remember squinting a bit...",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The radio's on, some pop song. I can't remember which one exactly, but it's upbeat. We're laughing about something... I think it was a joke about our professor. Then... then I see it. This other car, it's coming so fast from the side street.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart... it's racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. I want to yell, to warn my friend, but it's like... like my voice is stuck. I can't... I can't get the words out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Rahul. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The impact. It's... it's so loud. Like a explosion. The car spins, and I'm thrown against the door. Everything's a blur of motion and noise. I can hear metal crunching, glass breaking. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up. Maybe 70? My palms are really sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Can you ground yourself by feeling the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. *pause* The chair... it's solid. Cool leather. I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Right. So, the car's stopped spinning. It's quiet now, eerily quiet. I'm... I'm dizzy, and my head hurts. I look over at my friend, and he's slumped over the steering wheel. There's blood... blood on his face. I'm panicking, I don't know what to do. I'm fumbling with my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking so much...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"Is he dead? Is this my fault? Did I distract him?\" I finally get my seatbelt off, but when I try to move, there's this sharp pain in my side. I gasp, and it hurts to breathe. I can smell petrol, and I'm scared the car might explode.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Remember, you survived this. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear people outside. Someone's yelling to call an ambulance. A man appears at my window, asking if I'm okay. I try to speak, but I just... I just start crying. I can't stop. It's like all the fear and shock just... just pours out of me.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. How are you feeling now, reliving this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's still racing. But... but I feel a bit more in control than I did then. Maybe... maybe a 60 on the SUDS scale now?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. So, the paramedics arrive. They're careful getting us out of the car. I keep asking about my friend, but no one will give me a straight answer. They put me on a stretcher, and I'm looking around, trying to see him. The sun's so bright, it hurts my eyes. I close them, and I can hear the sirens, people talking urgently. I'm in the ambulance now, and someone's asking me questions, but I can barely focus. I just keep thinking about my friend, hoping he's okay.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I noticed I was clenching my fists too.",
    "Therapist: Try to relax those areas. What happens at the hospital?",
    "Client: At the hospital, it's a whirlwind. Doctors, nurses, tests. They tell me I have a concussion and some bruised ribs. But I keep asking about my friend. Finally, a nurse tells me he's in surgery. I remember feeling so... so helpless. Just lying there, not knowing if he'd be okay. My parents show up, and my mum's crying. That's when it really hits me how serious it all is.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This kind of thing happens to other people, not me.\" And I feel... I feel so guilty. If we hadn't been joking around, maybe my friend would have seen the car coming. Maybe we could have avoided it all.",
    "Therapist: Remember, Rahul, the accident wasn't your fault. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 50? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also kind of... I don't know, releasing?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. I'm discharged, but my friend's still in the hospital. I visit him every day. He's... he's okay, but he has a long recovery ahead. I have nightmares about the crash. Sometimes I wake up gasping, feeling like I'm back in that moment of impact. During the day, I jump at loud noises. Cars passing by too quickly make me freeze up.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these reactions?",
    "Client: At first, I didn't cope well. I... I started avoiding going out. I'd make excuses not to get in cars. I felt safest just staying in my room. But that made me feel isolated, you know? And the anxiety... it didn't really go away. It just... changed focus.",
    "Therapist: That's common after trauma. How are you feeling now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's not easy. But it's better than I expected. Like, I can talk about it without feeling like I'm right back there. My heart rate's pretty much normal now. Maybe... maybe a 40 on the SUDS scale?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Rahul. Let's start wrapping up. Can you bring yourself back to the present moment?",
    "Client: Yeah, I can do that. *deep breath* I'm here, in your office. The sun's coming through the window, and I can hear traffic outside. But it doesn't make me as anxious as it used to.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How are you feeling overall about this session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling okay. Tired, but... but kind of relieved? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying around. It's still there, but it's not as heavy, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That makes perfect sense. You've done great work today, Rahul.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I think this is helping. It's not easy, but... but I think I'm starting to process it all better.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue working on this. For now, what would you like to do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might go for a walk. Being outside, it used to make me nervous after the accident. But maybe... maybe it'll be good to remind myself that I can do it. That I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. Remember to use your coping strategies if you need them. I'll see you next week, Rahul.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. See you then."
