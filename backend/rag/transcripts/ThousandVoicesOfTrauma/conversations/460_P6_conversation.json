    "Therapist: Okay, Ahmad. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. Now, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Alright... I'm there. It's the day my grandmother passed away. I'm in her hospital room. The smell of disinfectant is overwhelming. I can hear the beeping of machines...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm sitting by her bed. Her hand feels so fragile in mine. I can see how pale she is, how labored her breathing has become. The doctor just left the room after telling us she doesn't have much time left. I... I feel this heaviness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight. I'm trying not to cry because I want to be strong for her, but it's so hard. I keep thinking about all the times she took care of me when I was sick as a child. Now I can't do anything to help her.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) She opens her eyes and looks at me. Her gaze is unfocused, but I think she recognizes me. I want to say something, but the words won't come out. I'm scared this might be our last moment together.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel a bit dizzy, like the room is spinning. My palms are sweaty, and I'm gripping the armrest of the chair.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're doing great. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay... I'm watching her chest rise and fall. Each breath seems like it could be her last. I'm struck by how unfair this feels. She was always so full of life, and now...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: The monitor starts beeping erratically. A nurse rushes in, checks the machines, and then looks at me with sympathy. I know what it means, but I can't accept it. I'm pleading with my grandmother to stay, telling her how much I love her, how much I still need her...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) It's a 9. I can feel the tears on my face, just like that day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Ahmad. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Sniffling) The beeping stops, replaced by a long, continuous tone. The nurse turns off the machine and says something I can't quite hear. My grandmother's hand goes limp in mine. I... I can't believe she's gone. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here with me, in a safe place.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) It's just... it feels so real. Like I'm losing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's pause here. Open your eyes and look around the room.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, breathing heavily) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe. But my heart is still pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did really well, Ahmad. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after an exposure exercise. Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few minutes to process what you experienced..."
