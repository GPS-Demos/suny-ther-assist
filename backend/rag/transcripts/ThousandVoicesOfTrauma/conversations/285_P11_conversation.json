    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the car accident... it felt so real, like I was right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The screeching tires, the crunch of metal... It's funny, you know? In my everyday life, I barely notice car sounds anymore. But in that memory, it's like every noise is amplified. And the smell of burnt rubber... I swear I could actually smell it during the exposure.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that compare to your usual thoughts about the accident?",
    "Client: It was... more intense, definitely. Usually, I try to push those memories away as quickly as possible. But going through it step-by-step like that, I noticed things I hadn't before. Like, I remembered the song that was playing on the radio just before the crash. It's strange how those little details can stick with you.",
    "Therapist: What emotions came up for you?",
    "Client: Fear, mostly. A lot of fear. But also... guilt, I think. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, you know? If I had been paying more attention or reacted faster... Maybe it's stupid, but part of me feels responsible, even though logically I know it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt relate to your broader experiences?",
    "Client: I... hmm. I guess it ties into how I've been feeling since I got back from my deployment. There's this constant sense that I should have done more, saved more lives. It's like the accident and my combat experiences are all mixed up in my head now.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did today's session impact your view of these experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. But I think it helped me see how much I've been avoiding. Not just the accident, but a lot of my feelings about what happened overseas too. It's all connected, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's an important insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: Scared, to be honest. But also... maybe a little hopeful? It's hard, but I think I'm starting to understand my reactions better. And that feels like progress, even if it's small.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What helped you get through today's exposure?",
    "Client: I kept reminding myself that I was safe here, in your office. And focusing on my breathing like we practiced... that helped a lot. It's still hard to believe that just talking about it can make a difference, but I do feel a bit lighter now.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent coping strategies. Any other observations?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. I noticed that as we went through the memory, the intensity of the emotions kind of... wavered? Like, it would spike and then ease off a bit. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does recognizing that pattern affect you?",
    "Client: It's... reassuring, I guess. Knowing that even the worst feelings don't last forever. It makes me think that maybe I can handle this after all. It's still scary, but... maybe not impossible.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to remember that when I'm having flashbacks or nightmares. That they'll pass, even if they feel overwhelming in the moment. And maybe I can try using some of the breathing techniques we've practiced when things get intense.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about our next session?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... I think I'm ready. This is hard work, but I can see how it might help. And I want to get better, for myself and for my family. They've been so patient with me through all of this.",
    "Therapist: That's great motivation. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward. Even if it's just a small step, it feels important.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I'll be here. It's tough, but... I'm committed to this. I want my life back, you know? And this feels like the way to do it. Even if it's scary, even if it hurts sometimes... I think it's worth it. I have to believe that."
