    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the workplace trauma you experienced?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important for my recovery.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm at my office, it's just another ordinary day. Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. At first, I think it's just a tremor, but it keeps getting stronger. Papers are falling off desks, and I can hear people screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking is so violent now. I'm trying to get under my desk, but I'm struggling to keep my balance. I can hear glass shattering and furniture toppling over. The lights are flickering, and I'm terrified they'll go out completely.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I can smell dust and something electrical burning. People are rushing past my office, shouting to get out. But I'm frozen. I can't move. My heart is pounding so hard, I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The ceiling starts to crack above me. I'm convinced it's going to collapse and crush me. I finally force myself to move, but my legs feel like jelly. I stumble out of my office, and the hallway is chaos. People are pushing and shoving to get to the stairs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I join the crowd, feeling claustrophobic and panicked. We're all trying to get down the stairs, but it's so difficult with the building still shaking. I can hear people crying and praying. I'm holding onto the railing for dear life, convinced that any moment the stairs might give way beneath us.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: As we finally reach the ground floor, there's a moment of relief, but it's short-lived. We rush out onto the street, and it's like a war zone. Buildings are crumbling, car alarms are blaring, and there's dust everywhere. I can't breathe properly, and my eyes are stinging.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling shaky. My palms are sweating, and my heart is racing. But I'm also surprised that I can talk about it without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a sign of progress. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, though. I remember standing there on the street, watching my workplace partially collapse. I felt so helpless and vulnerable. Everything I thought was solid and secure was literally crumbling before my eyes.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes it doesn't feel like it. I keep expecting the ground to start shaking again. Every little tremor or vibration sends me into a panic. I've been struggling to go back to work in tall buildings. It feels like nowhere is safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... the aftermath was almost as bad as the earthquake itself. The uncertainty, the aftershocks, the constant fear. I couldn't sleep properly for weeks. Every noise would wake me up, thinking it was another quake starting.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Surprisingly, a bit better. Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm letting go of some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still scary, but maybe not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I do feel a sense of accomplishment, even though it's difficult. I just hope that one day I can think about this without feeling like I'm right back in that moment of terror.",
    "Therapist: With time and work, you will. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's a relief to talk about this with someone who understands. I've felt so isolated in my fear, like no one else could possibly understand what I'm going through. But you're helping me see that I can face this and maybe even overcome it.",
    "Therapist: That's what we're here for. You're not alone.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'm ready to stop for now. This has been intense, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit freeing? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. Well done today."
