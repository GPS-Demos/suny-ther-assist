    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been trying to avoid thinking about what happened during that hostage situation. The idea of purposely revisiting it makes me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it in detail might make things worse. I've been having nightmares and flashbacks already. What if this makes them more frequent or intense? And... I'm scared of how I might react. What if I completely fall apart during the session?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, that would be helpful. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still apprehensive about the whole thing. Can you explain why we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories, reducing their power over time.",
    "Client: I see. So, you're saying that by facing these memories head-on, I might actually be able to lessen their impact? That's... encouraging, I suppose. But it still sounds really difficult.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but you'll be supported throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will we be doing? And how long will it take? I'm worried about getting too overwhelmed and not being able to continue.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the event in detail. You'll describe it aloud while I guide you. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That sounds like a long time to be focusing on such a difficult memory. Will I have to do the whole thing in one go, or can we take breaks if it gets too intense?",
    "Therapist: We'll aim for continuous narration, but can pause if needed. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I appreciate that you're willing to be flexible. I guess another concern I have is... well, I've worked hard to build a life after what happened. I'm worried that bringing it all up again might set me back in my progress. Is that a possibility?",
    "Therapist: It's a common worry, but exposure typically leads to improvement, not setbacks. Your resilience is key.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I've overcome a lot already, so I suppose I can handle this too. It's just... intimidating. But if you think it will help, I'm willing to try. What should I expect to feel during and after the session?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions, physical sensations. We'll work through them together. After, you might feel drained.",
    "Client: Strong emotions I can handle, I think. It's the physical sensations that worry me a bit. During the hostage situation, I had a panic attack. What if that happens again?",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Remember, you're safe here. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: That's helpful to know. I think... maybe it would help if we had a code word or signal I could use if I need a break or feel like I'm getting too overwhelmed. Would that be okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's choose a word now. What would you like it to be?",
    "Client: How about \"lighthouse\"? It reminds me of safety and guidance. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: \"Lighthouse\" it is. Excellent choice. Anything else you'd like to discuss before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I'm still nervous, but I understand why we're doing this now. And I appreciate how patient and understanding you've been with all my questions and concerns. It really helps to know that you'll be here guiding me through this. So... I guess we should start?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's begin when you're ready. Take a deep breath."
