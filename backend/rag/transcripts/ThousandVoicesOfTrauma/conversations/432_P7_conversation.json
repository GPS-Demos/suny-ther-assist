    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the home invasion?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my bedroom, studying late at night. It was around 2 AM, and I heard a noise downstairs. At first, I thought it might be my roommate coming home, but then I remembered he was out of town. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I got up slowly, trying not to make any noise. As I approached my bedroom door, I heard footsteps on the stairs. I froze, my hand on the doorknob. The footsteps got closer, and I could hear heavy breathing. I was terrified, my whole body was shaking...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: I understand it's difficult. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... The doorknob started to turn. I panicked and tried to hold it shut, but they were stronger. The door burst open, and there was a man there, wearing a mask. He grabbed me and threw me onto the bed. I tried to scream, but he covered my mouth...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he started touching me. I couldn't move, I was paralyzed with fear. I closed my eyes, wishing it would all go away. I could smell alcohol on his breath. He was saying things, horrible things... I felt so helpless, so violated...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I don't know how long it lasted. It felt like hours, but it was probably only minutes. When he finished, he just... left. I heard him go down the stairs and out the front door. I lay there, unable to move, for what seemed like forever. I was in shock, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Scared. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've finally said it out loud.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You've shown great strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting easier. I used to avoid thinking about it at all costs, but now... I can at least acknowledge it happened.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel physically right now?",
    "Client: My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel tense. But it's not as overwhelming as it used to be when I thought about that night.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *Takes a deep breath* That helps. It's strange, but I feel more in control now, even when talking about it. Like I'm observing it from a distance rather than reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still painful, but it doesn't consume me like it used to. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a positive sign. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's been a long journey, and I know I still have a way to go, but for the first time, I feel like I might actually be able to move past this someday.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I think. And a little proud of myself. I've carried this secret for so long, thinking I'd never be able to face it. But here I am, talking about it. It's hard, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I couldn't have done this without your support. It's still difficult to think about that night, but I feel like I'm starting to regain some control over my life. Like that man didn't take everything from me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. You're reclaiming your narrative.",
    "Client: Yes, that's exactly it. I'm not just a victim anymore. I'm a survivor. And I'm going to keep working on this until I can fully believe that.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. Our time is almost up. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good. Like I've accomplished something important. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. We'll continue next session."
