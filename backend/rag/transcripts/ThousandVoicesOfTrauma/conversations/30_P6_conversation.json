    "Therapist: Alright, Hamid. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of imprisonment. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I see the cold, gray walls of the cell. The air is stale, and there's a faint smell of mold. I'm sitting on a thin mattress on the floor, my back against the wall. My hands are shaking slightly, and I can feel a knot forming in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps approaching. They're slow, deliberate. Each step makes my heart race faster. I'm trying to control my breathing, but it's becoming more rapid. I... I feel so helpless, so alone.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6 or 7. My palms are sweating, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The footsteps stop outside my cell. There's a moment of silence that feels like an eternity. Then I hear the jangling of keys. The lock turns, and the door creaks open. I want to look away, but I can't. I see a guard standing there, his face emotionless. He says something, but I can barely hear it over the pounding of my heart.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. My whole body is tense, and I feel like I can't breathe properly. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Hamid. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'll try. The guard enters the cell. He's carrying a tray of food, but I'm not hungry. I'm too scared to eat. He puts the tray down and just stares at me. I feel so small, so insignificant. I want to disappear into the wall behind me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts talking. Telling me how worthless I am, how no one cares about me. Each word feels like a physical blow. I try to block it out, but I can't. It's like his words are burrowing into my brain. I feel tears starting to form, but I don't want to cry in front of him. I don't want to give him that satisfaction.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still... still a 9. My heart is racing so fast, I feel like it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I close my eyes, trying to shut everything out. But I can still hear his voice, still feel his presence. The neglect, the isolation, it's all crushing down on me. I feel so alone, so abandoned. Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense they're starting to ache. There's a heaviness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. I feel nauseous, and there's a ringing in my ears. It's... it's almost too much.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a little. Maybe an 8. I'm still scared, but... but I'm starting to remember that I'm here, in your office, not back in that cell.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great, Hamid.",
    "Client: The guard... he finally leaves. The door slams shut, and I hear the lock turn. I'm alone again, but I don't feel relieved. The silence is almost worse than his presence. I curl up on the mattress, trying to make myself as small as possible. I feel so helpless, so abandoned.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to calm down a bit. My breathing is slowing, and the tightness in my chest is easing. I'm reminding myself that it's over, that I survived.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I still feel shaky, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well, Hamid. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm opening my eyes now. The office looks so bright compared to that dark cell. I can feel the softness of the chair beneath me. I'm... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit proud. I didn't think I could do that, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. One last SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now. I feel... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Hamid. We'll end our session here."
