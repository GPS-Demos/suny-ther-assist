    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital room. It's dimly lit, and I can hear the beeping of machines. The air feels cold and sterile. I'm lying on the bed, and I can see the nurses moving around, but they're not looking at me. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I can see the doctor coming in now. He's holding a clipboard, and his face looks serious. I remember feeling my heart racing, thinking something must be terribly wrong. The fear is overwhelming. I want to ask what's happening, but my throat feels tight, and I can't speak.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The doctor starts talking, but his words are muffled at first. Then I hear him say \"human trafficking ring\" and \"evidence of abuse.\" I feel like I'm falling into a dark pit. How could this happen? I'm just here for a routine check-up. This can't be real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. The room is spinning. I see the nurse's face, she looks concerned, but she's not helping me. Why isn't anyone helping me? I feel so exposed, so violated. I want to scream, to run away, but I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember the shame washing over me. How could I not have known? How could I have let this happen? The doctor is still talking, mentioning police and investigations, but all I can think about is how my life is falling apart. I feel so stupid, so naive. I trusted the wrong people, and now... now I'm here.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I see flashes of faces. People I thought were friends, people who betrayed me. The realization hits me like a punch to the gut. All those times I felt uneasy but ignored it. All those \"jobs\" that never felt quite right. It's all becoming clear now, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor is asking me questions now, but I can barely hear him over the roaring in my ears. I feel like I'm watching myself from outside my body. I see my lips moving, answering questions, but I don't know what I'm saying. I just want this to be over. I want to wake up and realize it's all a bad dream.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I remember looking down at my hands. They're shaking uncontrollably. I can see bruises I never noticed before. How long has this been going on? How could I have been so blind? I feel a mix of anger and despair washing over me. I want to cry, to scream, to break something, but I just sit there, numb and silent.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The doctor is telling me about support services now, but his words sound far away. All I can think about is how my life will never be the same. I feel so alone, so betrayed. I don't know who to trust anymore. I'm scared of what will happen next, of facing the world outside this hospital room. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're being incredibly strong. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I remember the moment when it all became too much. The doctor stopped talking, and there was this heavy silence in the room. I could hear my own ragged breathing. And then, I just broke down. Tears started flowing, and I couldn't stop them. It was like years of suppressed emotions all came out at once. I felt so vulnerable, so exposed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: Through my tears, I could see the nurse approach with a box of tissues. Her kindness, that simple gesture, it made me cry even harder. Because for the first time in so long, someone was showing me genuine care. And it made me realize how much I had been missing that. How much I had been going through alone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this remarkably well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I remember trying to pull myself together. I wiped my eyes and tried to focus on what the doctor was saying about next steps. But my mind kept drifting. I thought about my family, my friends. How would I tell them? Would they believe me? Would they blame me? The fear of their reactions was almost as overwhelming as the situation itself.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those concerns. You're safe here.",
    "Client: As the doctor finished speaking, I felt this strange mix of relief and dread. Relief that the truth was finally out, that I wasn't crazy for feeling something was wrong all this time. But also dread about what comes next. The investigations, the questions, having to relive everything... It felt like standing on the edge of a cliff, knowing I had to jump but terrified of the fall.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like sharing this burden makes it a little lighter. I'm still scared and angry, but I also feel a tiny spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've done excellent work today."
