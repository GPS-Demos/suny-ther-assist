    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my emotions are all over the place. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of my mom in the hospital bed, it's just so vivid now. I can almost smell the disinfectant and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt, I think. It's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how I wasn't there when she... when she passed. I was at uni, trying to finish an assignment. I thought I had more time, you know? God, I should have been there.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I feel sick to my stomach, and my throat feels tight. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about it. I just... I can't shake the feeling that I let her down in her final moments.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying our last conversation. She told me not to worry, to focus on my studies. But I should have known better. I should have seen how serious it was. I'm her daughter, for crying out loud! How could I have been so blind? And now... now I can never make it right.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you?",
    "Client: They're... they're crushing. It's like I'm constantly beating myself up. I have trouble concentrating on my studies now because I feel like I don't deserve to succeed. Sometimes I think about dropping out altogether. What's the point of a degree if I couldn't even be there for my own mother?",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm angry too. At myself, obviously, but also at the doctors. They said we had weeks, maybe months. But it was only days. I feel like they robbed me of my chance to say goodbye properly. And then I feel guilty for being angry because I know they did their best. It's just... it's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does this confusion manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like my mind is in constant turmoil. One moment I'm sad, the next I'm angry, then I'm back to feeling guilty. I can't seem to settle on any one emotion. It's exhausting. I'm not sleeping well, and when I do, I often dream about her. Sometimes they're good dreams, and I wake up happy for a split second before reality crashes back in. Those moments... they're the worst.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your relationships since this happened?",
    "Client: I've been pulling away from people. My friends try to help, but they don't really understand. How could they? I feel like I'm wearing a mask most of the time, pretending to be okay when I'm falling apart inside. And dating? Forget about it. The idea of getting close to someone terrifies me now. What if I lose them too?",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory affect your current life?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a dark cloud that follows me everywhere. Even when I'm doing something I used to enjoy, like watching a movie or going for a run, the memory is always there in the background. I catch myself thinking, \"Mom would have loved this,\" or \"I wish I could tell Mom about this.\" And then the guilt comes crashing back. It's affecting everything - my studies, my friendships, my ability to plan for the future. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: What do you think your mom would say about your feelings?",
    "Client: (long pause) I... I think she'd be sad to see me like this. She was always so proud of me, always pushing me to do my best. She'd probably tell me to stop being so hard on myself. (voice breaking) But it's so hard. I miss her so much, and I just can't shake the feeling that I failed her when it mattered most.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining her response make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels comforted, like maybe she really wouldn't blame me. But another part feels even more guilty for disappointing her by not living up to her expectations. And then there's this overwhelming sadness because I can imagine her voice so clearly, but I know I'll never actually hear it again. It's like losing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to say to her if you could?",
    "Client: (tears welling up) I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry I wasn't there. And I love you. I love you so much, and I hope you knew that. I hope you still know that, wherever you are. (crying) I'm trying to make you proud, Mom. I really am. I just... I just wish you were here to see it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel after sharing that?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My chest feels a bit lighter, but my heart is aching. It's like I've opened up this wound that I've been trying to ignore. But at the same time, there's a small sense of relief. Like maybe it's okay to feel all of this, to let it out instead of bottling it up. I don't know if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I just need a moment. This is all so raw, you know? Maybe... maybe some water? And just... time to process all of this. It's a lot to take in, reliving it all like that. But I think... I think it might be helping, even if it doesn't feel great right now.",
