    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving that moment when I witnessed the car accident... it's bringing up so many emotions. I feel drained, but also... maybe a bit relieved? It's strange.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The screeching tires, the crash, and then... the silence. It was deafening. I remember feeling frozen, like I couldn't move or even breathe. And the guilt... why couldn't I do more to help?",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that same panic rising in my chest. But... it was different this time. I knew I was safe here, even though the memory felt so real. It's like... I could observe it without being completely overwhelmed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see how these memories have been affecting me. The constant vigilance when I'm driving or even walking near roads. The nightmares. It's all connected to that moment. But going through it here, it feels like... maybe I can start to separate the past from the present?",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding busy intersections and highways. It's impacting my work, my relationships. My spouse has been so patient, but I know it's been hard on them too. Going through this exposure... it's challenging, but I feel like I'm finally addressing the root of the problem.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this connecting to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I want to be able to drive without constant fear. To sleep through the night without reliving the accident. And to stop feeling guilty for something I couldn't control. This process... it's hard, but I think it's helping me face these fears head-on.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage. What's been most helpful?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been a lifeline. When I feel overwhelmed, focusing on my breath helps ground me. And... talking about it here, in a safe space. It's like... the more I face it, the less power it has over me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but determined. Each session is challenging, but I leave feeling a bit stronger. It's like I'm reclaiming parts of myself that I thought I'd lost. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment. I'm starting to have hope that I can overcome this trauma and live a full life again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'm ready to keep facing this. It's tough, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I'm on the right path."
