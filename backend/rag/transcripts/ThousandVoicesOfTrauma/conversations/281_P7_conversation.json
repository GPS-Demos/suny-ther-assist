    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the incident with the police?",
    "Client: It was a routine medical check-up at the hospital. I was waiting in the lobby when suddenly, there was a commotion. A group of police officers rushed in, shouting and pushing people aside. I was confused and scared. One of them grabbed me roughly by the arm, accusing me of being a suspect they were looking for. I tried to explain that I was just there for a check-up, but they wouldn't listen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They slammed me against the wall, and I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I have a heart condition, and I was terrified it might trigger an attack. I kept pleading with them, telling them they had the wrong person, but they just got more aggressive. The more I tried to explain, the angrier they became. I could feel my heart racing, and I was having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I felt so helpless. People were watching, but no one stepped in to help. The officers were yelling at me, using racial slurs. I've never felt so humiliated and scared in my life. I thought I was going to die right there in the hospital lobby. My wife had passed away just a few months before, and all I could think was that I would never see my children again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, a nurse recognized me and intervened. She told the officers I was a regular patient and couldn't possibly be their suspect. They finally let me go, but they didn't even apologize. I was shaking uncontrollably, and the nurse had to help me sit down. I felt so weak and vulnerable. Since then, I've been terrified of going to the hospital or seeing police officers. I can't sleep at night, and I keep reliving that moment over and over again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing it.",
    "Client: I feel so angry and betrayed. I've always taught my children to respect authority, but how can I do that now? I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. Every time I see a police officer, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I'm back in that moment. I've been avoiding leaving my house as much as possible. I'm afraid it might happen again, and next time, there might not be anyone to help me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part is the shame. I feel like I should have done something differently, like I should have been able to prevent it somehow. I keep wondering if it was something about the way I looked or acted that made them target me. I've lost all confidence in myself. I used to be proud of my professional achievements, but now I feel like none of that matters. How can I face my colleagues or clients when I feel so broken inside?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Keep expressing those feelings.",
    "Client: I miss my wife so much. She would have known how to help me through this. Without her, I feel so alone and vulnerable. My children are worried about me, but I don't want to burden them with my problems. They have their own lives to live. Sometimes, I think it would have been better if I had died that day. At least then I wouldn't have to live with this constant fear and pain.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: I've started having nightmares about the incident. In my dreams, there's no nurse to save me, and the officers... they... (voice breaks) they beat me to death. I wake up in a cold sweat, gasping for air. I'm afraid to go back to sleep. During the day, I'm exhausted and can't concentrate on anything. My work is suffering, and I'm worried I might lose my job. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I know I need to. I want to get better, to feel safe again. I want to be able to go to the hospital without panicking, to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to be the strong father my children need. But right now, it feels like that's impossible. Like I'll never be the same person I was before this happened.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a little lighter. Talking about it is hard, but keeping it all inside was even harder. I'm still scared and angry, but maybe there's a small part of me that feels hopeful. Like maybe, with time and help, I might be able to overcome this. I just wish it didn't hurt so much.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you for listening. For not judging me. I've been so afraid to talk about this with anyone, worried they might think I'm weak or overreacting. But here, I feel like I can be honest about how much this has affected me. I know I have a long way to go, but maybe this is the first step towards healing. I just hope I have the strength to keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. There's more I need to say, more I need to process. It's painful, but I think it's necessary. I want to talk about the aftermath, about how this has affected my daily life. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Go ahead when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. After the incident, I couldn't bring myself to go back to that hospital. I missed several important check-ups for my heart condition. I know it's dangerous, but the thought of walking through those doors again... it paralyzes me. I've been having more frequent chest pains, but I've been ignoring them. Part of me is scared that if I go to the hospital, something like that might happen again. Another part... well, another part almost doesn't care what happens to me anymore.",
    "Therapist: I hear your fear. Keep going.",
    "Client: My relationship with my children has changed too. They've noticed how withdrawn I've become, how I flinch at loud noises or when someone approaches me unexpectedly. My daughter wanted to take me out for my birthday last month, but I made up an excuse not to go. The idea of being in a crowded restaurant, with so many unknowns... I just couldn't do it. I could see the hurt in her eyes, but I didn't know how to explain it to her.",
    "Therapist: You're being very honest. That's important.",
    "Client: I feel like I'm letting everyone down. My late wife would be so disappointed in me. She always admired my strength, my ability to overcome challenges. But now, I feel like a shell of my former self. I used to take pride in my appearance, in staying fit and healthy. Now, most days I can barely find the energy to get out of bed and shower. I've gained weight, I'm not exercising... I'm just existing, not living.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to struggle. You're facing this.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I find myself getting irrationally angry. The other day, I saw a police car drive by my house, and I felt this surge of rage. I wanted to scream at them, to make them feel as helpless as I did. But then I remembered how that anger made the officers treat me, and I felt ashamed. I don't want to become like them. I don't want this incident to change who I am at my core.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great self-awareness. Continue.",
    "Client: I've been thinking a lot about my cultural background too. As a South Asian man, I was raised to respect authority, to believe in the system. This incident has shaken that belief to its core. I feel like I don't belong in this country anymore, like I'll always be seen as an outsider, a potential threat. It's making me question everything - my identity, my place in society, even my decision to immigrate here all those years ago.",
    "Therapist: These are complex feelings. You're processing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I know I need to find a way to move forward, to reclaim my life. But right now, it feels like there's this insurmountable wall between who I was before and who I am now. I want to tear it down, but I don't know how. I want to feel safe again, to trust again, to live again. But I'm scared that I'll never be able to fully recover from this.",
    "Therapist: Your desire to heal is powerful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... raw. Exposed. But also, maybe a little relieved? Talking about it like this, really diving into all these emotions and memories, it's exhausting. But it also feels like I'm finally acknowledging the full impact of what happened to me. Like I'm giving myself permission to feel all of these complex emotions instead of trying to push them down. It's scary, but also... maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. Shall we pause here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that might be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's hope for me to heal and move forward."

But now, I feel like a shell of my former self. I used to take pride in my appearance, in staying fit and healthy. Now, most days I can barely find the energy to get out of bed and shower. I've gained weight, I'm not exercising... I'm just existing, not living.",
